While many of these laws imposed by states are designed to keep citizens safe, others are weird, strange or just downright silly. And, believe it or not, you can get fined   or worse   for violating them. From Alabama to Wyoming, click through the slideshow to see some of the most ridiculous laws that have been on the books. Alabama: Throwing Confetti in the City of Mobile Mobile, Ala., might be the birthplace of Mardi Gras, but that doesn't mean you can carry or toss confetti to celebrate. The glittery stuff is illegal to use or sell within the city or police jurisdiction under the Alabama littering code, according to the private legal publisher, Municode. Throwing confetti results in a $16 fine and $106 in court costs, according to city code. This Is No Joke: The Weirdest Money Fact About Every State Alaska: Speaking Too Loudly Do you have a habit of talking loudly to get your point across?

That would be considered disturbing the peace, according to city code. You could be slapped with a $450 fine for being a loudmouth. Arizona: Spitting on the Sidewalk If you spit publicly in the city of Goodyear, whether on a public walkway, street, park or the ground, you could face up to six months in jail and a fine of $2,500.

Along with its weird fines and laws, Arkansas is also known for some interesting state taxes .

Connecticut: Having More Than 4 Amusement Devices Per Arcade An arcade in Rocky Hill, Conn., should not have more than four mechanical amusement devices   including coin-slot operated machines and pinball machines, according to the city government ordinance. The way the law is written, video games might be okay, but that could just be because the law is outdated. Violators could face a $25 fine per day. Delaware: Selling Pet Fur Never use pet hair as monetary leverage in Delaware. It's a Class B misdemeanor to sell, barter or offer the fur of a domestic dog or cat, according to the state government website. This includes selling any product made from the hair, which could result in a fine of $2,500 and a ban on owning a dog or cat for 15 years.

BBEY0sP	finance	ads-aol-divorce	Blame it on the money: 6 reasons marriages fail	There are many reasons marriages fail. Here are a few ways money takes its toll.	There are many reasons marriages fail. Here are a few ways money takes its toll. Blame It on the Money Ask any long-wed couple and they'll tell you making a marriage work takes much more than love. Lasting marriages are built upon a foundation of trust, loyalty, respect and mutual goals. Most couples recognize this on emotional, physical and even spiritual levels; however, many fail to apply the same consideration to their finances. When spouses do not properly manage finances, struggle to talk to one another about money or cannot be honest about their individual spending, tension builds. In some cases, ongoing tension leads to separation or divorce. Read on to discover some of the most common ways finances cause rifts between married couples, and learn how you can prevent money matters from chipping away at your marriage . 1. Couples Don't Talk About Financial Stress Stress sets the stage for unhappiness, and finances are a big-time contributor to stress. In a 2015 survey by SunTrust Bank, 35 percent of married couples named money as the leading cause of relationship stress . What makes financial stress worse, though, is that many couples don't talk openly to one another about their money burdens. "Talking about money is difficult for most couples because we usually don't grow up in our families having positive discussions about money," said Melissa Divaris Thompson, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in New York City. "Money is something that can very quickly and easily go underground and not [get] talked about. It's uncomfortable, and most families feel it's too private to share even with adult children." Tip: Ease Into the Conversation or Find an Adviser Couples who do not currently talk about stress as it relates to finances should allow themselves to gradually open the discussion rather than diving fully in at once, Divaris Thompson said. When you talk about money a little bit everyday, your conversations will get easier and feel more normal. Additionally, couples can meet with an objective third party, such as a financial adviser. A professional will guide your conversations, which will help prevent flare-ups and major disagreements. "Meet with a financial planner or adviser. Sit down and talk openly about your financial picture and how you both want to grow," Divaris Thompson said. 2. One or Both Spouses Secretly Spend According to a 2015 report by CreditCards.com, an online credit card marketplace, one in five of the people reported spending $500 or more on a credit card without revealing the purchase to their spouses. The report also showed that roughly 7.2 million Americans have hidden a credit card or bank account from their live-in partners or spouses. While some couples agree not to share bank accounts or credit cards, keeping their own finances largely separate, any purchase that could significantly affect you both or your family is important to share. If you're going out of your way to hide purchases, your relationship could really suffer. "To hide purchases from your partner sets up a dynamic to not be open and honest about your financial choices," Divaris Thompson said. "It creates distrust in the relationship and breaks down your integrity. Your partner is also then set up to become the 'financial police,' and this will build resentment in your relationship." Tip: Stop the Secrets If your spouse is showing signs of lying about his or her spending , you should confront him or her in a non-combative way. If you aren't confident that you can keep your cool during a discussion, seek the help of an objective third party, such as a therapist. If you are concealing or lying about purchases, you need to end the habit pronto. Should the temptation to hide arise, ask yourself why you feel the need to not disclose the information, and pinpoint any underlying issues in need of addressing. 3. Some Husbands Can't Handle Their Wives Making More Money Nearly 38 percent of wives earn more money than their husbands in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While women's salaries have changed in recent decades, societal perceptions of money-related gender roles have evolved not as quickly. As a result, some men struggle emotionally when their wives make more money. "In our society, men have historically been the breadwinners," Divaris Thompson said. "Being in a heterosexual couple where the woman makes more money can set up a dynamic that may be uncomfortable for a man. Usually partners feel that whomever (sic) makes more money, even on a subconscious level, may hold more power." Meanwhile, women continue to do a significantly larger share of household chores, even when they make a higher income. Women, on average, spend more than twice as much time housecleaning and preparing food and over three times as much time doing laundry compared with men, according to a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. If such a setup contributes to resentment, exhaustion and heightened stress, money-related tension and divorce risks might run even higher. Tip: Tell Your Partner How You Feel If you are a married male who struggles to accept that your wife makes more money than you, talk about your feelings with your partner, a therapist or both. Awareness alone can go a long way toward salvaging relationship satisfaction, and it sets the stage for positive action such as more evenly sharing the housework load. 4. Couples Live Beyond Their Means, Fueling Anxiety No matter what your financial means   or who makes more money   overspending is one of the reasons marriages fail. It's also extremely common. In research released by the Pew Charitable Trust in 2015, 57 percent of people surveyed said they didn't consider themselves prepared for an abrupt financial setback. Fifty-five percent said they broke even or spent more than they brought in each month, and about a third of responders reported having no savings at all. For couples, this is problematic on multiple levels, according to Divaris Thompson. "When you live beyond your means, there is always a level of anxiety associated with that," she said. "Whether you know the credit card bill is coming soon or wonder constantly if you can cover your bills, this can lead to feelings of unease." The greater your level of anxiety, the greater your risk of feeling disconnected from your partner, particularly if he or she is the bigger spender. Love and Money: Surprising Ways Money Affects Your Love Life Tip: Create a Plan Together To keep overspending from dismantling your marriage, Divaris Thompson suggested sharing your fears and anxious feelings with your partner and then creating a plan together for positive change. Develop a budget, explore creative ways to save funds to better stay within your means, and check in regularly to hold each other accountable. Simply starting the conversation can help protect your marriage, she said. 5. Couples Spend Too Much Time Trying to Make Money Maintaining a strong marriage takes work, time and energy. If you spend nearly all of your time and energy at the office, you won't have much left over for keeping the relationship spark alive. It should come as no surprise, then, that overwork can fuel the likelihood of divorce. "In a solid relationship, you want to feel valued and a priority," Divaris Thompson said. "For a partner that prioritizes work, this can lead to feelings of resentment and anger in the relationship." Americans are more prone to overworking than any other population in the world. More than 85 percent of men and 66 percent of women in the U.S. work more than 40 hours per week, according to a 2017 CreditLoan report. Tip: Set Clear Expectations To help keep overwork from undermining your relationship, Divaris Thompson said couples must find balance. "Make sure you both agree on what that picture looks like between work/life balance," she said. You can also each take advantage of a few easy ways to make money off of your marriage . 6. Couples Argue About Money Some experts believe that spousal arguments about money are the leading predictor of divorce. One of the most comprehensive recent studies on the subject drew on data collected from more than 4,500 couples and showed that, regardless of debt, income and net worth, money arguments were the biggest divorce red flag. Not only do money issues frequently come up in arguments, but they tend to lead to more intense and frequent fights as well   understandably so, said Divaris Thompson. "Financial issues lend themselves to more frequent or intense arguments because money is usually not a subject that couples are that up front, honest or proactive about discussing," she said. "This can lead to blowups down the road." Tip: Have Ongoing Conversations About Your Finances Improving your communication habits around money and addressing any issues head on to prevent arguments   ideally sooner rather than later   can save you and your spouse a lot of tension, paving the way for longer-lasting relationship bliss.

If you want to experience a beautiful vacation without the hassle of navigating a crowd, check out these underrated tourist hotspots. Underrated Tourist Destinations Around the World From beautiful beaches to amazing mountain towns , there are some destinations everyone should see in a lifetime. But most of these vacation hotspots are packed with tourists hoping to experience the same adventure. Maybe it's time to ditch the crowds and seek out an underrated vacation spot. While these locations might not be totally unknown to the frequent traveler, they might not get as much love or attention as popular stops like Miami, Paris or celebrity vacation hotspots like Aspen or Ibiza. Some are bustling cities and others are historic towns, but one common theme unites them: they are all underrated. Bayahibe, Dominican Republic Most travelers think of Punta Cana when considering a trip to the Dominican Republic, but Bayahibe offers local charm with more secluded beaches and some of the country's best places to scuba dive. When you want to take a break from water activities, Bayahibe has ranches where tourists can go horseback riding and a jungle river tour that lets tourists visit the locations of famous films like "Apocalypse Now" and "Jurassic Park." Bozeman, Montana Bozeman, Montana, is full of fun, with some of the best doughnuts in America and one of the most popular ski resorts , but it's also a cute, quaint destination with something for everyone.

Waterfalls, rainforests and beaches all with a sunny backdrop make Cairns an idyllic destination where it's summer all the time . But possibly the best thing to see in Cairns is the Great Barrier Reef. Take a guided boat tour to explore the waters over the reef or, if you're feeling adventurous, go snorkeling. Charlotte, North Carolina One word defines why Charlotte, North Carolina, is a destination worth the trip: NASCAR. More than 85% of NASCAR teams are located in the area, along with the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Time your trip right and you can see the Coca-Cola 600 race at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. And if race cars aren't your thing, try riding the world's tallest and fastest giga coaster   the 325-foot-tall Fury 325 at Carowinds amusement park   or visiting the U.S. National Whitewater Center, where you can participate in activities that range from outdoor yoga to mountain climbing. Cleveland, Ohio Chicago often tops the list of Midwestern cities to visit, but Cleveland is a seriously underrated destination that deserves just as much love. One of the best indoor places in America for fun   the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame   is a must-see for any music fan, and Cleveland has a host of other exciting things to do, including world-class museums, some of the best food in Ohio and exciting sports events from the Indians, Cavs and Browns.

Dakar, Senegal Dakar, the capital of Senegal, combines rich history with vibrant modern culture. Visitors can relax or surf along the coast, dance the night away at Le Vogue, a nightclub, or shop at the famous Village des Arts, a complex where local artists create and sell their wares. Darwin, Australia Darwin, Australia, is a warm-weather destination with many fun adventures worth trying. When you're not enjoying great eats, swim with the crocodiles in Crocosaurus Cove's "Cage of Death'' or go bushwalking or snorkeling at Berry Springs. And after you're done enjoying daring activities, take a relaxing walk through the Mindil Beach Sunset Market. Dubrovnik, Croatia Fantasy fans need to add Dubrovnik, Croatia, to their travel bucket list ASAP. This city may be best known as the main filming location for King's Landing in HBO's hit series "Game of Thrones." The city offers themed tours that take travelers on an adventure throughout the city to discover more about the city's history and the making of the show. You'll feel like you've been transported back in time .

Phuket, Thailand Bangkok is a popular tourist destination in Thailand, but not too far away, and much more secluded, is Phuket. Visit Big Buddha, a sacred 147-foot Maravija Buddha statue, lounge on a white sand beach or enjoy a romantic view of sunrises and sunsets over pristine blue waters. Quebec City, Canada If you want a French-Canadian vacation free of the Montreal crowds that is still rich with history at an affordable rate , Quebec City should be at the top of your travel list.

With its somewhat lackluster interior and rough-shifting transmission, it fails to stand out among most rivals.	The 2018 Lincoln Continental finishes near the bottom of our luxury large car rankings. With its somewhat lackluster interior and rough-shifting transmission, it fails to stand out among most rivals. Is the Lincoln Continental a Good Car? The Lincoln Continental is a decent car, but there are better choices in the luxury large car class . It has a powerful engine lineup, a comfortable ride, plush front seats, a long list of standard and available features, and an above-average predicted reliability rating. However, many rivals in the class deliver more agile handling, stronger engine options, or better fuel efficiency (and in a few cases, all three). You can also find competitors with more advanced tech features and nicer cabins. Should I Buy the Lincoln Continental? If you're shopping for a big luxury sedan, the Continental shouldn't be your first choice. Unless, of course, your budget is a little tight. If that's the case, you may like the Continental for its lowest-in-class starting price. Still, there are many rivals out there that provide more bang for your buck or are all-around better cars. The Cadillac CT6 and Volvo S90 are both more expensive than the Lincoln, but they're also better options. They have the posh interiors you'd expect from a luxury vehicle, along with solid driving dynamics. The Lincoln MKZ will save you lots of money over the Continental   just note it is a smaller vehicle. Should I Buy a New or Used Lincoln Continental? Lincoln resurrected the Continental as an all-new model for the 2017 model year. The Continental saw no changes for 2018, so if you're open to driving a used car, you could likely save money and get a nearly identical car with the 2017 Continental. To do more research about a used model, check out our review of the 2017 Lincoln Continental . If you decide an older model is right for you, check out our Used Car Deals page for information on incentives on used vehicles. We Did the Research for You: 23 Reviews Analyzed We analyzed 23 Lincoln Continental reviews   along with safety and reliability ratings, fuel economy estimates, and more   to help you decide if the 2018 Continental is the right new car for you. This 2018 Lincoln Continental review incorporates applicable research for all model years in this generation, which spans the 2017 and 2018 model years. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News & World Report has been ranking and reviewing cars, trucks, and SUVs since 2007, and our editorial team has more than 75 years of combined experience in the auto industry. To ensure our reviews are unbiased, we don't accept expensive gifts or incentives from car companies, and a third party handles our advertising. How Much Does the Lincoln Continental Cost? The Continental's base (Premiere trim) price is around $45,000, which is one of the lowest starting prices in the class. There are three higher trims (Select, Reserve, and Black Label), with the top-of-the-line Black Label starting at around $69,600. That's still lower than some competitors' base prices. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Lincoln dealer. Lincoln Continental Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Lincoln Continental or Cadillac CT6? The Cadillac CT6 has arguably the nicest interior in the class, and it stays quiet inside even at highway speeds. While both the Continental and CT6 have comfortable and spacious front seats, the Cadillac offers more rear headroom for taller passengers. The CT6 also has one of the longest features lists in the class. Like the Continental, the CT6 offers several engine options, but its base engine gets better gas mileage than any of the Continental's powertrains. The Cadillac's highest trim also has a more powerful engine than anything in the Continental's lineup. While the Continental is tuned for comfortable cruising, the CT6 exhibits more agility when driving. All things considered, the CT6 is a better buy than the Continental. Which Is Better: Lincoln Continental or Volvo S90? The Volvo S90 is a well-rounded luxury midsize sedan. It retails for just a few thousand dollars more than the Continental. For your money, you'll get loads of high-tech features and technology, including many semiautonomous driving functions. The S90 is also incredibly refined inside and offers ample space and comfort wherever you sit. Both cars have solid engine options and composed handling, but the S90 has better acceleration due to its lighter weight and supercharged engine. The S90's trunk is a bit smaller, but overall the Volvo is the better bet. Which Is Better: Lincoln Continental or Lincoln MKZ? The Lincoln Continental and Lincoln MKZ have a lot of similarities, including features availability, interior quality, and ride comfort. As a luxury midsize sedan, the MKZ costs a lot less than its larger sibling   but you'll also sacrifice some cabin space. Those who prioritize fuel efficiency should check out the MKZ's available hybrid powertrain, which gets significantly better mileage than both the Continental and MKZ base engines. If you need extra cargo and passenger space, go with the Continental. Otherwise, save some money by getting the MKZ. Compare the Continental, S90, and MKZ » Continental Interior How Many People Does the Continental Seat? The Continental seats five and is easy to get into and out of thanks to its large doors. The intuitive E-Latch exterior door handles operate electronically, providing a soft open and close. The front seats are among the best in the class. The rear seats have plenty of legroom, but headroom is tight for taller people. Continental and Car Seats This Lincoln has two full sets of LATCH car-seat connectors. The tether anchors are easy to find and identify, but the lower anchors are set a little too deep in the seat. Other than that, the anchors are easy to use. Continental Interior Quality The Continental has a quality interior and uses high-end materials in general. However, there are a few spots where materials quality is lacking, leaving this Lincoln a notch below the competition. Continental Cargo Space The Continental's trunk has 16.7 cubic feet of space, which is smaller than some rivals' trunks. The available hands-free power trunk lid is a nice feature, and the trunk's opening is nice and wide. The liftover height is low as well. Unfortunately, because of the trunk's shape   wide but not that deep   you might not be able to fit bulky items. Still, nearly 17 cubic feet is plenty of room for several sets of golf clubs or more than a dozen shopping bags. Continental Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The Continental's standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10-speaker audio system, satellite radio, and the SYNC 3 infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen and voice recognition. Available features include tri-zone automatic climate control, two rear-seat USB charging ports, two Revel audio systems, and navigation. There's no shortage of technology available in this Lincoln, and the SYNC 3 infotainment system lets you control things from a user-friendly touch screen. There are even physical controls for many functions if that's more your speed. But it's worth noting that many rivals have more advanced tech features than the Continental. Continental Performance Continental Engine: Go for Turbo You have three V6 engine choices in the Continental sedan. The base engine puts out 305 horsepower and has adequate power for daily driving   but not much else. The 400-horsepower twin-turbocharged engine delivers plenty of power and acceleration, but it also costs the most. The best choice is the 335-horsepower turbocharged V6, which has quick acceleration and feels nearly as strong as the 400-horsepower engine. All engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that will likely disappoint you with its erratic, rough shifts. Continental Gas Mileage: Not This Lincoln's Strong Suit With the base engine, the Continental gets 17 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway, which are below-average ratings for a luxury large car. The 335-horsepower engine gets the best ratings (18/27 mpg city/highway), though they're only slightly better than what the base engine gets. It's worth noting that the Continental takes regular gasoline, whereas many rivals require premium. Still, the Continental will cost you a little more each year in gas money than the Cadillac CT6 . It will save you about $250 per year compared to the Mercedes-Benz CLS , though the Mercedes-Benz does have a V8 engine. Continental Ride and Handling: Take a Cruise The Continental's soft ride and composed handling make it a great cruising vehicle. It's not the most athletic car, but it maneuvers well despite its size and has sturdy brakes. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. Continental Reliability Is the Lincoln Continental Reliable? The 2018 Lincoln Continental has an above-average predicted reliability rating of four out of five from J.D Power. Three is considered average. Lincoln Continental Warranty Lincoln covers the Continental with a four-year/50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a six-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. These are good warranty terms for a luxury large car. Continental Safety Continental Crash Test Results The 2018 Lincoln Continental sedan earned five out of five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It was also named a 2018 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick+, which is the organization's highest honor. The Continental received that distinction after earning a Good rating in all six physical crash tests and its headlight performance, as well as a Superior rating for its forward crash prevention systems. Continental Safety Features Standard driver assistance features include front and rear parking sensors, park assist, a rearview camera, and MyKey, which lets you set speed and audio volume limits for others driving your car. Available features include blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, pre-collision automatic braking, pedestrian detection, enhanced park assist, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, and a 360-degree camera system. Which Lincoln Continental Model Is Right for Me? There are four Continental trims, and all feature one of three V6 engines. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all trims are available with all-wheel drive for an extra $2,000. Unless you must have the premium luxury features, the Select trim is a great choice. It has a lower starting price than many other cars in the class, and it's available with plenty of comfort and convenience features. Lincoln Continental Premiere The Continental Premiere has a starting price of around $45,160. It comes with the base V6 engine, and it doesn't offer anything notable beyond the standard features. Lincoln Continental Select The Continental Select starts at around $49,370. In addition to the base features, the Select comes with a hands-free power trunk lid, two USB ports for rear-seat passengers, and navigation. The Select is available with the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 for $2,250. You can add a moonroof for $1,750 and 30-way power-adjustable massaging front seats for $1,500. The Climate package ($850) adds heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel. You can also add a 13-speaker Revel audio system for $1,130. Lincoln Continental Reserve The Continental Reserve has a starting price of $54,785. It comes with the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 engine, 24-way power-adjustable front seats, ventilated front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, navigation, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. The Technology package (about $4,200) adds lane keep assist, active park assist, adaptive cruise control, collision warning, a 360-degree camera, and many more features. The Rear Seat package ($4,300) includes heated and cooled rear seats, power-reclining rear seats, a twin-panel moonroof, and more. You can also add the Climate package, the massaging front seats, the moonroof, and a 19-speaker Revel audio system as standalone options. Lincoln Continental Black Label The Continental Black Label starts at $69,630. It comes with upgraded leather upholstery, HD Radio, the 19-speaker Revel audio system, and a heated steering wheel. It offers the same option packages as the Reserve trim. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Lincoln dealer. The Final Call The 2018 Lincoln Continental is a good car, but it finishes near the bottom of our class rankings because many rivals are simply better vehicles. The Lincoln has powerful available engines, rides smoothly, and is comfortable inside, but it's not a class leader in any of these areas. If you're looking at luxury large cars , there are better options that provide more value. Don't just take our word for it.

AA2ISfW	autos	autosnews	First Drive: 2009 BMW 335i Coupe	You know this car. The current 3 Series has been around for close to five years, but it remains the target of every automaker looking to make a name for itself in the mid-size luxury segment. Read about the 2009 BMW 335i Coupe in this first drive article brought to you by the automotive experts at Motor Trend.	You know this car. The current 3 Series has been around for close to five years, but it remains the target of every automaker looking to make a name for itself in the mid-size luxury segment -- and it's the standard by which they are measured. Now, it fills the driveways of the suburbs, the streets of L.A., and the pages of magazines. This car? Played out like a Top 40 track. So why devote more space to it? Because all that overexposure still hasn't diluted it. The BMW 335i Coupe smartly blends luxury and sport; it's as content zooming along a winding country road as it is motoring along the bleakest of freeways during those endless road trips. Part of its flexibility can be attributed to BMW's much-lauded twin-turbo straight six under hood. It's an engine that's not long for this world, as a more fuel-efficient, single-turbo version is in the offing from Munich. We'll miss the twin-turbo's stout powerband and overall tractability. It's deceivingly smooth -- you'll find yourself climbing well above posted speed limits if you don't pay attention. It's docile at low rpm, but surges through the tach with immediacy at a squeeze of the throttle. The EPA rates the two-door 335i at 17/26 mpg. We averaged 25.3 mpg hwy/hooligan combined. Lag is a non-issue. In fact, the 335i accelerates as though it has a large displacement engine, not a turbocharged one. Peak torque, 300 lb-ft, is on tap from 1400-5000 rpm. And the claimed 300 hp leads us to believe BMW is being bashful: The last 335i manual we tested reached 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. But the acceleration isn't the point. What's most impressive is the sensation behind the wheel, the ease of disposing the 5-20 mph shuffle of L.A. freeways, the reward of wide-open throttle upshifts. No sporty pretense here. Revs fall quickly between shifts, a welcome change compared to the abnormal amount of time many of today's engines take. The clutch, which can feel light at first, offers the right feedback, while the shifter slots neatly into each cog. The taut ride calls out road imperfections and changes in surface through the cabin, while the delightfully thick-rimmed steering wheel transmits the desires of the rubber on the road. Once you fall into the rhythm, every bend presents an opportunity to drop a gear, buzz redline, and hear the sonorous 3.0L song. Aiding the back road joy are 19-in wheels with upgraded rubber ($1000), and the Sport Package ($1550), which ups the speed limiter and adds sports seats and dark exterior trim. The upgraded rollers and Crimson Red paint highlight the sharp lines of the well-proportioned body. The looks are enough to understand why BMW largely passed on a visual refresh for the 3 Series coupe last year, instead giving the sedan a substantial facelift with a new front clip, among others touches. The coupe remains handsome. Interior styling puts the emphasis is on business, not glamour. The sole embellishment is LED illumination along the doors, adding a graceful line along the cabin. Quality materials are apparent with every touch, from the plush leather to the dash. Our car featured iPod integration and a USB adapter ($400), but not the improved iDrive system and its 8.8-in screen. Yet the tiny radio display proved surprisingly adept at scrolling through 30 GB of music. Complaints? We wish BMW would adopt a second illumination color: The ever-present orange glow at night can grow tiresome. And it's a little too easy to mistake the cruise control switch for the turn signal and flash the high beams at innocent motorists. That's about it. Sure, the 3 Series seems overhyped at times, but that's because, simply put, it's a very good car. It combines the desirable elements of an enthusiast's machine with the comfort and ease that make the daily commute, or the endless road trip, endurable, if not downright pleasant.

Curiosity's selfie and other amazing photos from space this week. The Crab Nebula: Observations Through Time This 2018 composite of the Crab Nebula was made with data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (blue and white), Hubble Space Telescope (purple), and Spitzer Space Telescope (pink). The star that exploded to create the Crab Nebula was first seen from Earth in 1054 A.D. Perseverance Field Team Sets up A field team sets up equipment in the Nevada desert in February 2020 as part of a training session for scientists who will work with NASA's Perseverance Mars rover after it lands. Cameras and instruments carried by the field team stood in for an actual rover; the scientists, based in offices around the world, sent commands for images and data, as they will with Perseverance. Spider eyes in space This Z-CAM V1 Pro Cinematic camera, shown to the left of NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, was launched to the Space Station in December 2018. It shoots high quality 360-degree footage, documenting life and research on the Space Station for people to experience in VR on Earth. On station, the camera is used to film up to four hours of footage each week. Every one to two weeks, this footage is transferred from the camera onto solid state drives that are used for storage and downlinking. Approaching Space Station Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo craft approaches the International Space Station delivering about 7,500 pounds of research and supplies to the Expedition 62 crew. NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan would command the Canadarm2 robotic arm to reach out and capture Cygnus after a two-and-half-day trip that began with a launch from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Nearly three months after delivering several tons of supplies and scientific experiments to the International Space Station, Northrup Grumman s unpiloted Cygnus cargo craft is scheduled to depart the International Space Station on Monday, May 11. Launch Complex 39B An aerial view of Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida with Exploration Ground Systems' mobile launcher for the Artemis I mission on the pad. The mobile launcher, atop crawler-transporter 2, made a solo trek from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the surface of pad B in June 2019 for integrated testing. A stretched spiral This sparkling spiral galaxy looks almost stretched across the sky in this image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Known as NGC 4100, the galaxy boasts a neat spiral structure and swirling arms speckled with the bright blue hue of newly formed stars. This image was captured by Hubble s Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This remarkable instrument was installed in 2002, and, with some servicing over the years by intrepid astronauts, is still going strong. Private moon lander On April 30, NASA announced the three companies that will develop, build and fly lunar landers, with the goal of returning astronauts to the moon by 2024. The companies are SpaceX, led by Elon Musk; Blue Origin, founded by Amazon s Jeff Bezos; and Dynetics, a Huntsville subsidiary of Leidos. Jupiter's great red spot Jupiter's already vibrant colors become especially striking in this artistic interpretation of an image from NASA's Juno mission that shows the planet's famous Great Red Spot. This spot is a storm in Jupiter's southern hemisphere with crimson-colored clouds that spin counterclockwise at wind speeds that exceed those in any storm on Earth. The Great Red Spot has slowly changed over the years, and is currently about 1.3 times as wide as our planet. Data returned by the Juno mission helped scientists determine that the storm's roots extend at least 200 miles (320 kilometers) into Jupiter's atmosphere. Crisscrossing bands The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists called "chaos terrain." This newly reprocessed image was taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft on Sept. 26, 1998, and reveal details of diverse surface features on Europa. This image shows a region of Europa's surface covered with ridges and bands, with a few small disrupted chaos regions. The long, linear ridges and bands that crisscross Europa's surface are thought to be related to the response of Europa's icy surface crust as it is stretched and pulled by Jupiter's strong gravity. Giant asteroid fly past Earth This radar image made available by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico shows asteroid 1998 OR2 on April 17. NASA says the large near-Earth asteroid will safely pass by Earth on April 29, providing astronomers with an opportunity to study the 1.5-mile-wide (2-kilometer-wide) object in great detail. Tapestry of blazing starbirth This image is one of the most photogenic examples of the many turbulent stellar nurseries the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has observed during its 30-year lifetime. The portrait features the giant nebula NGC 2014 and its neighbor NGC 2020, which together form part of a vast star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, approximately 163 000 light-years away. 30 Years of the Hubble Space Telescope On April 25, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was deployed from the cargo bay of space shuttle Discovery. Here, Hubble has one of its two solar array panels deployed while still in the grasp of Discovery's remote manipulator system. Mars helicopter Shown in this artist's rendering is the Mars Helicopter, a small, autonomous rotorcraft, will travel with NASA's Mars Perseverance rover, currently scheduled to launch in July 2020, to demonstrate the viability and potential of heavier-than-air vehicles on the Red Planet. Lunar flashlight This artist's concept shows the Lunar Flashlight spacecraft, a six-unit CubeSat designed to search for ice on the Moon's surface using special lasers. The spacecraft will use its near-infrared lasers to shine light into shaded polar regions on the Moon, while an onboard reflectometer will measure surface reflection and composition. Comet breakup These two Hubble Space Telescope images of comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS), taken on April 20 (left) and April 23, 2020, provide the sharpest views yet of the breakup of the solid nucleus of the comet. Down to Earth NASA astronaut Jessica Meir conducted the first-ever all-female spacewalk during her 205 days in space. Alongside NASA astronaut and friend Christina Koch, the women totaled 21 hours and 44 minutes outside the Space Station across three historic spacewalks. Meir is now back down on our planet; she returned with fellow NASA astronaut Drew Morgan and cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka on April 17. Churning texture in Jupiter's atmosphere NASA's Juno mission captured these elaborate atmospheric jets in Jupiter's northern mid-latitude region. This detailed, color-enhanced image reveals a complex topography in Jupiter's cloud tops. If you look closely, relatively small, bright, "pop-up" clouds   which rise above the surrounding features   stand out at the tops and edges of the swirling patterns, while the darker areas nearby reveal greater depth. The spacecraft which took this picture was traveling about 127,000 mph (204,000 kilometers per hour) relative to the planet at that time. Mapping fire near Chernobyl This extract of a burned area mapping product was generated by CIMA Foundation and Fadeout using the WASDI processing environment. It shows the burned area around Chernobyl in Ukraine following an outbreak of wildfires. CIMA Foundation is leading an ESA project called eDRIFT that is looking at Disaster Risk Financing using Cloud processing of Copernicus Sentinel imagery. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations over India These images, using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, show the average nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 1 January to 24 March 2020 and 25 March (the first day of the lockdown) to 20 April 2020   compared to the same time-frame as last year. The significant reduction in the concentrations can be seen over major cities across India. Mumbai and Delhi saw drops of around 40-50% compared to the same time last year. "Aurora Australis" from the International Space Station The "Aurora Australis" hovers above the Earth's horizon as the International Space Station nears the southernmost point of its orbital trek above the Indian Ocean. Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano erupts spewing plumes of ash A handout picture made available by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shows a satellite image of Anak Krakatau volcano as a plume towers over its peak, in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, April 13, 2020. One Step Closer to Touching Asteroid Bennu This artist s concept shows the trajectory and configuration of NASA s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft during Checkpoint rehearsal, which is the first time the mission practiced the initial steps for collecting a sample from asteroid Bennu. Checkpoint: OSIRIS-REx Practices Sample Collection This image shows sample site Nightingale Crater, OSIRIS-REx s primary sample collection site on asteroid Bennu. Rings upon rings A galaxy having so many distinct rings is rare, making NGC 2273 unusual. Galaxy NGC 2273 hosts an inner ring and two outer "pseudorings". 30 percent drop in air pollution over Northeast USA A handout composite picture made available by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shows the average concentration of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide over the major metropolitan areas of the Northeast USA in March of 2015-19 (top) and the average concentration measured in March 2020 (bottom), issued on April 10. Mars Helicopter Aboard Perseverance The Mars Helicopter and its Mars Helicopter Delivery System were attached to the Perseverance Mars rover at Kennedy Space Center on April 6, 2020. Launching the Next Crew to the Space Station The Soyuz MS-16 lifts off from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday, April 9, 2020, sending Expedition 63 crewmembers Chris Cassidy of NASA and Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of Roscosmos into orbit for a six-hour flight to the International Space Station and the start of a six-and-a-half month mission. Habitable planet found hidden in early NASA Kepler data An illustration of Kepler-1649c orbiting around its host red dwarf star. This newly discovered exoplanet is in its star s habitable zone and is the closest to Earth in size and temperature found yet in Kepler's data. What it could look like An illustration of what Kepler-1649c could look like from its surface. Deserted Venetian lagoon Italy s efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease has led to a decrease of boat traffic in Venice s famous waterways   as captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission. These images show one of the effects of the locked-down city of Venice, in northern Italy. The top image, captured on April 13, 2020, shows a distinct lack of boat traffic compared to the image from April 19, 2019. The U.S. Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupply ship The U.S. Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupply ship is featured in this image as the International Space Station orbited above the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Central America. The "aurora australis" above the Indian Ocean The "aurora australis" is pictured near the southernmost point of the International Space Station's orbital trek above the Indian Ocean. Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan is pictured from the International Space Station as it orbited above the western Asian nation. Olympia Undae This VIS image shows part of Olympia Undae, a vast sand sea near the north pole. Spitzer Brown Dwarf Wind (Artist's Concept) This artist's concept shows a brown dwarf, an object that is at least 13 times the mass of Jupiter but not massive enough to begin nuclear fusion in its core, which is the defining characteristic of a star. Scientist using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope recently made the first ever direct measurement of wind on a brown dwarf. A cosmic homicide in action A cosmic homicide in action, with a wayward star being shredded by the intense gravitational pull of a black hole that contains tens of thousands of solar masses in an artist's impression obtained by Reuters on April 2. New view of the Pillars of Creation   infrared Hubble Space Telescope has revisited one of its most iconic and popular images: the Eagle Nebula s Pillars of Creation. This image shows the pillars as seen in infrared light, allowing it to pierce through obscuring dust and gas and unveil a more unfamiliar   but just as amazing   view of the pillars. In this ethereal view the entire frame is peppered with bright stars and baby stars are revealed being formed within the pillars themselves. The ghostly outlines of the pillars seem much more delicate, and are silhouetted against an eerie blue haze. Bepi before space Launched in 2018, the BepiColombo spacecraft was due to make its flyby of Earth April 10, helping it slow down to allow the Sun s gravity to pull it closer to Mercury. This picture comes from 2014, showing its main Mercury Planetary Orbiter module bathed in simulated sunlight during ground testing, to give an idea of how the spacecraft will be illuminated in space as it passes its homeworld. Rosette Nebula Gives Birth to Stars This 2010 image from the Herschel Space Observatory shows dust clouds associated with the Rosette Nebula, a stellar nursery about 5,000 light-years from Earth in the Monoceros, or Unicorn, constellation. Herschel collected the infrared light given out by dust. The bright smudges are dusty cocoons containing massive embryonic stars, which will grow up to 10 times the mass of our Sun. The small spots near the center of the image are lower mass stellar embryos. The nebula itself is located to the right of the picture, along with its massive cluster of stars. Cardiac Research on the Space Station Aboard the International Space Station, NASA astronaut Jessica Meir conducts cardiac research inside the Life Sciences Glovebox, a biology research facility located in Japan's Kibo laboratory module. The Engineered Heart Tissues investigation explores cardiac function in weightlessness, which may provide new drug developments for astronauts and Earthlings. High-Altitude Hazes on Jupiter NASA's Juno mission captured this look at Jupiter's tumultuous northern regions during the spacecraft's close approach to the planet on Feb. 17, 2020. Some notable features in this view are the long, thin bands that run through the center of the image from top to bottom. Juno has observed these long streaks since its first close pass by Jupiter in 2016. The streaks are layers of haze particles that float above the underlying cloud features. Scientists don't yet know exactly what these hazes are made of or how they form. Two jet streams in Jupiter's atmosphere flank either side of the region where the narrow bands of haze typically appear, and some researchers speculate those jet streams may influence the formation of the high hazes. A very large eye exam Surrounded by the gleaming metal of one of ESO's Very Large Telescope s Unit Telescopes, two engineers are carrying out maintenance work on the telescope s complex and delicate optical systems. Similar to human eyes, the eyes of ESO s Paranal Observatory must be constantly checked, maintained and tested in order to continuously provide the very best astronomical images. The huge 8.2-metre Unit Telescope mirrors are housed in protective structures, ensuring that the delicate opto-electronic systems are sheltered from the harsh and dusty desert surroundings. The fine dust particles of the Atacama desert not only lower image quality, but can also have an abrasive effect on the mirror s surface. This means that not only does the mirror have to be cleaned, but it must be periodically recoated too. Feeding Time This remarkable spiral galaxy, known as NGC 4651, may look serene and peaceful as it swirls in the vast, silent emptiness of space, but don't be fooled   it keeps a violent secret. It is believed that this galaxy consumed another smaller galaxy to become the large and beautiful spiral that we observe today. Although only a telescope like the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which captured this image, could give us a picture this clear, NGC 4651 can also be observed with an amateur telescope   so if you have a telescope at home and a star-gazing eye, look out for this glittering carnivorous spiral. Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover Wheels Wheels are installed on NASA s Mars Perseverance rover inside Kennedy Space Center s Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility on March 30, 2020. Perseverance will liftoff aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 541 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in July 2020. NASA s Launch Services Program based at Kennedy is managing the launch. The rover will land on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. A waxing gibbous Moon above the Earth A waxing gibbous Moon is pictured from the International Space Station as it orbited above North America. Bartolomeo connected to Columbus The first European external commercial facility on the International Space Station arrived at its new home last week: the Columbus laboratory module. Bartolomeo, named after the younger brother of Christopher Columbus, was installed by robotic arm on the forward-facing side of the space laboratory on 2 April 2020. Bartolomeo is built and operated by Airbus, and hosted by ESA on the International Space Station. The facility has a clear view of Earth and the service benefits from high-speed data transfer to provide easy access to space at competitive prices Astronauts will perform another spacewalk to install Bartolomeo in the next few months, together with a new terminal called ColKa that will upgrade the European space laboratory. Klotho and Lina Appearing as strings of orange dots, the brightest sets of dots belong to asteroids Klotho and Lina. Both orbit out in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Space program in progress A photo of the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope after a successful deployment test of its primary mirror into the same configuration it will have when in space. The iconic 6.5 meter wide mirror, consisting of a honeycomb-like pattern of 18 hexagonal, gold-coated mirror segments, will be unfolded as part of a complex deployment sequence once the observatory is in space and about to reach its operational orbit. Locating a black hole This Hubble Space Telescope image identified the location of an intermediate-mass black hole, weighing 50,000 times the mass of our Sun (making it much smaller than supermassive black holes found in the centers of galaxies). The black hole, named 3XMM J215022.4−055108, is indicated by the white circle. Seasons on Mars The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter snapped this series of false-color pictures of sand dunes in the north polar region of Mars. The area covered in each of the five panels is about 0.8 mile (1.3 kilometers) wide. The progression begins at left (Panel A) in early spring, when the ground is covered by a seasonal layer of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) about 2 feet thick. As spring progresses the ice cracks (Panel B), releasing dark sand from the dune below. When pressurized gas trapped below the ice layer is released, it carries along sand and dust to the top of the ice layer, where it is dropped in fan-shaped deposits downhill and downwind (panels C and D). The final panel shows more and more of the dark dunes as the overlying layer of seasonal ice evaporates back into the atmosphere. Perseverance Mars Rover A placard commemorating NASA's "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign was installed on the Perseverance Mars rover on March 16, 2020, at Kennedy Space Center. Three silicon chips (upper left corner) were stenciled with 10,932,295 names and the essays from 155 finalists in NASA's "Name the Rover" contest. Icy-cold Uranus Voyager 2 took this image as it approached the planet Uranus on Jan. 14, 1986. The planet s hazy bluish color is due to the methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light. Voyager 2 flew within 50,600 miles (81,433 kilometers) of Uranus  cloud tops, collecting data that revealed two new rings, 11 new moons and temperatures below minus 353 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 214 degrees Celsius). The dataset is still the only up-close measurements we have ever made of the planet. Solar particle storms A new NASA mission called SunRISE will study what drives solar particle storms   giant surges of solar particles that erupt off of the Sun   as depicted in this illustration. Understanding how such storms affect interplanetary space can help protect spacecraft and astronauts. NASA chose SunRISE in August 2017 as one of two Mission of Opportunity proposals to conduct an 11-month mission concept study. In February 2019, the agency approved a continued formulation study of the mission for an additional year. SunRISE is led by Justin Kasper at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and managed by NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. SpaceX Dragon XL Illustration of the SpaceX Dragon XL as it is deployed from the Falcon Heavy's second stage in high Earth orbit on its way to the Gateway in lunar orbit. NASA has selected SpaceX of Hawthorne, as the first U.S. commercial provider under the Gateway Logistics Services contract to deliver cargo, experiments and other supplies to the agency s Gateway in lunar orbit. The award is a significant step forward for NASA s Artemis program that will land the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024 and build a sustainable human lunar presence. A massive laboratory This image shows a region of space called LHA 120-N150. It is a substructure of the gigantic Tarantula Nebula. The latter is the largest known stellar nursery in the local Universe. The nebula is situated more than 160 000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring dwarf irregular galaxy that orbits the Milky Way. Hubble hooks a one-arm galaxy Located about 21 million light-years from our galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici, NGC 4618 has a diameter of about one-third that of our Milky Way. Together with its neighbor, NGC 4625, it forms an interacting galaxy pair, which means that the two galaxies are close enough to influence each other gravitationally. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations over France These images, using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, show the average nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 14 to 25 March 2020, compared to the monthly average concentrations from 2019. Orion spacecraft The Orion spacecraft, secured atop a transporter in its shipping container, is carried to the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at NASA s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on March 25, 2020. The spacecraft was transported to Kennedy in NASA s Super Guppy aircraft from the agency s Plum Brook Station in Ohio. Sent to Ohio in fall 2019 for environmental testing, Orion is now ready to undergo final testing and assembly, after which it will be integrated with the Space Launch System rocket. Orion will fly on the agency s Artemis I mission   the first in a series of increasingly complex missions to the Moon that will ultimately lead to the exploration of Mars. Soyuz-2 takes off In this handout photo released by Roscosmos Space Agency Press Service, a Soyuz-2.1b launch vehicle takes-off with another 34 OneWeb satellites from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, on March 21. Astronaut Christina Koch services a 3-D biological printer In this image taken in December 2019 and released March 24, 2020, astronaut Christina Koch handles media bags that enable the manufacturing of organ-like tissues using the BioFabrication Facility (BFF), a 3-D biological printer on the International Space Station. The BFF could become a part of a larger system capable of manufacturing whole, fully functioning human organs from existing patient cells in microgravity. Tracking warming NASA s new three-dimensional portrait of methane, the world s second-largest contributor to greenhouse warming, shows it arising from a diversity of sources on the ground and how it moves through the atmosphere. Combining multiple data sets from emissions inventories, including fossil fuel, agricultural, biomass burning and biofuels, and simulations of wetland sources into a high-resolution computer model, researchers now have an additional tool for understanding this complex gas and its role in Earth s carbon cycle, atmospheric composition, and climate system. Tarantula Nebula This ground-based view of the Tarantula Nebula shows the nebula in its entirety. It is the brightest region of star formation in the local Universe. Hubble s field of view covers just a tiny spot in the upper-right quadrant of this image, though it reveals detail invisible here, including a supernova remnant. Cosmos in motion The entire Universe is constantly on the move, from individual atoms all the way up to massive galaxy clusters. This is beautifully showcased in an image such as this, taken from the Chajnantor plateau some 5,000 meters up in the Chilean Atacama Desert. This extremely arid and remote environment is home to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the largest telescope array in existence. The blurred object is a specialized transporter, caught in the act of carefully carrying one of ALMA s 66 high-precision antennas to a specific position on the plateau. By arranging the antennas in more extended configurations, astronomers can obtain far more highly spatially resolved images (meaning that the image is more detailed), while more compact configurations give better sensitivity for sources which spread over more of the sky. Uranus' Magnetic Field An animated image showing Uranus' magnetic field. The yellow arrow points to the Sun, the light blue arrow marks Uranus' magnetic axis, and the dark blue arrow marks Uranus' rotation axis. Chandra Data Tests 'Theory of Everything' Astronomers using NASA s Chandra X-ray Observatory have now made a significant step forward in understanding string theory. By searching through galaxy clusters, the largest structures in the universe held together by gravity, researchers were able to hunt for a specific particle that many models of string theory predict should exist. While the resulting non-detection does not rule out string theory altogether, it does deliver a blow to certain models within that family of ideas.  Until recently I had no idea just how much X-ray astronomers bring to the table when it comes to string theory, but we could play a major role,  said Christopher Reynolds of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, who led the study.  If these particles are eventually detected it would change physics forever.  The particle that Reynolds and his colleagues were searching for is called an  axion.  These as-yet-undetected particles should have extraordinarily low masses. Scientists do not know the precise mass range, but many theories feature axion masses ranging from about a millionth of the mass of an electron down to zero mass. Some scientists think that axions could explain the mystery of dark matter, which accounts for the vast majority of matter in the universe. Curiosity at the Hutton Drill Site This selfie was taken by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover on Feb. 26. The crumbling rock layer at the top of the image is the Greenheugh Pediment, which Curiosity climbed soon after taking the image. 20, 2020. Fluffy-Looking Galaxy An image shows the galaxy NGC 4237. Located about 60 million light years from Earth in the constellation of Coma Berenices (Berenice's Hair), NGC 4237 is classified as a flocculent spiral galaxy. This means that its spiral arms are not clearly distinguishable from each other, as in grand design spiral galaxies, but are instead patchy and discontinuous. This gives the galaxy a fluffy appearance, somewhat resembling cotton wool. Astronomers studying NGC 4237 were actually more interested in its galactic bulge   its bright central region. By learning more about these bulges, we can explore how spiral galaxies have evolved, and study the growth of the supermassive black holes that lurk at the centres of most spirals. Navcam Movie of How Curiosity Takes a Selfie This video, taken by the Navigation Cameras, or Navcams, on the Mast of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover, shows the rover's robotic arm as it rotates to take a selfie. A camera at the end of the arm captured 86 individual images that were later stitched into a panorama. The Navcams are black-and-white cameras generally used to help engineers plan Curiosity's movements. City Lights The International Space Station orbits above Malaysia and Indonesia, on March 21. Science at Work NASA astronaut Jessica Meir works on the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) for the Advanced Colloids Experiment-Temperature-4 (ACE-T-4) science in the Destiny module aboard the International Space Station (ISS), introducing disorder to a crystalline system in a controlled way can form glass. Advanced Colloids Experiment-Temperature-4 (ACE-T-4) examines the transition of an ordered crystal to a disordered glass to determine how increasing disorder affects structural and dynamic properties. Bennu in Unprecedented Detail This global map of asteroid Bennu's surface is a mosaic of images collected by NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft between Mar. 7 and Apr. 19, 2019. A total of 2,155 PolyCam images were stitched together and corrected to produce the mosaic. At 2 inches (5 cm) per pixel, this is the highest resolution at which a planetary body has been globally mapped. The spacecraft collected these images at distances ranging from 1.9 to 3.1 miles (3.1 to 5 km) above the asteroid's surface. This detailed view of Bennu was used by the mission team during their selection of the primary and backup sample collection sites   Nightingale and Osprey. Image released on March 19, 2020. Hunger pangs The subject in this picture, a spiral galaxy named NGC 1589, was once the scene of a violent bout of cosmic hunger pangs; as astronomers looked on, a poor, hapless star was torn apart and devoured by the ravenous supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. The astronomers are now using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to test this interpretation. Hubble has observed such events before so the scientists are confident that Hubble will be able to provide smoking gun evidence in the form of stellar debris that was ejected during the disruption event. Full moon A full moon seen from the International Space Station as it orbits 251 miles above the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, territories of India in the Bay of Bengal. Off goes the falcon A Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket with a payload of approximately 60 satellites for SpaceX's Starlink broadband network lifts off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on March 18. Fluctuating levels A combination of two animated images show the fluctuation of nitrogen dioxide emissions across Europe from January 2020 until March 11. New data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite reveal the decline of air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide emissions, over Italy. This reduction is particularly visible in northern Italy which coincides with its nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, in this handout obtained on March 13.
AA2gs73	health	medical	11 reasons you should never, ever take a cruise	A cruise vacation may seem like a great way to relax, but it just might cost you your health.	A cruise vacation may seem like a great way to relax, but it just might cost you your health. Dangers at sea Summer is over, winter isn't yet here, and there's no better time for a refreshing and relaxing cruise. Let the kids enjoy rock climbing, surfing, zip lining, ice skating and swimming while you savor crisp blue skies, warm sea mists and wine coolers on your balcony as you cuddle together and scan the whitecaps for a glimpse of an acrobatic whale. A lush buffet dinner awaits you all in a couple of hours; until then, there are many options for fun on your personal vacation menu. Unfortunately, although a cruise ship may seem like a getaway from daily life and its stressors, potential dangers lurk in every passageway and on every promenade. Dangerous fellow passengers "People assume that a cruise ship is a safe cocoon and get a sense of overconfidence," says Charles Lipcon, a cruise-line maritime attorney in Miami and author of "Unsafe on the High Seas." "Their 'antennas' get turned off. But a cruise ship is like a big city. Would you let your 15-year-old run around New York City alone at 2 a.m.?" Lipcon's cases have included gang rapes of young girls and date-rape drug use. Reported sexual assaults on ships number in the dozens each year, and poorly trained or unqualified cruise-line security guards are often the only investigators after a crime has occurred. "Passengers think they're in the United States, but they're in the country of the vessel's flag and under that country's laws," Lipcon adds. The FBI does have jurisdiction over crimes upon American citizens "on the high seas," but it often has no evidence to work with. Cruise-line personnel, Lipcon says, typically "make no effort to preserve the crime scene. They vacuum the room and steam-clean the sheets." The result: Many perpetrators remain unidentified   and unprosecuted. Unhealthy eating and drinking Taking precautions is important to stay safe on a cruise   but also to stay healthy. "But health-conscious travelers face an environment filled with excess," says Ellen Bauersfeld, a registered dietitian in Northridge, Calif. "24/7 meals, hundreds of items on a buffet line   most of which are high in fat, salt and sugar. Even with good intentions, many fall prey to overeating. "Unhealthy foods trigger addictive changes in brain chemistry, Bauersfeld explains, adding: "Recent research has revealed the dopamine spike that sugar creates in our brains. Dopamine is a feel-good hormone that affects our reward/pleasure center a little like a drug. Unfortunately, it only feels good while we're eating, which is why   as David Kessler, M.D., reported in his book, "The End of Overeating"   we want more and more and more." Additionally, Bauersfeld warns, "Mixed specialty drinks are in abundance on cruise ships. Not only are they high in calories, but, after a few drinks, impulse control and making good food choices become more challenging." Food poisoning and norovirus The Centers for Disease Control estimates that food poisoning affects about one in six Americans each year. "Symptoms of food poisoning include fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea," says Dr. Samia Boctor, who has a certification in travelers' health from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. "If travelers consume contaminated food or water or touch surfaces contaminated by fecal material or vomitus, they can get infections with salmonella, shigella or E. coli. And norovirus needs special mention. These strains cause severe outbreaks that can send travelers to the hospital." According to the CDC, more than 90 percent of outbreaks of diarrhea on cruise ships are caused by norovirus. In 2014, nine norovirus outbreaks were reported through the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program. "Norovirus is easily spread, especially in crowded environments," Boctor warns, "even by sharing food or eating utensils with someone who is ill." Mechanical difficulties and their consequences Mechanical difficulties and fires on cruise ships have made headlines; thousands of passengers have been stranded for hours or even days at sea, often without power to support effective refrigeration, food preparation or sewage disposal. Backed-up toilets and leaking human waste can easily spread infections such as E. coli or norovirus. "Because of multiple routes of transmission, it is difficult to contain outbreaks," Boctor says. To reduce the risk of infections, Boctor advises that "special attention should be taken while removing vomitus and fecal material; surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected, and cleaners should be wearing protective equipment including, gloves, masks and gowns." Norovirus can be resistant to common disinfectants. The CDC recommends that cruise-ship passengers wash their hands with anti-bacterial soap after using the toilet and before eating or drinking, in order to prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses. Unqualified doctors The ship's infirmary may be staffed by an earnest health-care provider in a starched white coat, but there's no guarantee that the "doctor" on duty is licensed to practice medicine in the United States   or anywhere at all. "Historically, doctors were signed up to work for three to six months at a time, paid a salary and part of the proceeds of what was sold in the ships' infirmaries," attorney Lipcon says, "and they could be licensed anywhere, including in the country of the ship's flag. The cruise line is not responsible for bad medical care as long as they hire a qualified physician." Lipcon has even seen cases where the ship's doctor didn't have a license but was "just a graduate of a medical school in the Dominican Republic." Too much fun in the sun We've all heard that it's important to wear sunscreen outdoors, especially during the peak sunlight hours between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Dr. Ramin Ram of Beverly Hills, Calif., a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, says: "UV rays are what cause skin damage and burning, not the sun's heat. Unfortunately, you're exposed to UV rays even during cloudy and cooler days. Sunburns are associated with higher risks of melanoma, which can be fatal if not detected and treated in its early stages." Diving into the pool doesn't protect you. "Although a cold pool or seawater may soothe the skin," Ram says, "its ability to reflect the UV radiation can even double the initial amount of direct UV light your skin receives. It gets worse when you are near sandy beaches, since the sand also may reflect UV light, even while you are under the water." Ram suggests "aggressive and generous applications of water-resistant sunblock reapplied every two hours and after the skin gets wet." Ram also recommends wearing clothing with SPF protection "while you are in the water, which may significantly decrease your exposure to the UV light." Cruises rock   and roll Cruises may be pleasant when the weather cooperates, but a quiet sea voyage can quickly turn into a nightmare when a ship is battered by a storm. Ross Klein, a professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland and publisher of the website CruiseJunkie.com, cites multiple reports of winds over 50 knots causing ships to buck and list. Damage reported includes separation of ship panels, destruction of balcony railings and tossing of heavy furniture such as tables and TV sets across cabins and larger rooms or decks, making injuries more likely. Rough weather also can make passengers seasick, with nausea, vomiting and dizziness. "If you get seasick, talk to your doctor before your trip about ways to prevent symptoms," Boctor says. "There are over-the-counter and prescription medicines that might help you, though most can make you sleepy and you shouldn't use them if you're drinking alcohol." Your bed might bug you Retreating to your bed is always an option if you're under the weather. But uncomfortable mattresses are among the top five cruise complaints, Lipcon reports. Even worse, unwanted guests in your bed, such as bedbugs, can ruin your trip at sea   and can follow you home. Bedbugs are insect parasites that can grow to a quarter-inch long, hide during the day near sleeping areas in mattress seams, bedframes and headboards, and are found even in clean and luxurious environments. "Bedbugs don't transmit disease," Boctor says, "but their bites can cause discomfort, irritation and allergic reactions that can lead to itching, excessive scratching and skin infections   and disrupted sleep." Nothing to sneeze at Allergic reactions can also be triggered by dust and mold. Mold microorganisms and fungi grow in moist environments and on wet surfaces. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, molds produce substances that can commonly cause allergic reactions, as well as irritants and toxins. Allergy symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, skin rashes and asthma attacks. Allergic individuals may also react to dust mites and to fabrics and other components of pillows and mattresses. Avoiding these allergens is the best way to prevent symptoms, but antihistamines and prescription medications may reduce symptoms if environmental controls are not possible. Mental health challenges Cruises are filled with social activities in a party atmosphere, but not everyone feels like the life of the party. "Even in the confined space of a cruise ship, surrounded by people determined to connect and have fun, a passenger might still feel lonely, isolated and downhearted," says clinical psychologist Anthony Johnson. "We constantly compare ourselves. A downhearted person might conclude, 'I can't talk to people. I can't even have fun. I'm not like others. I can't do anything right. Why go on?'" Mental health challenges such as depression can be exacerbated by loneliness and social isolation aboard ship, as well as by the absence of counseling resources and social safety nets. Klein's CruiseJunkie.com reports that 22 cruise-ship passengers went overboard in 2014   including a number of alleged or observed suicides. How to have a happy, healthy cruise As an experienced maritime attorney, Lipcon has dealt with many cases of accidents, sexual assaults, missing people and infections, but he acknowledges that 12 million people take cruises every year and that, fortunately, most have a wonderful time. "Cruise Junkie" Klein concurs, advising cautious travelers to "treat a cruise ship as any large city. Don't assume safety and security. Wash your hands frequently, avoid uncooked and undercooked foods if possible, and take caution with drinking water. Use bottled water if you want to be entirely safe." Other tips for a safe cruise, Klein says, include having all of your prescription medications with you, and enough for the entire cruise. "Also, be prepared to give a medical history in case there is [an] emergency requiring medical intervention. Have your medical insurance information with you; buying trip medical insurance is a good idea." Bring sun block and use it, and don't forget to drink lots of water … and avoid overindulgence of alcohol, and of fatty and high-caloric foods; the average passenger gains seven pounds or more on a one-week cruise."The best advice for sea travelers, Lipcon adds: "Don't leave your common sense behind when you board."

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.] Real estate stocks have become a popular income investment vehicle. Most operate as real estate investment trusts (REITs). \ These REITs are supposed to pay at least 90% of their income in the form of dividends . In exchange, REIT do not have to pay income tax on the net income generated from their properties. For this reason, REITs tend to pay higher dividends than most stocks, and some of them can sustain very high payouts for several years. This occurs even as lifestyle changes and technology affect the demand for and use of properties. 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy In our dynamic economy, these five real estate stocks have maintained strong, steady dividends amid the changes, Consequently, I believe they are good stocks to buy Kite Realty (KRG) At first glance, Kite Realty (NYSE: KRG ) may seem like a strange name to include on a list of real estate stocks to buy. In an overbuilt retail real estate market, many investors want to avoid the retail REIT sector in which KRG operates. However, investors need to remember that brick-and-mortar retail is not dying, it is merely shrinking. Hence, prospective buyers should not necessarily avoid these stocks. Amid the abandoned malls across the landscape, retail REITs such as KRG stock have found a way to thrive. Retail REITs may look scary right now, but even in this depressed retail real estate market, KRG stock can still offer generous dividend yields at a reasonable price, so it definitely deserves to be included on a list of real estate stocks to buy for dividend income. Kite Realty has the good fortune (or good business sense) of owning property mostly in high-growth markets. Even in an overbuilt market, KRG maintains high occupancy and lease rates. Moreover, it is reshuffling its portfolio to increase this geographic focus. This has led to increased buying among insiders and hedge funds. But the retail market is taking an absolute beating right now, depressing the KRG share price. That said, KRG is still a solid bet as the reopening begins. In the meantime, it's paying out more than 13% in dividends. Omega Healthcare (OHI) Omega Healthcare (NYSE: OHI ) is an equity REIT specializing in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities across the U.S. and U.K. T he company operates under a "triple-net" arrangement, meaning the lessor takes responsibility for taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Thanks to the aging of the baby boom generation, around 10,000 people per day age into the Medicare system. Hence, demographics serve as the growth engine for this and many real estate stocks of this type. The peak of the baby boom occurred in 1957, meaning this trend should peak in 2022. However, I think this growth should remain strong until 2029 when the last of the baby boom generation reaches age 65. 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades The dividend has enjoyed a steady growth trend since 2003. Today, the company pays an annual dividend of $2.68 per share. This takes the yield to 9.09%. Unlike many REITs, OHI stock may bring some stock price growth. The P/E stands at 26.6. This may seem high for a REIT. However, analysts forecast an average growth rate of 15.8% per year over the next five years. For this reason, both the dividend and the price of OHI stock should move higher over the next few years. Like with all healthcare REITs, I think investors need to stay mindful of demographics. However, as long as baby boomers keep aging into Medicare, I believe OHI will continue to prosper, justifying its inclusion on this list of real estate stocks to buy for dividend income. Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) Diversified Healthcare Trust (NYSE: DHC ) operates 443 properties spread across 42 states and Washington, D.C. These consist of medical facilities, wellness centers, and communities for senior living spread across the United States. After changing its name and focus (it was formerly Senior Housing Properties Trust ) at the beginning of this year. If history serves as an indication, I would expect little price appreciation. However, for those who want a high dividend that should hold up for most of the next decade, SNH stock will serve that purpose well, making it one of the top five real estate stocks to buy for dividend income. STAG Industrial (STAG) STAG Industrial (NYSE: STAG ) buys and operates single-tenant industrial properties across the United States. It owns 76.8 million sq. feet of space spread across 390 properties in 37 states. STAG stock and other industrial real estate stocks have benefited from an unexpected source of revenue over the last few years -- e-commerce. As more retail business moves online, a large portion of retail real estate activity has moved into warehouses. Thanks to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and other e-retailers, industrial space has rented as a premium. This premium has gone into profits, and by extension, dividends. Investors now receive $1.43 per share annually, a yield of 5.68%. Best of all, payouts come in the form of monthly dividends that have grown steadily over time. Moreover, the dividend should become a more critical component of STAG stock as growth slows down. After seeing an average 65% annual growth rate in the previous five years, analysts forecast growth of only 7% per year for the next five years. As a result, the stock has almost tripled since its low in 2011. I would expect with slower growth, the move higher should stop. 7 Beautiful Biotech Stocks to Buy Here Still, blurring the line between industrial and retail properties has permanently changed the industry for STAG. The business created by eCommerce will not go away. Even if growth in the STAG stock price slows, expect the equity to maintain its stable, high-yielding monthly dividend, making it a top real estate stock to buy for dividend income. Vereit (VER) Vereit (NYSE: VER ) is one of the few equity real estate stocks that does not limit itself to one property type. This diversified REIT owns and operates industrial, office, restaurant, and retail properties across the country. Its portfolio consists of 95 million square feet spread across approximately 4,000 properties. The REIT owns buildings in 49 U.S. states as well as Puerto Rico. The dividend has delivered stability and steady increases over the same time frame. Right now, VER pays an annual dividend of $1.43 per share. That comes to a yield of about 10.43%, since the recent crash. Though the company does not increase the dividend annually, it did hike the quarterly payout in 2018 and 2015, the year it switched from monthly to quarterly dividends. Time will tell whether the VER stock price continues its move higher. Still, with a diversified real estate portfolio and steady, high-yield dividends, income investors should do well in Vereit regardless of the price action, so it's definitely one of the top five real estate stocks to buy for dividend income.

AAsesZq	autos	autosnews	2018 Cadillac XT5: What You Need to Know	In a very competitive class, the 2018 Cadillac XT5 is unremarkable in most ways. It has an upscale interior and a comfortable ride, but its rivals are better overall. One major advantage to the XT5 is that it has one of the lowest prices in the class.	In a very competitive class, the 2018 Cadillac XT5 is unremarkable in most ways. It has an upscale interior and a comfortable ride, but its rivals are better overall. One major advantage to the XT5 is that it has one of the lowest prices in the class. Is the Cadillac XT5 a Good SUV? Despite ranking lower than many luxury midsize SUVs , the 2018 Cadillac is still a good SUV. However, when describing it line by line, there are many "buts." For example, the XT5's cabin is comfortable and has many luxury touches, but it's not as spacious or quiet as some rivals are. On paper, the engine also has a decent amount of power, but that doesn't translate into strong acceleration in practice. Should I Buy the Cadillac XT5? You should buy the Cadillac XT5 if you want a quality luxury SUV that costs less than most of the competition. The XT5's sticker price of just over $40,000 is one of the lowest in the class. However, it doesn't shortchange you on standard features or interior quality. The cabin is sophisticated and high-class, with standard features like Apple CarPlay, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and wireless charging for smartphones. Performance focuses on comfort rather than thrills. The XT5 has a composed ride and adequate acceleration. Still, this is a tough class to compete in, and the XT5 doesn't really stand out enough from its competitors. It gives you good bang for your buck, with a starting price that is significantly less than the BMW X5 , Audi Q7 , and other higher-ranked rivals. Like the XT5, the Lincoln MKX offers good value with an even lower starting price. Should I Buy a New or Used Cadillac XT5? Cadillac introduced the XT5 for the 2017 model year. The 2018 model is virtually identical to the debut model, meaning that shoppers can potentially save some money by buying used. If you're interested in a used model, be sure to visit our overview of the 2017 Cadillac XT5 . Also, check out our Used Car Deals page to learn about savings and discounts on used vehicles. We Did the Research for You: 30 Reviews Analyzed We analyzed 30 Cadillac XT5 reviews   along with safety and reliability ratings, fuel economy estimates, and more   to help you decide if the 2018 XT5 is the right new car for you. This review includes applicable data and research from every model year since the XT5's debut, which includes the 2017 and 2018 model years. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News & World Report has been ranking and reviewing cars, trucks, and SUVs since 2007, and our editorial team has more than 75 years of combined experience in the auto industry. To ensure our reviews are unbiased, we don't accept expensive gifts or incentives from car companies, and a third party handles our advertising. How Much Does the Cadillac XT5 Cost? Prices for the 2018 XT5 start at $40,595. In addition to the base model, this SUV comes in three other trim levels: Luxury ($46,595), Premium Luxury ($53,095), and Platinum ($63,395). The XT5 Platinum comes standard with all-wheel drive. All other models are front-wheel drive, with the option to upgrade to all-wheel drive ($2,500 to $3,000). For great savings at your local Cadillac dealer, check out our U.S. News Best Price Program . You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Cadillac deals page . Cadillac XT5 Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Cadillac XT5 or BMW X5? The BMW X5 is one of the best SUVs in the class, but it's a lot more utilitarian than the Cadillac XT5. The BMW offers several extra cubic feet of cargo room in its 2-row version. With the optional third row, it can carry up to seven people. Its performance is quintessential BMW, with roaring engine options and deft handling. However, the BMW costs a lot more than the Cadillac. Which Is Better: Cadillac XT5 or Audi Q7? The Audi Q7 tops the XT5 in almost every way. The Q7 is fun to drive and has a serene ride. It features a top-notch cabin with an impressive amount of standard safety equipment. Audi's largest SUV has standard seating for seven, making it a good choice if you need to ferry a lot of passengers around. It has a higher price than the XT5, but the difference isn't as steep as with some other luxury midsize SUVs . Which Is Better: Cadillac XT5 or Lincoln MKX? The Lincoln MKX is the only class rival to undercut the XT5 in price (by about $1,500). If you're shopping on a tighter budget, the MKX is a good alternative. The Lincoln has lively engine choices, more cargo space, and great crash test scores. XT5 Interior How Many People Does the XT5 Seat? The XT5 comes with synthetic leather upholstery, two rows of seats, and room for five people. Both rows of seats provide a decent amount of comfort, and those riding in the rear will enjoy seats that slide and recline, as well as two back-seat USB ports. The passenger space isn't as stellar as what you'll find in some other Cadillacs, though the complaints are trifling. Some test drivers note that the seats aren't as roomy nor the ride as cushy as you might expect from a luxury vehicle. XT5 and Car Seats In the back seat, the XT5 has three tether anchors (one for each seat) and two sets of lower anchors (on the outboard seats only). These get an intermediate grade   most hardware is easy to find and use, but the lower anchors behind the driver's seat are mounted deep in the seat cushions, and the tether anchors could be confused with other hardware. XT5 Interior Quality The XT5's cabin design leans toward stately and subdued, with high-quality materials nearly everywhere you look. Like many luxury models, there's a noticeable difference between trim levels. As elegant as the entry-level model is, the Platinum edition is clearly the standout, with material choices that fall on the supremely opulent side of the scale. The drawback is that pricing for this trim starts at nearly $63,000   a roughly $20,000 increase over the base XT5. XT5 Cargo Space The XT5's cargo space is about average compared to other 2-row luxury SUVs , but it's very convenient. If you need a little more room in the back but also have rear-seat passengers, you can slide the second-row seats forward to add a few extra inches to your cargo hold. These seats also create a flat floor when you fold them. Every XT5 comes with a power liftgate, but if you find yourself frequently laden with armloads of stuff, consider upgrading to the hands-free liftgate. XT5 Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation For the most part, the XT5's technology gets a thumbs up. The menu layout of its CUE infotainment system is easy to use and comes packed full of extra tidbits that tech-savvy drivers will relish. In addition to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (which link many of your smartphone apps to the car's display screen), the XT5 comes with four USB ports, wireless charging for your smartphone, and a built-in Wi-Fi hot spot. It comes standard with an eight-speaker Bose stereo system, and you can upgrade to a surround-sound system with 14 speakers. The infotainment interface isn't perfect, with hiccups that include a sliding volume bar placed where it can be accidentally adjusted. For more information, read What Is Apple CarPlay? and What Is Android Auto? Then, see the Best Cars With Apple CarPlay and Best Cars With Android Auto . XT5 Performance XT5 Engine: A Polished Cruiser With its discreet exhaust, smooth shifts, and capable engine, the XT5 is an excellent vessel for your road trip. Its refined powertrain   which includes a 3.6-liter V6 engine and an eight-speed automatic transmission   is most at home cruising on the highway, and many commuters will be perfectly at ease with its performance. Spirited drivers comparing this Cadillac to stablemates like the CT6 or competitors like the BMW X5 will frown upon the XT5's more leisurely acceleration. XT5 Gas Mileage: A Little Better Than Most Though it offers less oomph than some rival V8-powered SUVs, one advantage to the XT5's V6 is fuel economy. It has an EPA rating of 19 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway. Aiding this rating are standard technologies like cylinder deactivation and a stop-start system. XT5 Ride and Handling: Predictable and Smooth If you're the type of driver who wants a vehicle to feel surefooted and refined, but you don't care much about sportiness, then this is a good SUV for you. The ride is comfortable, it feels stable in turns and on coarse pavement, and you'll have plenty of confidence in the braking and steering. Most trim levels come standard with front-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive is available. XT5 Reliability Is the Cadillac XT5 Reliable? The 2018 XT5 has a predicted reliability rating of three out of five from J.D. Power. This is an average rating for all cars Cadillac XT5 Warranty Cadillac covers the 2018 XT5 with a four-year/50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a six-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. XT5 Safety XT5 Crash Test Results The front-wheel-drive 2018 XT5 crossover has an overall rating of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, while all-wheel-drive versions earn a five-star overall rating. Both models receive four stars in the NHTSA frontal crash and rollover tests, and five stars in the side crash test. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the 2018 XT5 top grades in every crash simulation. XT5 Safety Features A rearview camera and rear parking sensors are standard in every XT5. Available safety features include front parking sensors, rear cross traffic alert, a safety alert seat, forward collision alert, a following distance indicator, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, forward and reverse automatic braking, front pedestrian braking, Intellibeam (Cadillac's name for automatic high beams), a rear-camera mirror, a surround-vision camera, a head-up display, adaptive cruise control, and active park assist. Which Cadillac XT5 Model Is Right for Me? The XT5 comes in four trim levels (XT5, Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Platinum), with prices ranging from $40,595 to $63,395. Only one powertrain is available   a 3.6-liter V6 engine mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission   but you have your choice between front-wheel and all-wheel drive in almost every edition. As you move up in price, Cadillac bestows the XT5 with increasing levels of opulence. We detail the notable features of each trim level below. The base model comes well-outfitted with a nice array of amenities, but if you want to add any advanced safety features or luxuries, you'll need to step up to at least the XT5 Luxury; no packages are available with the base model. For the XT5 Luxury trim, we recommend adding the Driver Awareness package. For $770, this bundle includes seven advanced driver assistance features, such as a following-distance indicator, forward collision alert, and front pedestrian braking. Cadillac XT5 The XT5 ($40,595) comes standard with synthetic leather seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch screen, the CUE infotainment system with voice recognition, an eight-speaker Bose audio system, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, wireless charging for mobile devices, four USB ports, a rearview camera, remote start, and a 4G LTE connection with a built-in Wi-Fi hot spot. All-wheel drive is available for $3,000. Cadillac XT5 Luxury Leather seats come standard in the $46,595 Cadillac XT5 Luxury, as does a panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, front and rear parking sensors, and rear cross traffic alert. For $2,500, you can upgrade to all-wheel drive. Cadillac XT5 Premium Luxury Standard features in the Premium Luxury trim include navigation, ventilated front seats, heated rear-outboard seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, a safety alert seat, forward collision alert, a following distance indicator, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, low-speed forward automatic braking, front pedestrian braking, and Intellibeam (Cadillac's name for automatic high beams). Pricing starts at $53,095 with front-wheel drive and $55,595 with all-wheel drive. Cadillac XT5 Platinum The range-topping XT5 Platinum ($63,395) is an all-wheel-drive-only trim. In addition to the standard features from lower trims, it includes a rear-camera mirror, a surround-vision camera, a head-up display, and a hands-free liftgate. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Cadillac dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Cadillac deals page .

Read on to check out the winners for our entry-level fullsize luxury sedan comparison, brought to you by the automotive experts at Motor Trend.	As these words are pecked out, the American economy is barely turning over with the slow wuhn-wuhn-wuhn of an 11-year-old DieHard after a three-week cold-soak at the Minneapolis airport. But last November, we threw a bunch of those 'hopey-changey' bums out, and the lame-duck 2010 Congress has set the trickle-down wheels in motion by extending the Bush tax cuts for all. So surely any day now, our economic engine will be ticking over smoothly, and all you business owners and top-bracket investors who have been hoarding your cash will be spreading it around, right? We hear the extension saves you rich folks $103,835 per million of annual taxable income. What better economic stimulus for you to spend it on than a shiny replacement for that tired old barge you've been driving since the credit-party music stopped. But which flagship to choose? Restraint is still called for. Pop for a V-12 and your Tea Party pals will tsk disapprovingly at your liberal-elite profligacy. Better to demonstrate some "shared sacrifice": Order the entry-level powertrain and go easy on the options. Then, if cap-and-trade sends energy prices through the ozone hole, you can brag about your forward-thinking choice of a thrifty V-6, hybrid, or small, naturally aspirated V-8. The obvious entry-level choices begin with the perennial benchmark Mercedes-Benz, whose S400 Hybrid promises to peg the smugometer. Its 3.5-liter V-6 is augmented by a 118-pound-foot electric motor and lithium-ion battery pack that allows this leviathan limo to sip premium at the penurious rate of just 19 mpg city/26 highway. BMW's 740i goes all EcoBoost-y by using a turbocharged inline-six. Audi will eventually offer a blown V-6 in the A8, but entry pricing currently buys a 4.2-liter direct-injected V-8. Jaguar's slinky new XJ opens with a free-breathing V-8 that delivers class-leading power, but you needn't 'fess up to that factoid. The short-wheelbase version would be the political play, but we could only get a stretched XJL. The Lexus hybrid flagship is priced (and powered) like a V-12, so these times call for an LS 460 V-8. To these obvious contenders we're adding two wild cards. Porsche has sawed two cylinders off the four-door Panamera's V-8 to produce a 3.6-liter V-6 (Porsche's first ever), with a nearly puritanical base price of just $75,375. And Korea has mustered the chutzpah to field an entrant in the über-lux segment with the Hyundai Equus. It matches the mainstreamers on power, space, and amenities at a price that could almost make T. Boone Pickens consider trading in his Town Car for one (with natural gas conversion). Which vehicle offers the perfect balance of performance, panache, and propriety? Read on. 7th place: Hyundai Equus A LIMOUSINE PRICED TO COVER THE CHAUFFEUR'S SALARY Extraterrestrials and Amazonian natives weighing the merits of these seven cars absent any prejudice for automotive history, brand name cachet, resale value, and myriad other psychographic factors that influence luxedan purchases will find Hyundai's new flagship compelling. Its creamy-smooth V-8 produces the same 385 horses as the Jaguar from less displacement (there's less torque, too). Its interior volume matches the Mercedes-Benz S-Class'. It's nearly as quiet as the Lexus. Its back seat reclines and provides remote controls for the climate, audio, front-passenger seat position, and sunshades -- and our Equus test car was the base $58,900 Signature model. The $65,400 Ultimate variant is even more gilded. Hyundai sweetens the deal further, giving owners something to brag about at cocktail parties when the name fails to impress. "Oh, yeah? Well, does Mercedes-Benz come to your home or business and swap you a loaner car whenever you need an oil change?!" Yes, 5-year wear and maintenance is fully covered without subjecting Equus owners to the ignominy of mingling with the Accent/Elantra-buying hoi polloi. But even ETs will admit the design, inside and out, is derivative and bland, and while the quality of the leather and wood trim will wow folks moving up from a Genesis (or TL or G37), the S-Class/7 Series buyer will sniff cost savings. There's no innovation here, as associate road test editor Carlos Lago wrote: "Hyundai has painted by numbers, while the rest have attempted making art." The noisy climate-control fan races when the sun hits the dash, but stability-control programming bests Lexus'. Ride quality is superb in normal mode, but don't touch that Sport button. It makes throttle tip-in jumpy with minimal change to handling. As associate online editor Michael Febbo said, "Other car designers install sport buttons with motorsport in mind. Hyundai designers thought about badminton." This car's heart isn't in road-carving (as its lowest-in-test 0.81g grip and second-slowest acceleration and figure-eight performance attest); it's in smooth chauffeuring. At that it excels. Anyway, ETs should probably be chauffeured. 2011 Hyundai Equus BASE PRICE $58,900 PRICE AS TESTED $58,900 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front engine, RWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINES 4.6L/385-hp/333-lb-ft DOHC 32-valve V-8 TRANSMISSION 6-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 4502 lb (52/48%) WHEELBASE 119.9 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 203.1 x 74.4 x 58.7 in 0-60 MPH 6.2 sec QUARTER MILE 14.6 sec @ 98.7 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 127 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.81 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 27.8 sec @ 0.60 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 16/24 mpg CO2 EMISSIONS 1.03 lb/mile MT OBS FUEL ECON 15.7 mpg 6th Place: Mercedes-Benz S400 Hybrid MAY THE BEST CAR FINISH 6TH? "You always feel as if you're in the best car here," said test director Kim Reynolds of driving the granite-hewn bank-vault S-Class, adding that it'd be his choice of these cars in which to slam into a wall. At $88,825, the S400 Hybrid wears the priciest base sticker in the group, and in fact an off-lease used S550 is the true price/performance competitor for our new BMW/Audi/Jaguar mainstreamers, so this mild hybrid is kind of in a class of its own. Most of what the Hyundai lacks, the Mercedes overflows with. Technical innovation? Benz invented the car 125 years ago and has pioneered countless now ubiquitous technologies on the S-Class (crumple zones, seatbelt pretensioners, electronic stability control). This one was among the first hybrids to use a lithium-ion battery. Credibility? Turn on CNN and you'll find S-Classes ferrying presidents and potentates around the world. Class and cachet? Just look at the restrained and elegant narrow strips of chrome-trimmed glossy wood. That said, efforts made to maximize fuel economy detract from the driving experience. Gearing is ultra-long-legged, compounding the 15.2-pound burden each of its 295 combined horses carries and making this the slowest of the group to 60 mph at 7.0 seconds. At least its 18.9-mpg trip mileage trumped all but the feathery Porsche on our 200-mile loop. Low rolling-resistance tires similarly stunt handling, and aggressive electric regen spoils the brake feel. All this ends up goading the driver to smoothness, not hooliganism-just as the Equus does. As Febbo noted, "Other cars try to convince you they are smaller than they are; the Mercedes flaunts its size." Well, if you've got it... Our youngest voter, Lago, found the user interface's combination of a multifunction knob and lots of toggle buttons cumbersome and felt the Lexus did everything as well for $11,186 less, damning the Benz as "a German Town Car." Febbo summed up the older voters' counterpoint thus: "No other car in the comparison, no matter how good it is, will ever feel as exclusive." 2010 Mercedes-Benz S400 Hybrid BASE PRICE $88,825 PRICE AS TESTED $89,565 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front engine, RWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINES 3.5L/275-hp/258-lb-ft DOHC 24-valve V-6 plus 20-hp/118-lb-ft elec motor; 295-hp/284 lb-ft comb TRANSMISSION 7-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 4490 lb (53/47%) WHEELBASE 124.6 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 206.5 x 73.7 x 58.0 in 0-60 MPH 7.0 sec QUARTER MILE 15.3 sec @ 91.9 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 122 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.83 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 28.2 sec @ 0.62 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 19/25 mpg CO2 EMISSIONS 0.91 lb/mile MT OBS FUEL ECON 18.9 mpg 5th Place: Jaguar XJL SENSORY OVERLORD Right-brain thinkers may be excused for disregarding everything we write about the other six cars and simply rushing out and grabbing one of these, so strong is its emotional appeal -- or repulsion. Reynolds loathes this car almost as much as some of us adore it. Jaguar offers a Babette's feast for all the senses in this XJL. Every line, curve, and surface inside and out engages the eye as something fresh and new. Love or hate the black C-pillars, nobody can ignore them. Ditto the gigantic chrome eyeball air vents and book-matched and mirror-matched matte-finish wood trim inside. The base V-8 serenades the ears with an old-money melody like that of a mahogany Chris-Craft inboard. Twin-needle-stitched leather covers practically everything that's not chrome or wood inside, delighting the senses of touch and smell. And taste? Well, selecting this car will suggest yours isn't all in your mouth. Given its test-topping 385-horse/380-pound-foot engine and feathery aluminum construction (at 4132 pounds, only the puny Porsche is lighter), it should surprise nobody that this is the drag-racing champ, hitting the quarter mile in just 13.5 seconds at 106.2 mph, 0.4 second ahead of the next-best Audi. It's also pretty eager to go around corners with the suspension set to its Dynamic mode, feeling almost as agile as the BMW. Of course, Reynolds, our ride-quality guru, noted this suspension setting "won't leave you confused about what mode it's in." A common gripe was that the steering effort was too light for how quick it turns in at speed, imparting a nervous feeling. While the design, amenities, and comfort of the interior were beyond reproach, the lethargic touch-screen had reproach heaped upon it. "Could we divert two of the V-8's cylinders to powering the computer when they aren't needed for accelerating the car?" asked Febbo. But the elephant in the room was reliability, and when a hood-latch sensor fritzed, preventing the doors from locking, Lucas jokes went flying. Technical director Markus hesitates to recommend it to friends, but would choose this one to own. 2011 Jaguar XJL BASE PRICE $80,575 PRICE AS TESTED $83,875 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front engine, RWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINES 5.0L/385-hp/380-lb-ft DOHC 32-valve V-8 TRANSMISSION 6-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 4132 lb (51/49%) WHEELBASE 124.3 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 206.6 x 74.6 x 57.0 in 0-60 MPH 5.0 sec QUARTER MILE 13.5 sec @ 106.2 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 121 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.85 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 26.4 sec @ 0.66 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 16/23 mpg CO2 EMISSIONS 1.05 lb/mile MT OBS FUEL ECON 17.1 mpg 4th Place: Lexus LS 460 LEXUS LUTHOR Bad boy genes must be migrating up the Lexus line from the IS-F, or down from the LFA. Mind you, they're as hidden as Lex Luthor's lairs, but don't let that staid facade of introverted Asian design fool you. Press the super-secret TRAC button on the console and this Sport-package-equipped short-wheelbase luxury liner will oblige the right foot with enough throttle oversteer to make your innocent drive up Mulholland Highway feel like Drift King Keiichi Tsuchiya nailing a Touge run. With each successive generation of LS, the Sport package becomes less oxymoronic (try, try again, Hyundai!). Now it includes Brembo brakes, forged 19-inch wheels, summer tires, sport suspension tuning, and quick, matched-rev shifting of the eight-speed automatic. All this helps it feel more athletic than its fifth-place performance numbers suggest. Neglect to press that TRAC button under the correct circumstances to awaken the beast, however, and the Lexus' hectoring fun nanny beeps, blinks and "cuts power for a three count-a time-out to think about what you've done," noted Febbo, who otherwise found the car lacking in soul. Of course, that sporting hardware never compromises Lexus' prime directive, which is providing serene isolation. Select Comfort suspension mode and you float along on a cushion of Cool Whip (Normal is better). Lexus' eight-speed transmission is geared taller with wider spacing in the lower ratios relative to Audi's, so it never seems busy. This helps explain its slower acceleration (6.0 versus 5.5 seconds to 60 mph). The LS 460's rear seat was deemed most comfortable, despite its short-wheelbase dearth of legroom. Its control interface, featuring buttons large enough to accommodate full English wording on them, was also deemed easiest to master. Let's face it, this is the most rational choice for the thinking plutocrat: No money squandered on a flashier Euro brand name, brilliant engineering, sterling quality reputation, and sufficient cachet to fit in at the club. Lago said this was the ideal car for a family member, so naturally he ranked it fourth. 2011 Lexus LS 460 BASE PRICE $66,230 PRICE AS TESTED $79,229 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front engine, RWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINES 4.6L/380-hp/367-lb-ft DOHC 32-valve V-8 TRANSMISSION 8-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 4477 lb (52/48%) WHEELBASE 116.9 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 199.2 x 73.8 x 58.1 in 0-60 MPH 6.0 sec QUARTER MILE 14.4 sec @ 99.4 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 119 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.84 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 26.9 sec @ 0.68 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 16/24 mpg CO2 EMISSIONS 1.03 lb/mile MT OBS FUEL ECON 15.9 mpg 3rd Place: Audi A8 BUM STEER Audi's low, wide, menacing A8 was the going-in favorite of many voters who had been smitten by its faultless interior and exterior aesthetics and its strong showing in our Car of the Year exercises. Indeed, it looks formidable on paper. With all four of the biggest footprints in this test clawing for traction, it came as no surprise that the A8 relished scrabbling up through our test route's twisty Mulholland Highway switchbacks, putting the power down effectively with little or no electronic intervention. Our handling test results reflect this reality with a figure-eight lap time (25.8 seconds) and peak lateral grip (0.95 g) that are second only to the nimbler and 426-pound lighter Porsche. Boasting the widest gear-ratio spread and the shortest, most closely spaced lower ratios among the torque-converter automatics, this hefty all-wheeler nearly managed to catch the frisky Jaguar in the quarter mile, falling 0.4 second short at 13.9 seconds and 103.1 mph. But while many found the chassis "the most confidence-inspiring of the group," as former European Car editor Mike Febbo did, Reynolds noted that when really hustling the A8, it "felt as if it might break, like a piece of porcelain." All of us disapproved of the dynamic steering system that comes bundled with the otherwise laudable $5900 Sport package. None of its three effort-level settings provides natural feedback or heft, and the variable ratio requires acclimation. The interior design and materials won us all over, prompting this gush from Febbo: "I'm convinced I'm in a car from the future. The interior of this A8 is a mix of 'Tron,' Apple, and a luxury space yacht." It's plenty comfortable, too, though not terribly space efficient (measuring largest outside, it ranks fifth on interior space). Its MMI raised the ire of Lago and Reynolds, who found it obtuse and infuriating. Its electronic shifter makes selecting Reverse so difficult that three-point U-turns are out of the question. Those niggles were sufficient to knock it down two places, but it remains Febbo's choice to own. 2011 Audi A8 BASE PRICE $78,925 PRICE AS TESTED $89,325 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front engine, AWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINES 4.2L/372-hp/328-lb-ft DOHC 32-valve V-8 TRANSMISSION 8-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 4359 lb (55/45%) WHEELBASE 117.8 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 202.2 x 76.7 x 57.5 in 0-60 MPH 5.5 sec QUARTER MILE 13.9 sec @ 103.1 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 106 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.95 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 25.8 sec @ 0.67 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 17/27 mpg CO2 EMISSIONS 0.95 lb/mile MT OBS FUEL ECON 16.7 mpg 2nd Place: Porsche Panamera FLY PAN-AM A biz-jet among limos. That's what this feels like, literally. The cockpit's intimidating rows of buttons lining the center and overhead consoles and its high-tech gauges appear equipped to control the Rolls BR710 jet engines of a Gulfstream G500 instead of a mere 300-horse V-6. Likewise the four firm, narrow bucket seats offer minimal adjustment and no shoulder support, but heighten the airy, intimate private-plane feel. Although the numbers look middling (at 13.1 pounds per pony, only the BMW and Mercedes horses pull more weight), that magical seven-speed PDK trans makes the most of all 295 pound-feet of twist. Its gear ratio spread of 10.12 is 43 percent wider than the next-best Audi eight-speed's, allowing a super-short first gear to compensate for the lack of a torque converter. No-loss twin-clutch shifting further contributes to its third-best 14.1-second, 99.8-mph quarter-mile sprint. Only in parking maneuvers and slow launches does the PDK feel jerky. But it's in the handling department where the Panamera really distinguishes itself. "Forget a gun at a knife fight, Porsche's brought a bazooka to a bake sale," says Febbo. Not only is this the smallest and lightest car here, it's also the only one that makes no pretense of providing a plush ride. Normal suspension tuning feels like everyone else's sportiest; Sport+ feels right for the starting grid at LeMans. Then there's Porsche's legendary steering, which always feels natural, its variable ratio never making itself known as most others do. No wonder it smote all the others in our handling tests: 0.99g lateral grip and 25.0 seconds flat at 0.76 g around the figure-eight match 911 Carrera S performance. None of us likes its styling, but Reynolds pointed out the original bathtub Porsches weren't exactly ravishing beauties, either. Detroit editor Todd Lassa and Lago would own this one anyway, without the $16K in options. But it's a selfish person's car. Yes, it accommodates four six-footers, but the driver has all the fun. Passengers enjoy no coddling, a so-so sound system, and iffy rear visibility. Who cares? We're cleared for takeoff. 2011 Porsche Panamera BASE PRICE $75,375 PRICE AS TESTED $91,670 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front engine, RWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINES 3.6L/300-hp/295-lb-ft DOHC 24-valve V-6 TRANSMISSION 7-speed twin-cl auto CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 3933 lb (52/48%) WHEELBASE 115.0 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 195.7 x 76.0 x 55.8 in 0-60 MPH 5.5 sec QUARTER MILE 14.1 sec @ 99.8 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 105 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.99 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 25.0 sec @ 0.76 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 18/27 mpg CO2 EMISSIONS 0.92 lb/mile MT OBS FUEL ECON 19.7 mpg 1st Place: BMW 740i RELUCTANT CONQUEROR Legions of you will assert the fix was in. That the congenital BMWphilia that afflicts all car-mag writers struck again. Or that our 740i's 14.0-cubic-foot trunk arrived filled with unmarked $20s. Quite the contrary. The senior Bimmer showed up as an underdog. Its twin-turbo V-8 750i sibling didn't even make the finals in our 2010 Car of the Year competition, nor did its 550i stepbrother this year. In fact, when we began deliberations on the finishing order in this test, most expected the 740i to finish in the upper middle of the ranking because it didn't seem to excel at any one thing. Then we started discussing the priorities for this class of car. Spacious, comfortable seating? Front-seat room ranks second to the Hyundai's, and rear space nearly matches it, trailing the long-wheelbase Jag and cavernous Mercedes (an extra $4400 buys the 740Li if you're ferrying NBA forwards); all four headrests boast airplane-style side wings; and the zillion-way adjustable multicontour front seats ($1300) feel sublime. Cars in this class should be technology leaders, but they need to be user-friendly. After several generations of Sevens, BMW is getting that second part right. The latest button-ringed iDrive infuriated far fewer of us than Audi's shifter and MMI or Jag's pokey touch screen, though it trails the big-button/touch-screen Lexus and Hyundai interfaces. As for tech, the active roll stabilization and dynamic damping that comes with the $6500 M Sport package represent the state of the suspension art. Inveterate gadgeteers can add night-vision with pedestrian detection ($2600), a head-up display ($1300), and around-view cameras ($1200). Prestige, panache, and style? BMW may not outrank Mercedes-Benz or Porsche when valets compute the mental tip calculus that determines which car gets parked closest to the entrance, but the Roundel identifies its owner as someone who cares more about driving than arriving. Style is in the eye of the beholder, and Febbo held that this is perhaps "the best-looking 7 ever," while Lago reluctantly admitted that "the flame surfacing finally works." We all rank it well ahead of the Porsche and the Asians, if not the Jag or Audi. Of course, the criterion we enjoy evaluating most is performance, and we use this category to sort contenders that are closely ranked in the other criteria. Here we were pleasantly surprised by the twin-scroll turbocharged inline-six. Only the Hybrid Benz carries more weight per horsepower, but short gearing helps make the most of the available torque. Lago noted: "There's plentiful torque in every nook and cranny of the rev band, it doesn't feel underpowered, and it's the best sounding six-cylinder here to boot." At 5.5 seconds, 0-to-60 performance ties the Audi and Porsche and is a half-second behind the killer Jag. Drag racing isn't the point of these cars, but taking the long way home down a twisting canyon road sure can take the edge off a hard day of corporate raiding, ambulance-chasing, or whatever earns the kind of cash these cars' owners pull down, and here the 740i really delighted us. Maybe it's the fact that the front axle carries 239 fewer pounds than in our last 750i, or perhaps the active steering system calibration has been tweaked, but most drivers agreed with Reynolds' assessment: "The quicker you go in this car, the smaller it becomes. The Audi was somewhat awkward in the corners, occasionally growing bigger and smaller depending what the chassis decided to do. The BMW stayed permanently shrunk." Credit the absolutely flat cornering attitude afforded by the hydraulic anti-roll bars, impressive 0.91g grip from the Goodyear run-flats, and fast, intuitive shifts from the transmission (though we all lamented the lack of shift paddles, which every other car but the Equus provides). On the figure eight's corners, the 740i made up time lost to the A8 on the straights, scoring an identical 25.8-second lap time at higher average g (0.73 to 0.67). By the end of our deliberations, the BMW found itself backing into the winner's circle by doing everything 80-90 percent right without doing anything terribly wrong, all at a moderate price (third "cheapest," base and as tested). Reynolds summarized it best: "A nice blend of everything. The BMW is near-expert at all the things you ask of it -- casual driving, forceful driving -- it never has egg on its face." Yet he's the only voter who would own the 740i, which points out a peculiarity of this class of cars. They're so unique and complex that ranking them is more difficult than ranking commodity cars built to a formula, like midsize sedans. With these flagships, each manufacturer is flexing its design and engineering muscles to express brand values and provide a halo for high-profit models. Each is imbued with such a unique character and personality that our voters all ranked them differently.

It's very good, though in Harman Industries' hierarchy, Lexicon plays Buick to Mark Levinson's Cadillac, and sure enough, the Hyundai's system doesn't have the depth or complexity of the Lexus' Levinson setup. The base Audi, BMW and Mercedes systems and the entry-level ($1440) Porsche/Bose system all delivered considerable medium-to-high-volume distortion. These lower-investment systems all sound muddy next to the premium-brand setups. Though I'm no audiophile, I come closest among staffers on this comparo to acting like one, so I lent my 52-year-old ears to a blindfold taste-test faceoff of the Jag's Bowers and Wilkins and the Lexus' Levinson. I rode in the left rear seat of each car listening to most of "So What," from a CD of Miles Davis' magnificent "Kind of Blue," recorded in 1959. I picked the Lexus' system. The Jaguar's superior speaker separation, apparent from the driver's seat, was lost from the rear seat. Though I like the B&W's higher highs and lack of reliance on bass, the Mark Levinson system simply has more depth, more timbre. Bassist Paul Chambers' first lines in "So What" are so subtle and sublime that they wash out in most inferior audio systems. You hear them in the Jag's B&W system. You feel them in the Lexus' Mark Levinson. - Todd Lassa

We Don't Like: Driver-selectable AWD switch; Suspect build quality The new Chevrolet Equinox is worlds better than the version it replaces, but for every step forward it takes, the competition takes two. Although significantly smaller than the version it replaces, it feels bigger inside. Thanks to the Equinox's new platform, Chevy was able to boost rear-passenger space, even engineering away that pesky drive shaft hump in back, making the middle seat actually usable. Chevy also revamped the Equinox's powertrains. We only had access to the 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo I-4 engine paired to a nine-speed automatic and optional all-wheel drive, but Chevrolet also offers a 170-hp 1.5-liter turbo I-4 and a fuel-efficient 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4. Don't miss all the latest Car, Truck and SUV of the Year content at MotorTrendAwards.com! The top-shelf engine has plenty of power on tap, and the new nine-speed shifts quickly and decisively. The Chevy handles well, too, with exceptional body control and sporty steering. The big negative is the driver-selectable all-wheel-drive switch; the all-wheel-drive system only activates if the driver remembers to press a poorly placed and dimly lit switch on the center console. Forget to press the button or ignore the warnings on the instrument cluster, and getting stuck in snow, sand, or mud is a real possibility. The materials in the cabin felt built to price, but what holds the Equinox back is its suspect build quality: The door sheetmetal flexes if you gently brush against it, the hatchback creaks when opened and closed, and a weird, booming sound emanates from the back of the cabin at highway speeds. The competition has already set a benchmark far ahead of the Equinox.

AA3fe19	autos	autosnews	First Drive: 2008 Maserati GranTurismo	Others in its class may offer more power, handling, reliability, and even exclusivity, but with the 2008 Maserati GranTurismo, Maserati brings sexy back to Grand Touring with a unique blend of personality and panache.Find out more about the 2008 Maserati GT from the automotive experts at Motor Trend.	Prepare for seething derision and witty zingers, because this car has it coming. The spec sheet is rife with fodder: Relative to its Porsche 911-fighting Coupe/Gran Sport predecessor, Maserati's new GranTurismo is over 14 inches longer, an inch wider, nearly two inches taller, and-mamma mia!-550 pounds heavier! And there's no commensurate power boost to help propel this porker, just a nudge up to 400 horses. To make things worse, the suspension's softer and the six-speed stick and auto-clutch manual transaxles are broomed for a front-mounted ZF six-speed slushbox. The livid car critic prepares to lob some bombast at the Trident, perhaps likening this jarring transition to that of an Italian woman from sexy seductress to rotund housewife. Then he rounds the corner to find eight GranTurismos arrayed on the cathedral square in Bolzano, Italy and ashcans that line of attack. This car is twice as seductive as its predecessor, precisely because of its Amazon proportions. Supersizing to the Quattroporte sedan architecture afforded Pininfarina room to package a roomier rear seat under a sleeker fastback roof with classic long-hood, short-deck, flying-wedge proportions. Even the jewelry is gorgeous, much of it paying homage to historic Maseratis: The portholes recall the company's first road car, the 1947 A6 1500 Gran Turismo (by Pinin Farina), and the concave grille harks to the 1953 A6GCS. The headlamps and the optional 20-inch Trident-spoke wheels riff on Pininfarina's Birdcage concept car. The new shape is 0.33-Cd aero-slick too. Having never successfully fought the 911, Maserati is abandoning that cutthroat market for greener ($) pastures now being grazed by the BMW 6 Series, Jag XKR, Mercedes CL-Class, and a few Bentley Continental GTs and Aston DB9s. Buyers in that crowd don't cotton to do-it-yourself shifting, nor do they adore a bone-crushing ride. They also demand a reasonable rear seat, and the GranTurismo's now seems competitive with the bigs in the class-Mercedes CL, Conti GT, and even Ferrari's 612 Scaglietti, though proper comparative SAE dimensions aren't available. (The tallest of the gathered critics, at six-foot-three, proclaimed it tolerable for a crosstown trek to dinner, as long as someone slightly less leggy sat in front.) Rear-cabin riders get their own A/C vents, cupholders, armrests, and stowage bins. The 9.2-cubic-foot trunk even holds two real golf bags or a set of Ferragamo fitted luggage. This mega-metamorphosis is starting to make sense. Mechanically, the car is a Quattroporte automatic with 4.8 inches sawed out of the wheelbase and 2.6 inches off the tail. The drivetrain and "Skyhook" adaptive suspension are tailored to the GranTurismo's sportier mission. Press the dash button marked "Sport" and throttle responsiveness increases 20 percent, the dampers stiffen to curtail body roll and float, and the transmission shift logic becomes more aggressive. In that mode the torque converter stays locked during shifts that happen 40 percent quicker (in about 0.33 second), lower gears are held longer, upshifts happen at higher revs (up to 7200 rpm at full throttle-a claimed highest in class), and downshifts occur at lighter throttle openings. A separate "Ice" setting blocks first-gear launches and forces upshifts at 3000 rpm. Graduating to the Q-porte's architecture also brings amenities like corner-illuminating Xenon headlamps, a seven-inch nav screen, and a new eight-channel/11-speaker Bose Surround Sound system with a 30-gig hard drive. (Sorry, no Bluetooth until mid-2008.) But perhaps the greatest luxury is personalization, and customers willing to wait four months for delivery can custom-tailor their GranTurismos with a choice of 10 Poltrona Frau leather colors, 13 stitching tones, four headliner colors (in cloth or Alcantara), five carpet hues, and a choice of three woods, five colored piano-lacquers, or metal for the dash trim. Outside there's a choice of 19 body colors and two wheel designs in three finishes. With over four million possible combinations, every GranTurismo will probably be unique. Recalibrating his mindset from weekend-racer Porschephile to Grand-Touring playboy (like the swells who queued up to buy 5000 GTs, Ghiblis, and Khamsins in their day), our mellowing critic points the nav toward Moena and heads off onto the spilled-spaghetti byways crisscrossing the mountains of German-speaking Italy. In the narrow village streets, the car's width intimidates but the exhaust note bouncing back off the buildings sounds totally operatic-if a mite sotto voce (a two-stage muffler is in the works to meet Euro regs while permitting a bit more volume when the hammer's down). On an open roadway, the performance impresses-in part because of that intoxicating baritone howl (0-to-60 acceleration is estimated at a modest 5.1 seconds). Pull out to pass a Fiat diesel, though, and the 400 horses don't all pull their 10.4 pounds as quickly as the engine note suggests they might, forcing more than a few aborted passes. (Pray hard to Santo Nettuno, and maybe he'll grant us an SS model with the 4.7-liter, 450-horse V-8 Maserati builds for Alfa Romeo's 8C.) Paddle-shifts occur reasonably quickly, but the controller seems overly cautious about allowing downshifts. The BMW 335i's version of this same basic transmission is more aggressive in making downshifts and delaying upshifts. With 51 percent of its weight on the rear axle (even more with people onboard), a limited-slip differential, providing 25-percent lockup under power and 45-percent on overrun, and Pirelli PZero Rosso tires that are wider in back (285/40-19s versus 245/40-19s in front), the car is setup for neutral to understeering behavior, and it's nearly impossible to kick the tail out in the dry, even with the stability control switched off. Dive too hot into a hairpin and grinding understeer ensues, but finesse the trail-braking and manage the weight transfer a bit, and she corners on rails, bringing a smile to the driver without striking panic in the passenger (who nevertheless could sure use a grab handle). The big car shrinks on an open road, thanks in part to light but very direct steering that describes the road surface with more little twitches and wiggles than one expects in such a big car, and to the confidence inspired by a firm brake pedal controlling 13-inch discs clamped by four-piston Brembo calipers at each corner (available in six colors!). Struggling to avoid the appearance of having been too easily seduced by a pretty face, our smitten critic declares the $114,650 GranTurismo in dire need of another 50 horsepower, but admits the softer, grander package better suits the brand. And with calendar-2007 production sold out, the GranTurismo will return Maserati to profitability in December. Some 1400 are scheduled for worldwide distribution in 2008, with production rising at roughly 15 percent per year (that's the rate at which the ultrarich population is growing). Others in its class may offer more power, handling, reliability, and even exclusivity, but Maserati brings sexy back to Grand Touring with a unique blend of personality and panache. 2008 Maserati GranTurismo Base price $114,650 Vehicle layout Front-engine, RWD, 4-pass, 2-door, coupe Engine 4.2L/400-hp/339-lb-ft DOHC 32-valve V-8 Transmission 6-speed automatic Curb weight 4150 lb (mfr) Wheelbase 115.8 in Length x width x height 192.2 x 72.7 x 53.3 in 0-60 mph 5.1 sec (mfr est) EPA city/hwy fuel econ 11 / 16 mpg CO2 emissions 1.52 lb/mile On sale in U.S. Currently
AA2guvq	health	wellness	9 ways personality influences your taste preferences	Whether you're daring, flirtatious or passive, your personality influences what you eat.	Whether you're daring, flirtatious or passive, your personality influences what you eat. What does your palate say about you? A craving for potato chips, sushi or Szechuan food might have more to do with your personality than your taste buds, according to several studies. Just like your personality influences your favorite color, song or movie, experts say personality traits have a lot of pull over the food you pile on your plate. "Through our food preferences and choices we reveal inner thoughts, feelings, wishes and desires," says Dr. Alan Hirsch, a neurologist and psychiatrist, and founder of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. "It's no exaggeration to say that the foods we choose provide a window to our unconscious." Wondering what your palate says about you? Read on to learn more about the link between personality and your favorite foods. Hot peppers and spicy foods Can't help but cram sky diving, hang gliding or bungee jumping into your weekend? A study from Penn State says thrill seekers are more apt to flirt with setting their mouth on fire by digging into fiery foods than those who are mild-mannered or passive. The scientists speculate that capsaicin, the compound that gives hot peppers their zing, links your taste buds' passion for peppers and an adrenaline rush, and that eating foods with capsaicin can simulate the rush of living on the edge. "You take the risk that hot peppers and similar foods will burn your mouth, just like you risk your life sky diving," says Keith Kantor, a nutritionist and author of "What Matters: Leadership Values That Just Might Save America." Kantor says hot-pepper lovers are also usually more tolerant of change than other people. "They might like the thrill associated with something new around the corner." There's nothing bland about those who stock up on spicy foods, Albers says. "They tend to like complexity and interesting tastes, and often score high in the 'sensation seeking' category on personality tests." Sensation seekers like new experiences and thrills, whether it's a new spicy food, a horror film festival or a death-defying roller coaster. Salty foods A thirst for salty foods is common in those who crave small rewards and immediate gratification, according to research led by Hirsch. As a result, potato-chip lovers are competitive and worthy adversaries. "They're ambitious and enjoy rewards in both business and pleasure," he says. Chip lovers are also easily frustrated at life's little inconveniences, such as rush-hour traffic or long lines at the checkout. "Whether they're at Disneyland, the DMV or behind the wheel, they tend to always be in a rush," Hirsch says. Psychologist Susan Albers, author of "EatQ," says that about a quarter of the population are "supertasters," which means they have more taste buds than the average Joe. This makes them more likely to dislike bitter foods or things with strong tastes. However, a Penn State study says supertasters' taste buds love salt. One theory is that sodium dulls the bitterness in foods. Comforting carbs Pasta, bread and other comfort carbohydrates go hand-in-hand with having a serious side and staying inside the lines. In short, carb lovers can be cautious and even err of the side of passivity rather than being socially or professionally aggressive. "These food lovers aren't generally risk takers and usually don't like change," Kantor says. That's not to say that they're boring. In fact, they can be thoughtful and have a lot to say. They're just more comfortable with knowing all the boundaries and staying well within them. "Lovers of carbs look to what's familiar and comfortable. And once they find it, they like to stick with it," Kantor says. Crunchy foods Research conducted by Hirsch found that perfectionists are prone to loving crunchy foods. "They have very high expectations for themselves and might redo a task or project if it's anything less than perfect," he says. Focused and energetic, those who call these snack foods their favorites are sticklers for punctuality and excited by challenges. But don't think that makes them work-obsessed grinds. "Our research found pretzel lovers are often the life of the party, lively, enthusiastic and fun to be with," Hirsch says. Tart and sour foods "Research has shown those who consume bitter foods tend to be more judgmental and harsher on those around them," Kantor says. That could be because of genetics. "Genetic sensitivity to bitter tastes has been linked with a greater number of food aversions, including foods that are tart. So people who don't like sour foods are likely to be very picky and opinionated about the food they eat," Albers says. However, if lemons don't make you pucker, Albers says the tolerance of extreme flavors predisposes you to being open to new foods and experiences. "Your DNA isn't wired to automatically object to things like lemons, widely believed to be unpleasant. So you might be willing to stretch your limits a bit." Tangy or citrus foods Taste buds tempted by tangy or citrus foods such as oranges and limes can be in search of a way to tame anxiety and stress, Albers says. Brazilian scientists found that citrus smells can have a calming influence. "Those who are more anxious may just be drawn to the refreshing and calming nature of citrus," she says. Citrus also is believed to help boost your immunity, so Albers says a craving for citrus could stem from subconscious worries about your health, even if you're not feeling sick. "People can be drawn to citrus foods not only because they feel better after consuming them, but also because they expect to feel better given the cognitive connection between drinking orange juice and fighting off illness," she says. Savory foods People who like spices often have a very refined sense of taste and may even have specific genetics that help them to distinguish among various spices. "They may have more sensitive chemosensory pathways, or cells within the body similar to taste buds," Albers says. As a result, she says, spice lovers generally are people who notice the details and have a refined sense of smell, since smell is closely related to the ability to taste. Research has shown that those who enjoy savory foods are sterner or more serious and less pleasant compared with those who enjoy sweet foods such as cookies and cakes, Kantor says. Exotic foods From frog legs and snails to bird's nest soup and fish sperm sashimi, the taste for exotic foods indicates that you're flexible and open to trying new things, Albers says. Those willing to "try anything once" and who have a "try it and see if I like it" attitude are rarely rattled, he says. "While they don't expect to like everything or every food, they're easygoing and see life   and food   as an adventure." Chocolate "A sweet tooth has been shown to be linked to a willingness to help people out," Kantor says. But chocolate lovers are also emotionally vulnerable, Hirsch adds. "They're charming, flirtatious and may even have a penchant for drama," he says. "But this makes them somewhat vulnerable in relationships, even though they truly enjoy intimacy and romance." Hirsch's research has found that chocolate lovers rely heavily on their intuition, often playing hunches rather than relying on logic. "They represent the prototype of their sex: the macho man and the very feminine woman are probably chocolate lovers."

This Hellcat-powered 1970 Challenger RT/SE could be the ultimate melding of classic styling, modern performance, and comfort. If you think back to your high school days, there's likely at least one car you used to see on a regular basis that was sitting neglected in someone's yard or under tree. You probably daydreamed about that	If you think back to your high school days, there's likely at least one car you used to see on a regular basis that was sitting neglected in someone's yard or under tree. You probably daydreamed about that car and wondered why on earth anyone would be so callous to treat it like that. You certainly wouldn't. You would get it back on the road to its former glory. For Larry Rose, this '70 Challenger RT/SE was that car. As a young man, he kept his eye on it as it sat neglected in a yard. He saw it every time he drove out to his grandma's house in Georgetown, IL and he would just shake his head and then spend most of the rest of the drive thinking about it. In most cases, stories like this usually include a few attempts at inquiring about the car, always to be turned away with declarations that it's not for sale. Larry's story went much better though. He kept an eye on the Challenger, and in 1989, he got wind that the car was for sale for $3,500. The bad news was that a light pole had fallen across the hood and gone through the windshield. Still, Larry knew that was the car, so at the age of 17, the Challenger became the first one he ever bought. Being a high school kid, money was tight, so Larry replaced the windshield and worked the fender back out as best as he could. He spent some time getting it reliable and drivable again, and the 383 Magnum, four-speed, Dana-rearend equipped coupe was his ride for the last two years of high school. As you would expect, there were many nights spent cruising the local hot spots to see and be seen. On one of those trips, Larry even managed to catch the attention of a good-looking girl who he took to prom. He didn't know it then, but she would eventually be his wife. Some say the cool car had a little something to do with that. Around 1990, Larry saved up enough from his job working at a pallet company after school to have a local shop swap on a fender, repair the hood, and spray on a new coat of Lime Green paint. Shortly thereafter, though, Larry went away to college and the Challenger went into storage for a few years. School comes first, but once he had time to devote to it again, the Challenger was back on the road, and at the drag strip. It was still running the stock drivetrain, and rowing gears down the track was fun, but to get more consistency Larry swapped in an automatic. Then to get more speed, he added a nitrous system. The Challenger remained in this form for the next few years, and was a force to be reckoned with. The RT/SE moved back and forth from the front to the back burner through the late '90s and early 2000s as life changed and other projects came and went, but around 2005 Larry started thinking about making some really big changes. The burgeoning pro touring movement was bringing on a surge of innovation in new products to make classic cars more powerful, better handling, and more fun. For all of its history so far, the Challenger had pretty much just been a straight-line car, but Larry was warming up to the idea of getting more well-rounded. While the 383 had been a great engine and taken a beating over the years, it was time for a freshening, so Larry took the opportunity to upgrade to a 440 6-pack. The automatic came out and a stick went back in, but instead of a four-speed, the Challenger got one more cruising leg from a five-speed swap. The really interesting stuff happened underneath the skin though. Rather than rebuild or upgrade the original suspension, Larry opted for a full Reilly Motorsports package with the AlterKtion system up front and the Street Lynx in the rear. To say this transformed the Challenger would be an understatement. It was like a whole new animal and Larry fell in love with it all over again and started driving it a lot more. There are things you learn about a car the more you drive it, especially when you've become accustomed to the nice things modern cars offer. For example, while a 6-pack looks oh-so-cool when you pop the hood, keeping it perfectly tuned in all conditions can be a bit of a chore. Plus, it's not exactly easy on fuel. Since Larry was enjoying driving the Challenger more and planning to attend the 2012 Hot Rod Power Tour, he started looking at fuel-injection options and settled on a FAST EZ-EFI system. Notwithstanding, even with the more precise fuel and ignition control, Larry discovered the often lower quality fuel available in rural areas caused a lot of spark knock, requiring him to stop and manually adjust the timing. Larry and his wide Kara were sold on the Power Tour, so Larry decided that the next evolution of the Challenger needed to be in the direction of easy long-distance touring. He wasn't willing to give up on performance however, not by a long shot. Thanks to the modular design of the AlterKtion K-member, Larry knew he could easily swap to a different engine family, including a Gen-III Hemi. After some planning sessions, Larry placed a call to Cleveland Power and Performance to get one of their running pallets with an '08 6.1L Hemi and complete wiring harness. While he was at it, he figured it was a great time to add a Magnuson supercharger. To preempt grenading the five-speed, Larry ordered a Tremec six-speed to handle the grunt. Larry and Kara attended more Power Tours with the Challenger in this configuration, and Larry discovered how much fun a boosted Gen-III can be on the drag strip. We guess you could say that was his gateway to late-model drivetrain performance. That brings us to 2016. While all of those upgrades were cool, we know what you really want to know: How hard could a Hellcat swap be? If the Challenger already had a blown Gen-III in it, how hard could it be, right? Wrong. The answer is really hard, and plenty expensive. Even more so because of Larry's choice of transmission. Before the stick shift brigade gets their pitchforks, if you haven't driven one, you've got no argument to stand on. The 8HP90 is a marvel and to be perfectly honest, the best transmission option for the Hellcat and easily among the best performance-oriented, non-dual clutch self-shifting transmissions on the market. Sure, there was a point in time where a manual transmission was the only way to go, but those days are gone. Starting with the roots, the 8HP90 debuted in the BMW 760Li behind a V12 engine, so it was engineered for precision behind power. Weighing less than 10 pounds more than the five-speed automatic it replaces, the eight forward gears work to keep the Hellcat engine in its most efficient rpm range with tight ratios of 4.71, 3.14, 2.10, 1.67, 1.29, 1.00, 0.84 and 0.67:1, with a 3.30:1 Reverse. Thanks to that 4.71 first gear, the Hellcat uses a tiny 2.62:1 rear axle ratio, yet delivers a 12.34:1 torque multiplication factor in first gear. For perspective, to achieve the same value with a 1970 street-spec Hemi Challenger, the standard 2.45 first gear would require huge 4.88 gears. Eye opening, huh? And while six-speed drivers may enjoy the connected feeling they get from the stick shift and clutch pedal, there's no beating the 160 milliseconds shifts in Track mode. And that, friends, is why Larry decided to enter untested waters and keep it for the swap. We say "untested," because the 8HP90 is not a currently supported swap. Yes, there are at least two swaps we know of running around with one, Roadkill's General Mayhem and the Gas Monkey Garage 1967 Dodge Dart "Shartcat," but that doesn't mean the info is accessible out there for everyone. Also, it's a different case if you don't want to hack your car up as much as they did. So with no harness or ECU available other than the stock parts, trying to integrate 2015 systems with 1970, plus a few aftermarket systems, opens up a world of complications. As far as we know, Larry's is one of the few Hellcat swaps currently drivable and he's still about 95 percent of the way to having it all figured out. The only current nagging concern is the ECU defaulting to limp mode after 130 mph. Larry speculates it could be a VSS issue related to the 3.54 gears in the Dana 60 causing the ECU to believe the vehicle's absolute speed is too high, which, if determined to be the case, creates another issue since no one produces a 2.62 gear set for a Dana 60. That's also why you see the stunted power numbers in the Fast Facts, since the Challenger cannot hit full rpm on the dyno. Still, in current form, Larry reports the Challenger is totally drivable and road-trip reliable. If you're looking for the easier route, Larry advises using a GM 4L60 series with a standalone controller. On the topic of "not supported," the Hellcat technically isn't either, because even though it's a Gen-III Hemi, it's most definitely not the same level of install. Even though Larry had already installed a 6.1, the Hellcat was not a direct drop-in. For one, because of the lines routed from the rear of the supercharger, the engine had to be moved forward inch. Then there's the six heat exchangers and all the requisite plumbing. For example, to cool the intake air and maximize density, a 250-watt thermostatically controlled electric pump moves 45 liters of coolant per minute through two intercoolers built into the flanks of the supercharger and two radiators positioned at the front of the car. You can't just shove them any old place they fit; they need strong airflow and Hellcat-equipped cars are designed with this in mind. In fact, when Larry spoke to Chrysler engineers at a show once, they said one of the biggest issues he would likely face would be getting enough airflow to the coolers to keep the Hellcat out of limp mode. Working within the envelope the '70 offers, Larry's solution was to position the coolers within the fenders for the best airflow and add slim auxiliary fans. While he has not attempted open-track use, this solution has been effective for regular street use and Power Tour. Wiring is its own adventure with a swap like this. The complex multi-tiered electrical system in the production car features multiple computers that all retrieve data from each other. The challenge is figuring what you can eliminate and what you can't. For example, disconnect the wheel-speed sensors and you'll trigger a code and disable the traction control, stability control, and speedo, but the car would still be drivable. On the other hand, the car would not crank at all if the ABS module were unplugged. That's why Larry's Challenger has the Hellcat ABS module mounted and plugged in, even though it's not actually doing anything. As for the rest of the wiring, Larry reached out to numerous resources to confirm what was critical to operation. If the Challenger had a modern dash swap, it would be lit up like a Christmas tree with warning lights from triggered codes, but none are mission critical. Despite the fact that it's already a driver and has taken home the Mopar Muscle Editor's Choice award at the 2017 Mopar Nats, the saga of the '70 Hellcat is actually an ongoing one as Larry irons out the technical details to get his RT/SE as turnkey as a brand-new Challenger. The plan is to have all the details ironed out so that he can offer the swap to customers of his shop, Larry's Automotive in Newburgh, IN, with minimal hassle and using only the necessary components. Plus, if you haven't noticed by now, Larry loves to upgrade and change this car, so this is hardly the last iteration. If you want to see more technical build details and follow the progress, check out his Instagram @70Hellcat because even though the Challenger will be making 707-plus hp once the bugs are smashed, Larry hinted to us that he's already pondering what he may do next to make it ever faster.

It has one of the nicest interiors in its class, a good list of standard features, and top-notch predicted reliability ratings. Though its performance won't wow you, it has capable engine power and composed handling.	The 2018 Buick Encore ranks among the top subcompact SUVs. It has one of the nicest interiors in its class, a good list of standard features, and top-notch predicted reliability ratings. Though its performance won't wow you, it has capable engine power and composed handling. Is the Buick Encore a Good SUV? The smooth riding Buick Encore is one of the most upscale subcompact SUVs , thanks to quality cabin materials, comfortable seats, and loads of standard equipment. It also boasts great predicted reliability. Although neither engine option is powerful, they are fine for everyday commuting and return good gas mileage. Should I Buy the Buick Encore? Though the Encore is a good SUV, it also has a higher starting price than most competitors. You'd be smart to take a look at some higher-ranked rivals that cost less. The Mazda CX-3 is more fun to drive than the Encore. The Chevy Trax shares the same platform as the Encore, but its cabin quality is a notch below the Buick. The CX-3 and the Trax each cost about $2,000 less than the Encore. Should I Buy a New or Used Buick Encore? Buick didn't make any notable changes to the Encore for 2018, so you may want to consider a nearly identical used 2017 model to save money. Though you could probably save more money by shopping for even older models, the Encore's substantial 2017 refresh makes it a good buy. Changes for the 2017 model year included a revised front-end appearance, a refreshed interior design, available LED headlights, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and a standard 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. To research some other models in this generation, check out our reviews of the 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 Buick Encore .

We Did the Research for You: 40 Reviews Analyzed For our 2018 Buick Encore review, we researched dozens of professional evaluations, along with safety scores, reliability data, and fuel economy estimates, to help you make the best buying decision possible. This 2018 Buick Encore review incorporates applicable research for all model years in this generation, which spans the 2013 through 2018 model years. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News Best Cars has been ranking and reviewing vehicles since 2007, and our team has more than a combined 75 years of experience in the automotive industry. To maintain objectivity, we don't accept incentives or expensive gifts from car companies, and an outside team handles the ads on our site. How Much Does the Buick Encore Cost? The Encore has a base price of around $23,000, which is high for the class. However, the Encore does come with a generous allotment of standard features and a pretty nice interior for a subcompact SUV. There are several higher trims, with the highest (the Encore Premium) starting a bit over $30,000. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Buick dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Buick deals page . Buick Encore Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Buick Encore or Chevrolet Trax? The Chevrolet Trax is essentially a less expensive and less upscale version of the Encore. The Buick has a nicer cabin and more standard features, but both SUVs have the same base engine and similar fuel economy. However, the Encore has an optional engine for more power. The Buick also delivers a smoother ride than its Chevy cousin. If you want a more luxurious SUV, go with the Encore. But for those on a tighter budget, the Trax is an OK choice. Which Is Better: Buick Encore or Mazda CX-3? The Mazda CX-3 has the best all-around performance in this class, thanks to its peppy engine and superb, responsive handling. The ride quality is great too. Inside, the CX-3 has plenty of high-quality materials and comfortable front seats, but the Encore gives you more rear-seat space. The Encore also boasts more cargo room and a longer list of features. Between these two, it comes down to price and personal preference. The Mazda costs about $3,000 less than the Buick, and it's a good fit if you want a sporty driving experience. However, the Encore is the better choice if you prefer more features and more space. Which is Better: Buick Encore or Toyota CH-R? The Toyota CH-R is an all-new vehicle for 2018, but that's all the excitement this bottom-of-the-barrel subcompact SUV brings. Though it comes with lots of standard advanced safety features, it has poor interior quality and little passenger room. The CH-R also has dull performance. If it was much cheaper than most vehicles in the class, we might be able to recommend it, but the CH-R only costs a few hundred less than the Encore. Encore Interior How Many People Does the Encore Seat? The Encore seats five. The front seats are comfortable and provide good driver visibility thanks to a high seating position. The rear seats have a decent amount of headroom and can fit two adults without complaint. Encore and Car Seats The Encore has two full sets of LATCH car-seat connectors. The lower anchors are hard to access because they're set deeply in the seats. The top tether anchors are easier to access. There's not enough room for rear-facing child seats unless the front seats are moved up, leaving less space for front passengers. Encore Interior Quality The Encore's cabin is quiet even at highway speeds, and the quality of materials is pretty high. However, the Buick loses points on style because the dashboard's many buttons give it a cluttered, outdated look. Encore Cargo Space The Encore's cargo hold is pretty typical for the class, and it should meet most needs. It has nearly 19 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, which is enough for more than a dozen full shopping bags. Fold the rear seats down, and you have more than 48 cubic feet of space, which is enough room for most outdoor gear and even some furniture items. A fold-flat front passenger seat allows you to haul very long items as well. Encore Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The Encore comes standard with satellite radio, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and the Buick IntelliLink infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen, Siri Eyes Free, two USB ports, and Bluetooth. The Encore's infotainment system won't give you any headaches; the interface is intuitive and the touch screen is easy to use. Unlike some competitors, this Buick also comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. For more information, read What Is Apple CarPlay? and What Is Android Auto? Then, see the Best Cars With Apple CarPlay and Best Cars With Android Auto . Available features include remote start, a moonroof, and a seven-speaker sound system. Encore Performance Encore Engine: No Speed Demon The Encore has two engine options, but neither is especially impressive. The base engine is a 138-horsepower Ecotec turbocharged four-cylinder that feels strained when carrying a full carload of people. The acceleration also feels sluggish. A 153-horsepower turbocharged engine is also available. Though its performance won't wow anyone, it delivers better acceleration than the base engine. Both engines come with a six-speed automatic transmission. Encore Gas Mileage: Respectable Ratings The Encore earns 27 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway. Those are better ratings than what many other subcompact SUVs get, though they aren't class-leading. The Encore will cost you about $100 less per year in gas money than the Chevrolet Trax, but the Mazda CX-3 will cost you even less than the Buick. Encore Ride and Handling: Great Commuter Vehicle The Encore is a terrific daily driver. It provides a cushioned ride regardless of road quality, and there is little body lean around corners. The Encore's small size makes it agile and maneuverable, which is great in heavy traffic or in tight spaces. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. Encore Reliability Is the Buick Encore Reliable? The 2018 Buick Encore earns an excellent predicted reliability rating of 4.5 out of five from J.D. Power. That's one of the highest ratings in the industry (three is average). Buick Encore Warranty Buick covers the Encore with a four-year/50,000-mile warranty and a six-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. That's a bit better than the warranties offered by many other subcompact SUVs, such as the Honda HR-V and the Mazda CX-3 . Encore Safety Encore Crash Test Results The 2018 Buick Encore earns a five-star overall crash test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Encore the highest rating of Good in all five individual crash evaluations. Encore Safety Features The Encore comes standard with a rearview camera. Available active safety features include rear cross traffic alert, blind spot monitoring, forward collision alert, parking assist, and lane departure warning. Which Buick Encore Model Is Right for Me? There are a half-dozen trim choices with the Encore. While the Encore does come with a generous amount of standard features, the lower trims offer little beyond them. Some of the higher trims are available with more features for not much more money, making them a better value if you have the flexibility in your budget. If you want the most driver assistance features, the Premium is the trim for you; it has active safety tech not offered in any lower trim. For most buyers, one of the middle trims will be a great choice. The Sport Touring and Preferred II trims both have starting prices between $25,500 and $27,000. They come fairly well-equipped and are available with some advanced features, giving you most of the value of the highest trims for a few thousand dollars less. Buick Encore 1SV The base Encore 1SV trim starts around $23,000. The 1SV doesn't offer much beyond the standard features   just a few styling upgrades. Buick Encore Preferred The Encore Preferred has a starting price of around $24,400. It has a few features the base trim doesn't   such as a rear cargo cover   but they aren't really noteworthy. The Preferred is the lowest trim to offer all-wheel drive, which is a $1,500 upgrade. Buick Encore Sport Touring The Encore Sport Touring starts around $25,600. It comes standard with remote start. It's available with the Safety package ($495), which adds rear cross traffic alert and blind spot monitoring. This is the lowest trim to offer the upgraded IntelliLink system with navigation ($495). It's also the lowest trim available with the 153-horsepower engine. It costs about $500 to upgrade to the stronger engine. Buick Encore Preferred II The Encore Preferred II has a starting price around $26,900. Dual-zone automatic climate control, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert all come standard. The Experience Buick package ($2,390) adds a power moonroof and the upgraded infotainment system with navigation. You can also add those features individually if you don't want both. Buick Encore Essence The Encore Essence starts around $29,100. It comes with a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated front seats, and a heated steering wheel. The Experience Buick package is available. Buick Encore Premium The top Encore Premium trim starts around $30,500. It comes with all the features from lower trims and a seven-speaker audio system, forward collision alert, lane departure warning, and parking assist. The Experience Buick package is available. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Buick dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Buick deals page . The Final Call The 2018 Buick Encore is a good little SUV that delivers a fairly upscale interior and lots of standard features. It's also nimble, and the ride is smooth. It's not a perfect SUV; the engines are a bit weak (especially the base engine) and it's more expensive than many competitors. Still, there are a lot of reasons to like the Encore. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis.

BBHLQtE	finance	personalfinance	Best bank account bonuses for May 2020	Walk away with stacks of cash just for opening a checking or savings account.	If you're wishing you had more savings right now, you're not alone. Many Americans impacted by the coronavirus are finding that they need additional funds to make ends meet. A bit of extra cash could be a big help. Fortunately, a number of banks are still giving out free stacks of cash. In exchange for opening a new savings or checking account , you could wind up with an extra $200 or $300 dollars (or more). Shopping around for a new bank account isn't exactly exciting, but at a time like this it could be worth your while. Why banks have sign-up bonuses Banks use sign-up bonuses to distinguish themselves from others in the industry. Cash bonuses also help financial institutions bring in new customers and new deposits. While they could pay account holders a higher yield, for some banks, offering a bonus is preferable. "It's much easier to quantify the bonus than it is to raise the rate on what you're paying out on deposits," says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate chief financial analyst. Some banks, like TD Bank , offer more than one sign-up bonus. But qualifying for multiple bonuses at the same time at the same bank usually isn't possible. Bank account bonuses are typically available only to new checking or savings account holders. What to watch out for Every bank account bonus isn't a good deal . Before you sign up, read the fine print. Watch out for sky-high minimum balance requirements and monthly fees that could eat into your earnings. If earning a bonus seems to require too much effort, you might want to look for another one. If you're applying for a checking account, make sure it's a good match that meets your needs. For example, if you need them, double-check that there are plenty of branches and ATMs in your area. That way, you're not driving miles to meet with a banker or wasting money on out-of-network ATM fees. And with coronavirus forcing banking to shift online more than ever before, look for a bank or credit union that offers a solid set of digital tools . If you're looking for a new savings account , consider whether you're better off finding another bank that pays more interest. "Those types of bonuses are only on accounts that really pay minimal, meaning that you're not going to get that 1.55 percent, right," says Deacon Hayes, founder of the website Well Kept Wallet. "You're probably going to get less than a percent. So you're kind of getting that bonus, but you're sacrificing the long-term return. So you just want to weigh those options." Here are some of the best bank account bonuses in May. Compare these offers along with CDs and other savings accounts that pay more interest . And check out other types of bonuses, too, like the best brokerage account bonuses .

AA2eTBe	health	wellness	The 14 best things you can do for your body	Beyond working out and eating right, 14 habits that will improve your health.	Beyond working out and eating right, 14 habits that will improve your health. Meditate Meditation may seem like a passing trend, but the newly popular practice touts some serious health benefits. Om-ing is optional, but regularly taking 10-20 minutes to unwind and focus on yourself is one of the greatest secrets to longevity. "Meditation is going to help with stress reduction, better sleep, lower blood pressure, improved immunity and improved cardiovascular function," says Kerry Bajaj, a certified health coach at the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in New York City. It's also going to make you feel much better because you're disconnecting from all the stimulation of life. Sleep It's no secret that most hard-working people are sleep deprived, but just because it's common does not mean it's OK. Sleep makes or breaks a healthy lifestyle. All that time and effort you spend eating right and working out won't be as effective -- and your physique will actually be harder to maintain -- if you're not getting seven to eight hours a night. Catching up on sleep on the weekends won't work either.Research from Rochester University suggests that insufficient sleep disrupts our brain's ability to flush toxins from the body and as a result, can impair brain function. So, when you show up for work after a bad night's sleep and you're unable to focus on anything -- that's why. Drink warm water with lemon What you do in the morning sets the tone for the rest of your day, which is why many experts suggest starting off with a big breakfast that's packed with satiating protein and fiber. Though that's a great idea, the first thing you put in your mouth when you wake shouldn't be a vegetable omelet and a side of chicken sausage. Drinking warm water with lemon upon rising delivers loads of benefits. "Warm water with lemon in the morning is very alkalizing. It supports detoxification and even helps to stimulate bowel movements," says Bajaj. It will even give you a nice boost of energy sans caffeine. Drink tea Drink more tea. Just do it. Aside from water, tea might be the best beverage for your body. Research published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that regular consumption of green tea can improve memory and cognition in men. Green tea is also credited with a host of other health-boosting benefits, like firing up your metabolism, lowering blood pressure, preventing bad breath, boosting immunity, and acting as an anti-inflammatory agent. Floss Flossing won't just make your pearly whites brighter, the habit will improve your health on a much deeper level. "If your gums get infected, the bacteria in your mouth can enter the bloodstream and lead to inflammation throughout the body," says Bajaj. Take probiotics Check in with your gut -- a healthy digestive system is often seen as the window to your overall health. One way to boost good gut bacteria and keep things running smoothly: take a daily probiotic supplement. "Probiotics help with digestion, and they're good for your immunity," says Bajaj. "Fixing the balance of good bacteria in the gut can even improve your mood. A lot of our serotonin is actually produced in the gut, so there's a big connection between what's happening in the gut and how we feel." Warm up before workouts Static stretching before a workout doesn't do your body much good. In fact, research from Stephen F. Austin State University found that exercisers who did static stretching before lifting had impaired strength compared to those who performed a dynamic warm-up, a muscle-warming routine that includes moves like walking lunges and high skips. Get in the habit of performing a dynamic warm-up before any kind of workout and you'll not only enhance your performance, but also help prevent injury. Sweat with HIIT According to research from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Birmingham, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can result in the same benefits as those you get from endurance training -- but you'll spend a hell of a lot less time in the gym. While breaking a sweat of any kind is vital, HIIT improves your fitness while also fighting heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. Avoid BPA BPA stands for Bisphenol A, a chemical used to produce many common household products, like water bottles and food cans. In recent years, the compound's effects on health and human development have generated quite a bit of controversy, and for good reason. Research has found links between exposure to BPA and reproductive disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While the FDA reports evidence on both sides of the debate, it's better to be safe than sorry. Purchase typically canned items, like tomatoes, in glass containers instead, and if you're sticking with plastic containers, check for a recycle code of 3 or 7 on the bottom -- those may be made with BPA. Clean up your skincare regimen Your skin is your largest organ, so you've got to take care of it like you would any other part of your body. That means applying sunscreen daily and being picky about the products you use. "Look at your hair and skincare products, and clean up those products so you're not putting chemicals on your skin," advises Bajaj. Check labels for Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Sodium Laureth Sulfate, and toss products that contain these compounds. Sulfates not only strip your hair and skin of necessary moisture and protective barriers, but they also become toxic when combined with other ingredients commonly found in skincare products. Wear sunglasses Slapping on sunscreen is incredibly important when it comes to protecting your skin from the sun's harmful rays. However, it's easy to forget about protecting our eyes. The only way to do so is by wearing sunglasses. Remembering to throw on your shades every day will guard against sunburn, cataracts and even skin cancer. Choose sunglasses with 99-100% UV absorption or UV 400, and maybe draw some inspiration from your girlfriend's oversize shades the bigger the glasses, the better the protection. Get more fiber Fiber is a key component of any healthy diet, and by now we've all learned it doesn't just come from a morning bowl of Wheaties. There's actually very little that fiber can't do. A diet high in fiber will keep your body running smoothly for a long time, really research shows that those who increased their intake actually live longer. What's more, a study published in Nutrition found that fiber may aid weight loss. Shall we go on? Fiber also regulates digestion, has been shown to help moderate inflammation, reduces blood pressure, cuts your risk for diabetes and lowers bad cholesterol. Go green at every meal If you don't have something green on your plate at every meal, you're cheating your body out of essential nutrients. According to the USDA, antioxidant-packed dark leafy greens may be some of the best cancer-preventing foods. They also help with weight management and regulate the digestive system. If you're short on time (or just lazy), try supplementing with a green powder like spirulina. It's a type of green-blue algae that's rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, zinc, iron and beta-carotene. Have more sex You don't need anyone to tell you to have more sex, but it doesn't hurt that research is piling up about the benefits of getting busy. Regular time spent behind closed doors can make you look and feel younger, reduce stress, boost immunity, enhance sleep, protect against prostate cancer and improve cardiovascular health. What's more, a 25-year study from Duke University found that the more sex you have, the longer you'll live. Guys, I think we've discovered the fountain of youth.

AA3fRp5	autos	autosnews	2006 Ford Fusion First Drive	Read this full 2006 Ford Fusion road test & first drive brought to you by the automotive experts at Motor Trend.	Maybe it was the heat, but Ford got out of the competitive passenger-car market kitchen about a decade ago. Its top-selling Taurus outgrew the midsize sedan segment in its third redesign, and the Eurocentric Contour, which entered the lineup about the same time, was considerably smaller than the perennial industry benchmark players (Toyota Camry, Honda Accord). The Contour flopped and faded away after 2000, and the Taurus devolved into a low-profit rental car. Ford's Detroit neighbors haven't exactly been stirring the midsize pot, either, which means the Asian automakers have been gorging themselves on the spoils of a 2.2-million-car market. Ford's product-creation veep Phil Martens had the unenviable task of cutting Ford a healthy slice of that pie, and the Mazda alumnus knew just where to look for a midsize-car platform. "I wanted to use the 6 because [Mazda] builds the best-driving commodity cars and because Mazda is clever with space utilization." The 6's fun-to-drive quotient was deemed crucial because the only chink Ford's market researchers could find in the Asians' impressive armor was their perceived lack of soul. The theory: Come close to matching their virtues--quality, reliability, value, etc.--in a package with spice and sizzle, and the cash registers will cha-ching with conquest customers from coast to coast. Starting with Mazda6 hardware, the sizzle came easy. That car's four-wheel multilink suspension, standard four-wheel disc brakes, and rigid chassis have always delighted us. Ford has further improved the rigidity by 10 percent in bending and torsion to equal the Camry's figures. The Mazda6's 2.3-liter four-cylinder and 3.0-liter Duratec V-6 powertrains haven't prompted much criticism from us, and further tweaking of the V-6's variable cams and intake manifold has upped the torque a skosh from 192 to 205 pound-feet. Icing on the cake: V-6 models come standard with a six-speed automatic transmission--not that we driving enthusiasts wouldn't be delighted if the Mazda6 s's V-6/five-speed- stick combo also were offered (four-cylinder Fusions get a choice of five-speed stick or automatic). All-wheel drive is coming in the fall of 2006, and the green crowd can look forward to a hybrid-powered Fusion arriving sometime in calendar-year 2008. Adding roominess required more effort. The Mazda6 was designed to be a "world car." That's product-planner-speak for "borderline too big in Japan and Europe and slightly snug here in supersize-me-land." So Ford stretched the 6's wheelbase 2.1 inches, added 1.3 inches of much-needed shoulder width, and stood its swoopy greenhouse up a bit. The roofline now affords 0.7 inch more rear headroom, and all the side glass was tilted outboard at the top for an airier, more open feeling. Rear legroom is up only a half inch relative to the Mazda6's, and most dimensions still measure smaller than those of an Accord or Camry, but a high-off-the-floor seat, abundant foot-room under the front seats, and the openness afforded by excellent visibility conspire to give a convincing illusion that this is a big back seat, comfy and supportive enough for long-distance travel. Standard tilt/telescope steering and seat-height adjustment mean that any driver can quickly tailor an ideal driving position. Refreshingly logical controls are within easy reach, and the fit, finish, and build quality of the dash and door trim appear to meet or exceed the Honda standard, with the exception of a wavy passenger airbag cover (this may have been an early build issue). The trunk also expands to a useable, rectangular 15.8 cubic feet, with no intrusive hinges and standard 60/40 seatbacks that fall flat when their trunk-mounted levers are pulled. No one can comment on an all-new car's quality, reliability, and resale value after a two-day test drive, but Martens claims that the Hermosillo, Mexico, plant that'll build the Fusion (and its sisterships Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr) consistently ranks at the top of Ford's internal quality ratings. His team also reckons that if 85-plus percent of all Fusions sell to regular folks (rather than fleets) as planned, the resale value should mirror that of the Five Hundred. That would put the value at 43 percent after three years, according to the Automotive Lease Guide projections. (By comparison, an Accord is worth 49 percent, and a Taurus is down to 28.) So will the Fusion and its siblings connect with buyers strongly enough to sell 300,000 cars per year (the plant capacity), single-handedly bumping Ford's market share up a point and making Martens a hero? At the risk of making one of those bold prognostications that future generations will recall with eye-rolling sarcasm--yes. At least "yes" if 300,000 prospects can be offered a test drive along 125 miles of tortuous, hilly, twisty, bumpy North Carolina back roads. The Fusion demonstrates remarkable poise on such roads, the structure absorbing every impact with no reverberations or aftershocks. Ride motions are well controlled with minimal harshness, and the noise associated with bump impacts is well muffled, which always makes a car seem like it rides better than it does. In short, the car behaves like an Accord does when pushed hard. The big difference between the Fusion and the Accord is that the Fusion behaves as though it enjoys this; to egg its driver on to miscreant behavior. The Accord may perform equally well (probably better in a straight line, thanks to an extra 19 horsepower), but it always seems to go about such tasks with dogged resignation. Its muzzled motor mutters, "Where's the fire?" while the Fusion's engine eagerly snarls for more, without shouting down the occupants (it's tuned quieter than in the Mazda6). The top SEL model gets 225/50R17 Michelins that bite the road hard, even when the tentacles of Hurricane Dennis are lashing it, and the suspension system delivers solid linear steering response. From turn-in to apex to exit, no mid-curve corrections are needed. Disc brakes with optional ABS stop reassuringly, though the pedal could be firmer. Base S and SE models get 16-inch footwear. One complaint: Although the Aisin Warner tranny offers six ratios, the driver can choose only between "D" and "L." In low mode, the transmission tends to stay in the lowest possible gear and will perform downshifts at inopportune times, like in the middle of a corner. Left in "drive," the transmission is overeager to select the highest possible gear at all times, bringing unwanted upshifts when lifting mid-corner, followed by multiple downshifts seconds later when powering out of a turn. A more extensive gate is needed, or maybe a "sport" mode or adaptive shift logic that senses enthusiastic driving and holds lower gears longer. Reprogramming the software could improve driveability significantly, and we hope Ford is already at work on a fix. Another oversight: While Ford offers world-class passive safety gear, including optional curtain and side-impact airbags, stability control isn't available on any Fusion. Pull off the twisties and onto an Interstate, and the Fusion proves as pleasing to the flustered passengers as it's been to the ardent driver. Extensive tuning in the acoustic wind tunnel has hushed wind noise to below the level of the (also quite tolerable) tire sizzle and road noise. Ford claims best-in-class interior sound levels, and passengers can indeed converse using their "inside voice" comfortably at 80 mph. Package all the above in an aggressive and distinctive wrapper, and the Fusion begins to look like a tempting midsize sedan. Hang window-sticker pricing on it that starts below that of a Hyundai Sonata ($17,995) and maintains a price gap of a thousand dollars or more relative to the Japanese blue-chippers all the way up the price ladder, and Ford would seem to have earned itself a taste-test from even the most discerning midsize-sedan connoisseurs. Bon appétit! 2006 Ford Fusion SEL V-6 Base price $22,360 Vehicle layout Front engine, FWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan Engine 3.0 L/221 hp/205 lb-ft DOHC 24-valve V-6 Transmission 6-speed automatic Curb weight 3300 lb (mfr) Wheelbase 107.4 in Length x Width x Height 190.2 x 72.2 x 55.8 in 0-60 mph 8.5 sec (mfr est) EPA city/hwy fuel econ 21 / 29 mpg On sale in U.S. Currently Secret Weapon Ford is simultaneously launching the NASCAR version of its new Fusion this fall. Other than applying new grille, headlamp, and taillamp decals, the Fusion racer varies little from its Taurus predecessor. All the running gear carries over, but a few bumps and tweaks to the nose trade off a smidgen of downforce for slightly improved drag. NASCAR fans pay close attention to such changes, however, which should help Ford get the word out about the civilian version. Ford won't divulge what it spends each year on stock-car racing, so it's impossible to compare with the budget for more conventional advertising, but marketing research indicates racing provides an impressive return on investment. These racing fanatics are an incredibly loyal bunch. Ford's market share among race fans is 40-percent higher than its current 17-percent share of the total market, and race fans are 47 percent more likely to consider buying a Ford, according to company research. NASCAR fans also consistently rate Ford higher than does the public at large on such attributes as "holds up well," "smart designs," and "practical innovations."

Look back at her evolution from child actress to troubled starlet to fashion school student and beyond in the photo gallery below. Amanda Bynes Through the Years Amanda Bynes has had a roller coaster ride in Hollywood since she first rose to fame as a cast member on Nickelodeon's All That . In honor of her return to Twitter , look back at her evolution from child actress to troubled starlet to fashion school student in the photo gallery below. All That "When I was 7, I started taking a comedy class for kids at the Comedy Store in Hollywood," Amanda Bynes told the Los Angeles Times . She was discovered two years later while taking classes at the Laugh Factory. In 1996, Bynes joined the cast of Nickelodeon's sketch comedy series All That . The Amanda Show The All That scene stealer got her own series, The Amanda Show , in 1999. Bynes won the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award for Favorite TV Actress three years in a row. During that time, Bynes dated her costar (and future Saturday Night Live cast member) Taran Killam . Big Fat Liar The actress made her feature film debut in 2002's Big Fat Liar , costarring Frankie Muniz . The movie, also starring Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh , earned an impressive $48 million domestically. What I Like About You From 2002 to 2006, Bynes played Jennie Garth 's teenage sister on the WB sitcom. What I Like About You became the top-rated show in its time slot among women in the 18-to-34 age group. After her breakup with Taran Killam , Bynes began dating costar Nick Zano , who "helped me get back to where I was," the actress later told CosmoGirl! magazine. Teen Queens Bynes   who's won six Nickeloden Kids' Choice Awards   posed with Lindsay Lohan in April 2004. Years later, the redheaded star would criticize Bynes for not receiving a harsher punishment after being arrested for similar automobile-related offences. "Why did I get put in jail and a Nickelodeon star has had no punishments so far?" Lohan asked via Twitter. She's The Man In the 2006 movie, Bynes' character dressed up as a boy so she could play soccer. "I enjoy doing things that are scary or things that some girls might not like because it won't let them look gorgeous," the actress told CosmoGirl! magazine. "Every day they'd pin my hair back and I'd have no makeup. That's when you start relying more on your sense of humor." She's the Man , costarring Channing Tatum , grossed more than $57 million worldwide. Hairspray Bynes played sheltered teen Penny Lou Pingleton in the 2007 remake of the '80s movie musical. The film, costarring Allison Janney , Zac Efron , Queen Latifah , John Travolta , Michelle Pfeiffer , Brittany Snow and Nikki Blonsky , grossed more than $118 million. Later that year, Bynes created a clothing line for Steve & Barry's, called Dear by Amanda Bynes. Packing on the PDA In 2008, the actress began dating Hills reality star Doug Reinhardt . "Most guys I've dated started as friends," she later told Maxim . "Treat me like a friend and maybe you can become a boyfriend." By year's end, a source told Us Weekly Bynes dumped Reinhardt for exploiting her celebrity status. Reinhardt fired back, claiming the actress "wouldn't even let me have a guys' night out without flipping out on me." Good Girl Gone Bad The actress shed her clothes   and her inhibitions   when she appeared on the February 2010 cover of Maxim . "Some people still see me as a kid, but I'm a 23-year-old woman now," she told the magazine. "I mean, I'm not gonna do porn, but if it's a Leonardo DiCaprio movie or whatever…Point is, it's time for me to start making my own decisions." Easy A In 2010, Bynes announced her early retirement from show business. "Being an actress isn't as fun as it may seem," she tweeted. "I know 24 is a young age to retire, but you heard it here first: I've retired." Weeks later, the star changed her mind, tweeting, "I've unretired." Bynes then posted a link to the trailer for the movie Easy A , in which she played a self-righteous high school student opposite Emma Stone , Penn Badgley and Aly Michalka . Bumpy Road Ahead The actress was arrested on suspicion of DUI in April 2012 and formally charged two months later. She pleaded not guilty and reached out to Barack Obama on Tuesday for help in her case. "I don't drink," Bynes told the U.S. President via Twitter. "Please fire the cop who arrested me. I also don't hit and run. The end." Living on the Edge The Sydney White actress was officially charged with two misdemeanor counts of hit-and-run in September 2012. The actress was soon seen driving with a suspended license in Hollywood, prompting police officers to pull her over. After a 25-minute conversation, Bynes was allowed to go home. Arrested, Again In May 2013, at the height of her very public meltdown   during which she posted several troubling tweets and exhibited increasingly erratic behavior   Bynes was arrested for allegedly throwing a bong out the window of her New York City high-rise. After undergoing a psych evaluation, she was booked at Midtown Precinct North station for marijuana possession, reckless endangerment, and tampering with evidence. Wigging Out As Bynes' mental and emotional state deteriorated, she began wearing colored wigs while out and about in New York. This blue one was part of her ensemble for a June 2013 court appearance related to her May 2013 arrest. Within a few weeks after this photo was taken, she had been hospitalized on a 5150 psychiatric hold for setting a fire in a stranger's driveway in her hometown of Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was released from rehab five months later, in December 2013. Healthy and Happy Post-rehab, the What a Girl Wants actress moved back in with her parents and began the task of resuming a normal life. In the weeks after she was released, she was spotted taking walks with her family and hitting the gym. She also enrolled as a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandise in L.A. On March 21, she shared this picture of herself   looking happier and healthier than she had in months   at the school's debut runway show. Showing Skin Bynes turned heads with a lacy dress and a platinum hair color during a rare night out on July 23, 2015, hitting up fashion designer Michael Costello and Style PR's capsule collection launch party in Los Angeles. "Amanda is doing great," an attorney of hers told Us Weekly the previous month. "She appreciates all of the love and support she receives from family, friends, and fans." Short Hair, Don't Care Weeks before turning 30, Bynes returned to Twitter to post a selfie showing off her a shorter haircut, opting for shoulder-length locks and side-swept bangs. "What do you think?" the former child star asked her subscribers. Back in the Press The actress sat down for her first interview in four years on June 9, 2017, talking to Hollyscoop 's Diana Madison about her appreciation of Nick Cannon , her adoration of Blac Chyna , her love for spinning and her infamous 2013 Drake tweet. "I was, like, saying, 'Murder my vagina,'" she recalled. "I was serious, but I was also on drugs, so that was my way of saying like, 'Let's do it, man.' … It just means, like, 'F k me, Drake!'" Preparing for a Comeback A source told Us Weekly on February 11, 2018, that the Easy A alum was " excited about the next chapter of her professional life " and getting ready to make a Hollywood comeback. "Amanda will make it a reality," the insider added. "2018 is going to be Amanda's triumphant return!" Two months later, Bynes attended a fundraiser for California politician Pat Harris' United States Senate bid, after which a source informed Us that the actress is " doing really well and basically just living her life" and is "on track to graduate from fashion school this summer." Open and Honest Bynes revealed her struggle with drugs, depression and more during a November 2018 interview for Paper magazine's cover story. As for her head turning social media comments over the years, the retired actress told the publication: "I'm really ashamed and embarrassed with the things I said. I can't turn back time but if I could, I would. And I'm so sorry to whoever I hurt and whoever I lied about because it truly eats away at me. It makes me feel so horrible and sick to my stomach and sad. Everything I worked my whole life to achieve, I kind of ruined it all through Twitter. It's definitely not Twitter's fault   it's my own fault." Off the Grid A source told Us in December 2018 that the former Nickelodeon star was feeling better than she had been in some time. " Amanda is doing so well , and is truly in the best place she has ever been in," the source told Us at the time. "A component of Amanda's happiness is her decision to severely limit social media activity." Feeling the Pressure Us confirmed in February 2019 that the She's the Man star was seeking treatment in January after reliving her days in the public eye. " Amanda went to rehab … after suffering a setback which was the result of feeling pressure of being back in the spotlight after her Paper magazine cover," an insider told Us . "Amanda is continuing treatment with the assistance of mental health counselors and addiction specialists." Fashion School Graduate The retired actress graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in June 2019. A source told Us at the time that Bynes was given a "day pass" from treatment to attend the ceremony. "Amanda's doctors don't have a timeline as to when she will be released," the insider noted. Welcome to Instagram The former child star joined Instagram on September 10, 2019, debuting pink locks as her first photo. "Hey guys! I'm on Instagram now," she wrote at the time, while she was living in a sober living facility. "Check me out." Green Girl After a three-month hiatus, Bynes retuned to Instagram on December 3, 2019. "Geisha girl vibes :love_letter:," the former Nickelodeon star captioned her comeback snap. The same month, Us confirmed that the actress had left her sober living facility. "Amanda has never been lost or missing," a source told Us at the time. "She did leave the sober living facility but her parents know where she is. With Amanda, it's not surprising that she would leave the sober living facility. It's not uncommon for anyone dealing with sobriety and mental health issues." Engaged! On February 14, 2020, the Easy A actress announced her engagement via Instagram. "Engaged to tha love of my life," she captioned the photo of her diamond ring. A few hours later she shared a photo of her man with her followers, but she didn't reveal his name. Us later identified him as Paul Michael. Future in Fashion The FIDM graduate announced via an Instagram video on February 20, 2020, that she is creating her own clothing line. "I'm really looking forward to starting my clothing line and I'm hoping that in the near future it will be out online," she said. On and Off Bynes and Michael split on March 8, 2020, just three weeks after announcing their engagement. Two days later, the All That alum revealed that she had reunited with her ex. "My love," she captioned a selfie with Michael along with a black heart emoji. Bundle of Joy Michael announced that he and Bynes are expecting their first child together with two Instagram photos posted on March 17, 2020. "Baby in the making," he wrote alongside a selfie with Bynes. He later shared a second photo of a baby's ultrasound, which displayed Bynes' name on the image. Self-Care Bynes' lawyer, David Esquibias, confirmed to Us on March 18, 2020, that the actress is seeking professional care for her "ongoing mental health issues." The attorney added, "Any reports that Amanda is suffering from drug or alcohol addiction issues are completely false. We ask for privacy during this time, and for any speculation about her personal life from the public and the media to cease so Amanda can focus on getting better."
AA3gf2C	autos	autosnews	2004 Pontiac Bonneville GXP First Look	Pop the hood of the new 2004 Pontiac Bonneville GXP, and you'll see that before you lies the handiwork of the General Motors Performance Division (GMPD). Read the full first look article from the experts at Motor Trend.	Pop the hood of the new Bonneville GXP, and you'll see two important badges. The first denotes that before you lies the handiwork of the General Motors Performance Division (GMPD). The second proclaims "Northstar," as in the same 4.6-liter, DOHC aluminum V-8 that powers several Cadillacs. Detuned to a rated 275 horsepower for this Pontiac-branded application, it's a Caddy motor, plain and simple. The new GXP label will now signify hotted-up Pontiacs, much as AMG does for Mercedes-Benz. Along with the engine swap come new fascias and lower bodywork, replacing the usual ribbed, overstated plastic. The more mature look is further enhanced by beefy, 18-inch five-spoke alloys. The suspension has been recalibrated for better handling, including DeCarbon gas shocks and even a strut tower brace, although the ride remains comfortably compliant. Braking is augmented by large four-wheel discs, vented up front. Inside, faux carbon fiber and a few bits of metalook plastic help modernize the overly busy cabin. In spite of its aging platform, numbish Magnasteer, yestertech four-speed automatic transaxle, and plebian front-drive, the GXP is good fun to drive. It'll move five passengers in fast comfort all day long. The engine burbles happily through its quad-tipped exhaust, and the aggressive 3.7:1 final-drive ratio helps the Northstar launch the car with authority. A bargain-priced E55? Hardly, but an honest attempt by Pontiac to make good on its "we build excitement" claims.

It's not a permanent circuit, but it might have the most colorful history of any track in the world. See the original post on Youtube Isle of Man Mountain Course Like Monaco, the Isle of Man mountain course isn't a race track year-round. It's made up of a loop of roads around the Isle of Man, and plays host to the TT every year. It's proven to be one of the most deadly venues of any motorsport event on the continent, but makes for some seriously compelling racing . Red Bull Ring The Red Bull Ring, also known as the A1-Ring and Österrechring, has hosted the Austrian Grand Prix for the past few years after F1 left the circuit in 2003. In addition to Formula 1, the circuit also hosts DTM and MotoGP. See the original post on Youtube Nürburgring Mention the Nürburgring to any true enthusiast, and their eyes will light up. It's known as the Green Hell, thanks to its challenging nature and dangerously small runoffs.

It's a good off-roader with a terrific predicted reliability rating, but it's just not as practical, comfortable, or capable for daily driving as many of its classmates.	The 2018 Lexus GX 460 finishes near the bottom of our luxury midsize SUV rankings. It's a good off-roader with a terrific predicted reliability rating, but it's just not as practical, comfortable, or capable for daily driving as many of its classmates. The 2018 Lexus GX is ranked: #19 in 2018 Luxury Midsize SUVs #20 in Used Luxury Midsize SUVs $40K and up Is the 2018 Lexus GX a Good Used SUV? The 2018 Lexus GX is OK, but there are better options in the luxury midsize SUV class . The GX's off-road abilities are superior to most of its rivals, with trail-ready features that include crawl control and a locking center differential. However, that's the only area where this Lexus really stands out in any positive way. The 2018 GX has several main selling points: Though, its shortcomings are notable: Why You Can Trust Us Our reviews include far more than just one person's opinion. We've analyzed 41 Lexus GX reviews, as well as hard data points like reliability scores and cost of ownership estimates, to help you make the best car-buying decision possible. The U.S. News Best Cars team has been ranking cars, trucks, and SUVs since 2007, and our staff has more than 75 years of combined automotive industry experience. To ensure our impartiality, we never accept expensive gifts or trips from car companies, and an outside team handles the advertising on our site. How Much Is the 2018 Lexus GX? Based on listings for 2018 Lexus GX on our site, the average list price is $49,600. Prices range from $45,000 to $58,000 and vary depending on the vehicle's condition, mileage, features, and location. How Much Does the 2018 Lexus GX Cost to Own? The 2018 GX's five-year costs for gas, insurance, repairs, and maintenance are projected to be around $33,800, or $6,760 per year. That's a little above average for a luxury midsize SUV . Is It Better to Buy a Used or New GX? The 2019 Lexus GX is nearly identical to the 2018 model. You can spend thousands less and get the same basic SUV by purchasing a 2018 GX instead. Since the second-generation GX arrived for 2010, there have been only small changes throughout the years. For 2014, Lexus refreshed the GX's exterior styling and gave it a new infotainment system. Siri Eyes Free connectivity became standard for 2015, and second-row captain's chairs became available for 2017. How Reliable Is the 2018 Lexus GX? The 2018 Lexus GX gets a stellar predicted reliability rating of 4.5 out of five from J.D. Power. 2018 Lexus GX Recalls At the time of writing, one safety recall has been issued for the 2018 Lexus GX: Before buying any used vehicle, make sure all recalls have been addressed. See more information on Lexus GX safety recalls » Which Used Lexus GX Trim Is Right for Me? The 2018 Lexus GX comes in three trims: base, Premium, and Luxury. Every 2018 GX 460 comes with a 4.6-liter V8 engine, a six-speed automatic, and four-wheel drive. The base GX comes well-equipped, so many buyers will probably like it just fine. You can step up to the midlevel Premium trim if you want more comfort and convenience features. For the most driver assistance aids, you'll have to look for the top-of-the-line Luxury trim. {"type":"[CPO-Warranty-Text]"} How Safe Is the GX? Neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have put the 2018 GX through any crash tests. However, the IIHS did give properly equipped GX models the lowest rating of Basic for front crash prevention. Standard advanced safety features: Available advanced safety features: 2018 Lexus GX Versus the Competition Which Is Better: 2018 Lexus GX or 2018 Lexus RX 350? The 2018 Lexus RX 350 finishes much higher in our luxury midsize SUV rankings than the GX, and with good reason. The RX rides smoothly, and it features a well-appointed cabin with comfortable seats. It gets much better fuel economy ratings than the GX, and its V6 engine packs ample punch. The only real reason to choose the GX over the RX is if you place a high priority on off-road capability. Which Is Better: 2018 Lexus GX or 2018 Acura MDX? The 2018 Acura MDX gets a much lower predicted reliability rating than the GX, but it still finishes higher in our rankings. The Acura has a softer ride and provides more cargo space than its Lexus rival. The MDX's standard features list includes leather upholstery, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto, none of which come standard in the GX (some aren't available at all). As with the RX 350, unless you need the GX's off-road chops, the MDX is the better choice. 2018 GX Performance How Does the 2018 Lexus GX Drive? The Lexus GX 460 delivers adequate acceleration with its V8. However, the engine can feel strained at times, and the transmission sometimes hesitates to downshift. The GX rides firmly, leaving some wishing for more smoothness. Where the GX does shine is in off-road situations. It can traverse terrain that many class rivals would find too daunting. In that regard, the stiff suspension is a plus. The GX provides 8.1 inches of ground clearance, and it has off-road features like a locking center differential, crawl control, and a torque-adjustment feature that is incorporated in the four-wheel-drive system to further improve traction. Does the 2018 Lexus GX Get Good Gas Mileage? The GX 460 will have you spending more time at the fuel pump than most other vehicles, regardless of class. 2018 Lexus GX Towing Capacity The GX can tow up to 6,500 pounds when properly equipped. 2018 GX Interior How Many People Does the 2018 GX Seat? The 2018 GX seats seven people in three rows. Available second-row captain's chairs drop the seating capacity to six. The front seats provide the most space and comfort. The second-row seats slide and recline, but they lack adequate support for long drives. Third-row passengers will feel cramped on drives of any length. Standard seating features: Available seating features: How Many Car Seats Fit in the 2018 Lexus GX? The 2018 GX has two complete sets of LATCH car-seat connectors on the middle-row outboard seats and an upper tether on the second-row middle seat. The system earns the second-highest rating of Acceptable for ease of use from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety because the lower anchors are set too deep in the seat. 2018 Lexus GX Features The GX's infotainment system is fairly intuitive, which makes it easy to use. However, redundant physical controls litter the center stack, giving it a cluttered look. The system also feels outdated when compared to more modern infotainment setups found in rivals. 2018 Lexus GX Dimensions Lexus GX Cargo Space The GX 460 has a maximum cargo capacity of just 64.7 cubic feet, which is less space than most luxury midsize SUVs provide. With all seats in use, there's very little room behind the third row. The flip-up rear window makes it easy to load smaller items without opening the tailgate. To open the back, swing the tailgate to the side (as opposed to vertically, as with most SUVs), which can create a major obstacle when loading or unloading cargo. These cargo dimensions are for comparative purposes. There is no substitute for visually examining the storage area in any car you're considering. 2018 Lexus GX Length and Weight Where Was the 2018 Lexus GX Built? Lexus built the GX in Japan.

AA3hFc6	autos	autosnews	2013 Hyundai Sonata	The 2013 Hyundai Sonata has a panorama sunroof, which was previously standard on Limited models, is now an option to reduce costs.	The 2013 Hyundai Sonata is Hyundai's midsize sedan and is considered one of the most stylish offerings in its segment, featuring a dramatic mix of lines, curves, and creases at almost every angle that Hyundai refers to as "fluidic sculpture." But there has been less praise about the Sonata's interior. During our late-2012 comparison involving the Sonata GLS, Toyota Camry LE, and Volkswagen Passat, we noted the Hyundai "felt noticeably tighter inside" and "the hardest to get in and out of (watch your head!) and the least coddling on our backsides." The base model Sonata GLS is powered by a 198-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic. The SE and Limited models use the same engine, but get a slight power bump to 200 hp. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four cylinder produces 198 hp and is available on the SE 2.0T and Limited 2.0T models, leading to fairly quick 0-60 mph times in the 6-second range during our testing. But the turbocharged powertrain wasn't enough for the Sonata SE 2.0T to take top honors in a late-2011 three-way comparison with the Camry SE V-6 and Passat VR6 SEL (the Hyundai placed last). "In real-world duties, the 2.0-liter turbo felt plenty powerful and torquey," we noted. "The ride, while not as compliant as the Passat's, was quiet and comfortable, if a bit too busy for our tastes." The 2013 Sonata is also offered with a hybrid powertrain that combines a 166-hp, 2.4-liter four cylinder gas engine with a 40-hp electric motor that returns an EPA estimated 35/40 mpg city/highway. Regardless of trim, standard features include Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, split fold-down rear seats, and steering wheel-mounted audio control buttons. Higher trim levels include notable features like heated front and rear seats, HD radio, and leather seats. New for 2013 The 2013 Hyundai Sonata's panorama sunroof, which was previously standard on Limited models, is now an option to reduce costs. The six-speed manual has been dropped and heated rear seats and navigation are available as options.

AAA0qq0	finance	personalfinance	Are these 8 costly car repairs worth the money?	Here are some cheaper solutions to expensive auto problems.	Here are some cheaper solutions to expensive auto problems. Are these 8 costly car repairs worth the money? There are two types of car repairs: the ones that are frustrating and costly and the ones that induce terror and panic. From engine problems to worn-out clutches, some repairs are so costly that they make you question whether it's even worth putting that much money into the car   if you can even come up with the cash. The good news is that there's often an alternative to some of the costliest repairs. Click through and learn what to do about your car repairs. Repair: Busted Cylinder Cylinders, which house pistons, are located in the engine block. When a cylinder goes, your car becomes expensive and immovable . Because disassembling the engine and putting it back together is tedious and time-consuming, replacing a cylinder can cost as much as $8,000, making it one of the most expensive repairs and one that, particularly on older cars, is rarely worth the investment. Alternative: Replace the Whole Engine You don't need to buy a new car if you have a busted cylinder. But, in most cases, it will cost between $3,000 and $10,000 to replace the entire engine, which gives you a brand-new set of cylinders and pistons instead of just a replacement for the one that broke. An engine swap will likely be cheaper and simpler than replacing a single cylinder. Even if it's not, a brand-new engine gives you so much more for a comparable price. Repair: Clutch Replacement Unless you regularly tow heavy loads or put other undue strain on your vehicle, your clutch should last for at least 50,000 miles   as many as 100,000 miles on some newer cars . When the clutch finally does give out, however, it can be an expensive repair. The average replacement is $732, although that number could soar to four digits. Alternative: Don't Ride the Clutch There's no simple alternative to replacing a blown clutch, but in this case, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. When driving a stick, your behavior can mean the difference between tens of thousands of miles on the life of your clutch. A fully depressed clutch doesn't harm the car, nor does a clutch that's fully released. But "riding" the clutch   keeping some pressure on it while in traffic or on a hill   creates unnecessary wear on the clutch pads, which can contribute to an early clutch death. See Also: 20 Most Expensive Cars to Insure Repair: Blown Head Gasket Head gaskets create a barrier seal between the cylinder head and engine block. This barrier is critical to preventing water, oil, coolant and gases from leaving the engine. When they go, it's ugly. Average costs for replacing a head gasket will rarely cost less than $700 and in the worst cases can crawl past $2,000. Alternative: Buy DIY Sealant When your car is overheating, has low coolant levels or you see white smoke pouring from your exhaust, you likely need a head gasket repair. The good news is that companies like Blue Devil sell liquid sealants that anyone of any skill level can pour directly into their car's radiator. The fix is permanent, and it will run you only about $35. Related: 10 Things to Do When Shopping for a Used Car Repair: Bad Catalytic Converter When your check engine light comes on, your exhaust smells odd or your vehicle fails an emissions test, chances are good you've got a bad catalytic converter. Catalytic converters   aka cats   are environmentally friendly devices that filter exhaust and convert harmful gases into less harmful gases, like carbon dioxide. Replacing expensive cats, which contain precious metals like gold and palladium, can cost between $1,700 and $1,900. Alternative: Take Steps to Make It Last Like so many systems that are designed to last the life of the car, prevention is the best medicine for catalytic converters. Go slow over speed bumps, make sure not to drive over curbs out of parking lots and otherwise avoid bumping the underside of your vehicle. Also, don't drive through deep puddles or piled snow. It's also critical to use the right fuel   using cheaper gas than your car requires can easily clog your cat. Finally, don't ever bump-start or tow-start your car, which injects unburned fuel into the cat. Learn: The Costly Effects the Weather Has on Your Car Repair: Bad Alternator One of the hardest-working parts in your car   your alternator   is a built-in charger tasked with both charging the battery and supplying power to the car's electrical system as the engine is running. When yours goes kaput, you can expect to spend anywhere from the low-$300s to the low-$800s to replace it. Alternative: Buy Refurbished Alternator Unlike catalytic converters   which by law must be replaced with new, like-for-like parts in many cases   alternators don't have to be new. Opting for a refurbished or remanufactured alternator can save you a bundle of money over buying the part new. Even better, a well-built refurbished alternator won't suffer a decline in performance, and the warranty is often the same as a new version of the same part. Repair: Spent Fuel Injectors Cars became far more efficient when modern fuel-injection systems replaced the clunky carburetors of old. Fuel injectors are spray nozzles that can easily become clogged and require cleaning or replacing. There are repair kits designed for DIY types of people to clean these delicate, critical parts themselves, but that's rarely a good idea. Replacing them can cost between $600 and $1,700. Alternative: Change Spark Plugs Fuel injectors, which dispense a precise amount of gasoline to the engine, can last the life of the car if you take preventative measures. The first steps to preserving your injectors are to change your oil and air filters on schedule   but those basic steps are critical to many of your car's systems. What often gets overlooked are spark plugs. Cheap and DIYable in many cases, changing old, worn spark plugs can prevent the buildup of soot and residue that is responsible for the downfall of so many fuel injectors. Repair: Blown Starter The sinking feeling of turning your key in the ignition switch only to have nothing happen can often be traced to your starter. When that's the case, you could wind up paying more than $600 to replace the little flywheel whose only job is to launch the ignition process. Alternative: Check the Battery Instead Starter problems are easy to misdiagnose. The intermittent starting problems, dim interior lights and other warning signs of a bad starter are identical to the warning signs of a bad battery, which is a whole lot cheaper to replace. Before you go ahead with starter surgery, check   or ask your mechanic to check   the battery and charging system first. Repair: Hybrid Battery Replacement The benefits of modern, reliable hybrid cars are many   not the least of which is that they gobble up far less fuel, dramatically reducing the long-term cost of ownership and also reducing emissions. The problem is, if a hybrid battery goes, you're going to spend a whole lot more to replace it than you would have on a standard combustion engine   as much as $4,000 to $6,000. Alternative: Shop the Warranties New hybrid batteries come with crushing price tags that rival even the dreaded transmission repair. The good news is that most states require manufacturers to warranty them for eight years/80,000 miles, with some states requiring even more. That doesn't mean you should have to spend all the gas money you saved for a $5,000 battery when your car is still in five-digit mile territory. When buying a new car, shop for a hybrid with a warranty that goes above and beyond what the law requires. Hyundai, for example, warranties its hybrid batteries for life.

If you talk about your husband in a degrading way to your friends, complain about him in a group, or call him out in public for something that can be handled privately, it s indicative that you need to handle something bigger in private.

Money actually, the lack thereof puts major stress on a marriage, and without a clear plan, it s easy for animosity and resentment to build up. Together, my husband and I paid off more than $127K in four years. I m not sure where our marriage would be right now if we were still entrenched in so much debt.    Cherie Lowe, 35, Greenwood, IN, married 14 years Welcome Each Other Home With a Kiss "We do it every night. Then we sit on the couch with no distractions no TV, dinner, kids, or dogs. Sometimes we'll have a glass of wine as we talk about our days, our challenges, our ideas, everything that's going on that might be joyous, exciting, distracting, or causing stress. It might take a few minutes; it might take a few hours. That way, if there's anything going on that might disrupt our relationship, we get it out in the open, address it, and move on to the rest of our evening."   Sandhi Schimmel Gold, 58, South Chesterfield, VA, married 10 years Love Can Heal Many Wounds "I once got really upset with my husband, which resulted in me crying so hard that he didn't know what to say or do. He got very quiet and tried to comfort me, but my response was something like, 'Well, that's all fine now, but what happens when this wound re-opens and I get angry like this again?' That's when he made his best statement of all time: 'Then we will just have to pour some love into it. The wound may not go away, but we will keep pouring love into it until it gets smaller and smaller.' Ever since that day, that's what we've done."   Maggie Reyes, 40, Miami Springs, FL, married six years Lists Aren't Just for To-Dos "When we get married, many of us expect that since we love each other, our relationships will need little to no work. However, there are almost certainly times when we don't like each other. During our rough patch, my husband and I made lists of the things we loved about each other, like 'I love the way you parent our children,' or 'I love the way you look when you are sleeping.' They served as reminders of the good stuff we chose to focus on the positive. I think it saved our marriage."   Kim Boerman, 46, Charleston, SC, married 22 years It's Time for Your Annual Review "Every January, my husband and I have a meeting about what we want to do that year and how will it affect our family. It's helped us narrow down some major life decisions, like moving to a new state. It also allows us to dream a little. The excitement over checking things off of our life bucket lists, like having a kid, going back to school, and buying our first house, has made us so much closer."   Nikki Wallace Wilson, 31, Dallas, married eight years Don't Sweat (or Smell) the Small Stuff "If you find his socks on the floor, fight the instinct to smell them to determine if they are clean. This could be fatal. Instead, be thankful for your husband and throw the socks in the hamper. Use the moment to remember that we all have imperfections. He's overlooking some of yours too."   Liz Rampy, 38, Easley, SC, married 15 years Be Friends First and Spouses Second "I have suffered from mental illness, including two years of severe depression. During that time, I shut down and shut people out, including those closest to me. I was not able to be the wife or mom I wanted to be, or that I thought my husband deserved. If we didn't have the foundation of friendship that we do, we wouldn't have made it through."   Danielle Hark, 33, Millburn, NJ, married seven years Don't Be Afraid of a Little PDA "Show how much you love your husband by kissing his hand, rubbing his shoulders, or putting your hands on one another's knee. You don't have to force it or be overly affectionate, but showing love outside of the house reinforces a natural part of marriage. Plus, it has the potential to be a super-sexy, amazingly playful preview of what will happen at home!"   Stephanie Freeman, 44, Raleigh, NC, married 19 years Being Right is Overrated "Early on in my marriage, I refused to admit I was wrong. My husband and I argued over the silliest little things, like the best way to get to the store or the right way to load the dishwasher. But I realized that by always insisting that I was right, I was causing avoidable and pointless fights. Now I ask myself, Is this really worth it? And most times, it's not. Picking my battles has made my husband listen more, because he knows I don't disagree over everything. So let your husband do things his way sometimes. You're better off supporting his decision and, if it's wrong, learning from it."   Cari Andreani, 40, Jacksonville, FL, married 17 years
AArWO54	autos	autosluxury	2017 Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe	Four-door coupe, SUV, or sports sedan? Yes!	Now that the crossover has become the de facto American family car, what's an enthusiast to do? Stick with a ground-hugging sports sedan or cave and join the hordes commuting in their skyscraping SUVs? Is it time to trade the engagement of a performance car for command seating and the approbation of your peers? Maybe you don't have to choose at least not if you can swing a Mercedes-AMG GLC43 coupe. Like the Jaguar F-Pace, Porsche Macan, Audi SQ5, and Mercedes' own GLC43 SUV, the GLC43 coupe is a member of the emerging class of premium compact performance crossovers, vehicles that challenge the idea that SUVs aren't for red-blooded aficionados. The GLC43 coupe earns its place in this contrarian class by delivering a win-win-win proposition: It provides entry into the SUV club; its fastback "four-door coupe" body style is fashion-forward (despite the goofy moniker that Mercedes, BMW, and Audi insist on applying to their various squashed-roofed four-doors); and most important, it drives with the satisfying verve of a sports sedan. That last statement might seem a touch hyperbolic, but it comes backed by hard data. We've now tested both this GLC43 coupe and its fraternal twin, the C43 sedan, so it's easy to gauge how they compare. Family Resemblance Consider that both are built on the C-class platform and are breathed on by AMG, Mercedes-Benz's in-house performance group. Both vehicles share an AMG-tuned 362-hp twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6, an AMG-calibrated nine-speed automatic, and an all-wheel-drive system that sends 69 percent of the engine's torque rearward. Both employ similar multilink front and rear suspensions with adjustable dampers. For our tests, both wore their optional Continental ContiSportContact summer performance rubber on upsize wheels. Since the GLC43 coupe is 6.1 inches taller and 361 pounds heavier than the C43 sedan, logic would say it's no contest. But the numbers say otherwise. The C43 circles the skidpad at 0.92 g, and the GLC43 matches it exactly. The C43 flashes to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The GLC43 gets there in 4.3. The C43 stops from 70 mph in 171 feet, the GLC43 in just 155 although other C43 models we've tested were much closer to this SU-coupe's stopping distance. The sedan does pull ahead as speed rises into the triple digits, but by any measure, the GLC43 coupe is seriously quick. That the GLC43 coupe virtually matches the performance of its sedan analogue is impressive enough, but if that's all it did, we wouldn't be advocating for it. As we've said too many times to count, how a car feels while delivering its performance trumps all and the GLC43 feels great, however and wherever it's driven. It takes only a couple of miles to forget you're behind the wheel of a car that's standing on tiptoes. For all that your eyes, ears, hands, and feet know, you're piloting a sports sedan. Moves Like Jagger The GLC43's lusty twin-turbo V-6 is fat with low-end torque and pulls hard anywhere in the rev range, all the way to its 6500-rpm redline. Although there is some turbo lag, the 3.0-liter's exhaust note is the sound of 10,000 angry wasps fighting their way out of the quad tailpipes. The powerplant dances well with the nine-speed automatic, which slithers through its ratios smoothly and crisply, although in Comfort mode it tended to upshift earlier than we would have liked in traffic. Gearchanges commanded by the steering-wheel paddles are sharp, and in the Sport and Sport+ driving modes, both up- and-downshifts are accompanied by delicious crackles and pops from the exhaust. The muscular powertrain is complemented by a trustworthy and athletic chassis. Like the best sports sedans, the GLC43 proved a happy day-to-day driver, sporty enough to be constantly engaging, refined enough to never tire us out, and agile and tenacious when called upon. Its steering is intuitive and progressive, with just the right amount of heft, and a twist of the thick, three-spoke sport wheel points it eagerly toward apexes. The ride motions in Comfort mode our preferred calibration are clipped but never harsh, firmly controlling body motion just the way you'd expect in a sports sedan. Switching to Sport+ stiffens the ride enough to shake up a can of Sherwin-Williams, so that setting is best saved for short bursts on twisty roads or for entrance-ramp flings. Indeed, attacking our favorite on-ramp revealed the biggest difference between the GLC and its sedan brother: The SUV's taller stature and higher seating position make it feel tippy in fast transitions. Not to worry; clicking it into Sport+ mode drops the ride height a little on the air springs, eliminates the slight turn-in bobble, and restores your confidence that it won't roll over as you exploit the fat Continentals 255/40ZR-21 front, 285/35ZR-21 rear to their howling, chattering, understeering limit. Well-Mannered Warrior In the kind of driving most of us do most of the time, the GLC43 coupe is a refined, comfortable cruiser with firm, supportive seats, rich interior materials, and a surprising amount of room. Despite its fastback roofline, it loses only one cubic foot of cargo space aft of the second row to its conventional, squared-off GLC43 SUV brother. The coupe's rear seat handily accommodates full-size adults, and, like any crossover, it offers the functionality of a fold-down second row and a hatchback. This is a premium SUV, and its $60,645 base price is roughly in line with the competition. Of course, that number easily can be spiked with a long list of options. Our test car was stocked with almost $14,000 in extras, but matching its performance requires you check only the box for summer tires ($1000). Add the infotainment package that contains navigation, and a GLC43 coupe can be had for something closer to $63,000. No small sum that, but it buys a viscerally satisfying, exceptionally refined driving machine. If you're tinkering with the idea of driving something taller, add the GLC43 coupe to the short list of vehicles that will gain you membership in SUV Nation without forcing you to give up the pleasures of driving.

BBUawlm	travel	ustravel	60 Charming American Towns Worth Taking a Road Trip to Visit	Hit the roads less traveled.	Hit the roads less traveled. When you plan a vacation , most people tend to go to more popular places, right? It's usually cities they've read about or towns and attractions that have been recommended by friends and family.

Stuart, Florida Stuart is formally known as the Sailfish Capital of the World , thanks to its close proximity to the St. Lucie River and the Indian River Lagoon. The small town's tropical climate is perfect for snowbirds who enjoy getting away during the bitter winter months, but are looking for a less popular destination. Charlevoix, Michigan From a legendary castle to mushroom houses to a stunning red lighthouse, the small town of Charlevoix has plenty to offer. And if you're a fan of all things lavender, this is the ideal destination for you Charlevoix is home to one of the largest Lavender Hill Farms , abundant with 25 varieties. Black Mountain, North Carolina Black Mountain is nestled deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains with a population of 7,500 and is considered one of the prettiest small towns in the United States, according to Trip Advisor .

There are eight (yes, eight) national parks and heritage sites to visit in the area. St. Simons Island, Georgia History buffs and beach lovers alike will love this small island town off the Georgia coast. There, you can golf, fish, and visit plenty of historical monuments, and you can't miss climbing to the top of the St. Simons lighthouse to see the view of the entire island.

With fishing, boating, snorkeling, multiple golf courses, and more, there's a little something for everyone.

It's home to several distilleries, including Jim Beam and Maker's Mark. Frenchtown, New Jersey Spend a few minutes in this charming, serene town , and you'll forget you're even in New Jersey. It's a great spot for biking and hiking, and if you visit in July, be sure to check out their Bastille Day festival. Trinidad, California With a population of less than 400 people, calling this town small is an understatement. That said, Trinidad is home to some beautiful public beaches and picturesque offshore rocks, and it has a rich Native American historic heritage. Put-In-Bay, Ohio You'll need to take a ferry to make it to this quaint little island , but once you get there, you'll be instantly charmed. Relax at the beach, go sailing, or head to one of its many attractions, like the Antique Car Museum or Butterfly House. Astoria, Oregon Astoria is actually the oldest settlement west of the Rocky Mountains, so if you love history, you'll love exploring this interesting town and its many museums, like the Columbia River Maritime Museum.

Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge, which is home to big cats, is also in Eureka Springs.

The shores are lined with oyster shells that historians say are from Native American gatherings 2,500 years ago. Cool, no? Galena, Illinois The historic charm of this mining town's six-block Main Street will make you feel like you took a time machine to a different decade. After you conquer downtown, must-see attractions include the Old Market House and the Historical Society and Museum. Pella, Iowa Even though this midwest town is quaint and quiet during the majority of the year, it totally transforms in May for the annual Tulip Time Festival. To honor their dutch culture, they transform the streets into the Netherlands and host an epic parade. Welch, West Virginia This town used to be all about coal mining, but today it's rich in history thanks to the Kimball War Memorial. We recommend grabbing a bite and sitting next to the Elkhorn Creek that flows through the town and into the Tug Fort. Wolfeboro, New Hampshire This town's motto is "The Oldest Summer Resort in America," and its prime location on Lake Winnipesaukee proves why. People from all over New Hampshire, Boston and even Hollywood (Drew Barrymore once visited!) vacation here during warm summer months. Corning, New York Wineries and breweries: check. Panoramic views of a gorgeous lake: check. Restaurants filled with top-notch food: check. This southern Finger Lakes community offers something for everyone and has become a favorite for destination weddings. Keene, New Hampshire Even though downtown Keene is a must-visit destination, the countryside and lakes are the real treasures in this town. Make sure you take a tour of the covered bridges and hike up Mount Monadnock during your stay. Ferndale, California It makes sense why this city's population of 1,372 people all live within one square mile when you see how lovely it is downtown. It's known as the "Cream City" for its well-preserved Victorian storefronts and homes and will let you escape the daily grind. Franklin, Tennessee About 21 miles south of Nashville is a much quieter downtown experience that still offers tons of culture.

If you've had your fill of pinot, there's still plenty to do, including hiking, biking and even canoeing. Lanesboro, Minnesota Known as the bed and breakfast capital of Minnesota, this small town (the population is just 754!) offers relaxation for couples and outdoor adventures for families in the bluffs of the Root River Valley. Little Compton, Rhode Island This fishing town originally belonged to the Sakonnet tribe, but today it's known as Rhode Island's secret coast. It's a favorite place for locals to escape to the beach, take in local artwork or grab a lobster roll. Woods Hole, Massachusetts On Cape Cod is this tiny, bustling town that was once a pass-through destination for Martha's Vineyard ferry travelers. Now it holds its own thanks to a waterfront filled with restaurants and shopping. Marietta, Ohio Back in the 1700s, when this town was settled, it was named in honor of Marie Antoinette. Today, it's a historic riverboat town that's ideal for families who seek out vacations full of outdoor adventures. Cedar Key, Florida This secluded beach community is less about the hustle and bustle and more about small town living. Proof: The restaurant- and buffet-filled streets of the mile-long historic district are filled with bicycles instead of cars. Grand Haven, Michigan Located on the Eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the mouth of the Grand River is this appropriately named town , which offers wine tasting, sand dune riding and an annual Coast Guard Festival at the end of every summer. Frederick, Maryland Less than one hour from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore is this small town that's surrounded by mountains, wineries and orchards. Downtown has even been designated as the Arts & Entertainment District, where you can find live music, dancing, you name it. Shelburne, Vermont Along the shores of Lake Champlain is this quiet town that's most famous for Shelburne Farms, a series of barns where people can milk cows and watch cheesemakers make cheddars. Damascus, Virginia Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia is this small town (we're talking a population of 814 people) that is known as "Trail Town." Hikers and bikers seek it out since it's at the cross roads of some of the most beautiful trails in the state. Fredericksburg, Texas This small town has surprising German roots and old-time residents even refer to it as Fritztown. But the Magic Mile (a shopping scene with more than 150 stores) and some of the best wine tasting in Texas are what keeps the tourists coming back. Gallup, New Mexico There's a reason this town is known as the Indian jewelry capital of the world: It's rich in Native American culture and the destination embraces it across the board. Another pro tip? The High Desert Trail System is an amazing way to take in the sights by foot. Paia, Hawaii This little town is known for offering one of the few remaining traditional island experiences   in fact, it kind of feels like a time warp. The one-stoplight town is vibrant, colorful and offers authentic cuisine. Hood River, Oregon During any time of year, this town along the Columbia River offers outdoor activities for adventure seekers, including skiing, wind surfing and mountain biking. After a day outside, you can explore one of the three microbreweries located downtown. Sitka, Alaska Even though this town is hard to get to (it's only accessible by air or sea!), once you arrive you'll be pleasantly surprised by how unique it is. It's nestled amongst a spruce and hemlock rain forest and sea life. Go on a tour to spot humpback whales. Natchitoches, Louisiana History buffs, you're going to want to visit this town , which is the oldest permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase. Today, you can wander around the 33-block district or try one of their famous meat pies. Berlin, Maryland If you need proof that this quaint town is Hollywood-approved, both Runaway Bride and Tuck Everlasting were filmed here. And it's not surprising why: Strolling the streets and visiting the antique shops instantly make you forget what year it is. (In a good way.) Ste. Genevieve, Missouri Not all American wine is made in California: This French-influenced town (it was founded by French Canadian colonists) is home to several vineyards, along with its historic cornerstone church that goes by the town's name. Davis, Oklahoma There's a reason Turner Falls Park is a favorite swimming hole for locals: It's home to an impressive 77-foot tall waterfall that you can swim underneath. After taking a dip, explore the rock castle that was built into the hillside nearby. Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania Those rolling hills? That charming architecture? There's a reason this town is known as the "Switzerland of Pennsylvania." Come here if you want to try your hand at white water rafting or hike the day away, then roam the quaint town afterward. Capitola, California This bright and vibrant town is a quiet surf destination for some, a trendy place to shop and eat for others and a place where you can fish off of the wharf if you fit somewhere in between. Guilford, Connecticut This quiet town was first settled in 1639 and is considered to have the third largest collection of historic homes in New England. But even if you're not into history, the shops on the green, local seafood and the peaceful marina are more than worth the trip. Lead, South Dakota If Mount Rushmore is on your bucket list, skip the bustling Rapid City and stay at this quieter escape instead. It was once a mining town, but has since lost the gold and kept the charm. Visit the Black Hills Mining Museum to gain a deeper appreciation of the town's history. Shipshewana, Indiana This cute town boasts an Amish community and the largest flea market in the country, featuring a whopping 900 booths that cover 100 acres of land. You can munch on treats like sweet corn, while the kids feed animals at the petting zoo. War Eagle, Arkansas The famous War Eagle Mill was built in 1832 and has been destroyed and rebuilt three times, yet it's still in operation today. During the fall, the town hosts an elaborate craft fair that DIY lovers won't want to miss. Creede, Colorado This historic mining town is like walking into an old western movie. In fact, Johnny Depp shot scenes here for the action western Lone Ranger. The downtown shops and surrounding nature adventures allow you to enjoy a trip that's as busy or quiet as you'd like. Abilene, Kansas This town's claim to fame is that President Dwight D. Eisenhower grew up here, which is why they have a library and museum dedicated to him. Another can't-miss attraction is Great Plains Theatre, which used to be a church. Boone, North Carolina It's appropriate that this town is named after American pioneer Daniel Boone, since most visitors come to hike and explore the local Blue Ridge Mountains. The town is also full of bluegrass musicians and Appalachian storytellers. Milton, Delaware You don't have to choose between different bodies of water here: It's located on the banks of the Broadkill River and is just a few miles from the Delaware Bay. But some people might find it even more exciting that it's home to the famous Dogfish Head Brewing Company. Canton, Mississippi The most popular area of this southern town is the courthouse square, which is full of historic buildings and shopping, including the Canton Flea Market. At night, escape to the east side, which is filled with adorable B&Bs. Serenbe, Georgia The beauty of this urban town is that it's located in the middle of rural country and is full of farm-to-table restaurants, shopping and miles of trails. More than anything, the community of 400 prioritizes living a slower, happier pace of life.
AAtnEW6	finance	ads-aol-divorce	10 Things You Need to Know About Your Money as You Divorce	Your financial costs don't end once you sign divorce papers.	Your financial costs don't end once you sign divorce papers. It's true that breaking up is hard to do, and the difficult changes don't all involve the heart. In addition to severing your emotional bonds with your spouse, divorce changes many aspects of your financial life. Some are obvious, like the fees you'll pay for your divorce attorney. But some involve areas of your finances you may never have considered related to your marriage. We worked with several divorce experts to compile this list of things you need to know about your money as you divorce. Learn more about these divorce secrets you need to know . Cost of the Divorce Process Divorce ushers specific monetary challenges into your life and also changes the way you view a host of financial issues. But let's start with the process itself, which can cost big bucks, especially if one spouse is antagonistic. The cost of a divorce varies around the country, but California is fairly typical. Legal costs average $17,500 in California, which includes over $13,000 in attorney fees. Add to the total post-divorce costs like therapy and financial planning services. Related: The Best and Worst States to Get a Low-Cost Divorce What to do: Keep costs down by working out contested issues through mediation or arbitration. Lawyers' fees are the largest part of the cost of divorce. If you fight over an issue and it goes to trial, you may win the point yet lose the same amount or more in hourly fees. Think compromise instead of victory and you'll pay less in the long run. Problems Accessing Cash "Cash can be the first thing to disappear when a spouse files for divorce," said divorce attorney Chris Hildebrand, general partner with Hildebrand Law in Scottsdale, Ariz. Many times, Hildebrand said, the spouse filing for divorce clears out half of the available cash, leaving the other half in the account. But not always. If one spouse controls the bank accounts, that gives him or her extraordinary leverage in a contentious divorce. The other person may have problems accessing cash. What to do: Act now to open a solo account at a different bank and deposit some money there. The best way to protect yourself from financial extortion is by having access to your own money. As an added bonus, you'll get a jump on financial independence. Cost of Getting Emotional According to consumer expert and nationally syndicated columnist Clark Howard , your approach to divorce can cost you money if you're not careful. One factor in how the divorce financial balance sheet comes out is how much attention each person pays to the bottom line. "Men tend to look at divorce as a financial thing," Howard said, "while women are typically more emotional and tend to pay less attention to the financial agreement. And what ends up happening is that women often end up significantly poorer than men after a divorce." It's not just divorce   your emotions are making you broke . What to do: The end of your marriage, whatever caused it, will likely make you sad. But don't let that deter you from walking through the money details of the split. "So while your heart is hurting," Howard said, "your wallet will end up hurting more in the long run if you don't pay close attention to the financial aspects of the divorce." Mortgages and other Loans If you and your spouse own a house, odds are you have a mortgage. You may also have other loans the two of you took out during the marriage. Don't be lulled by the fact that the judge awards debts to your spouse to pay, or splits them between you. "No matter what the divorce decree says about a loan   he's going to pay for this, she gets that   the lender doesn't consider any of that," Howard said. If both of your names are on the loan and the judge orders your ex to pay it but he doesn't, the lender can come after you, too. "You are still financially liable for that loan," Howard said. "Regardless of the terms of the divorce settlement, the lender wasn't part of that. And since the creditors made the deal with you, they're not letting you off the hook." What to do: To avoid this situation, make sure that if your spouse is assigned debt in the divorce, the loan gets refinanced , removing your name. "That will relieve any legal responsibility for it," Howard said. Lower Household Revenue Post-Divorce "I don't care how rich you are, when you go through divorce you have less," said Emma Johnson, founder of WealthySingleMommy and author of the new book "The Kickass Single Mom: Be Financially Independent, Discover Your Sexiest Self, and Raise Fabulous, Happy Children." It takes less money to maintain one united household than two separate houses. "There are other ways married people save money, whether it is a shared Costco membership, sharing travel and accommodation costs on vacation, or reduced child care," Johnson said. What to do: Take advantage of your newfound freedom to follow a better career path. During the years following her divorce, Johnson said her financial situation improved dramatically. "Forced to return to work full-time, and no longer married to someone who questioned my career decisions, I was able to build a business that grosses about three times our household income when married," she said. Read This: Key Signs You're Ready to Start Your Own Business Unpaid Child Support Each parent has a legal obligation to provide financial support for their children, and often that is enforced by court-ordered child support payments. If you are the custodial parent, these payments help cover your monthly expenses and those of your children. But relying on your ex for support may not feel safe. What if the payments stop coming? What to do: Be sure you get a withholding order for support payments from the court at the time of the divorce. That way, your ex's employer withholds from each of his paychecks the amount required to pay family support. The money is then forwarded directly to you. Collecting child support is more difficult if your ex frequently changes jobs or is self-employed, Hildebrand said. If you don't get the payments, file a motion to have the non-paying parent held in contempt of court. The judge can toss your ex in jail and provide for work release during the day until the child support payments are current. Taxes Post-Divorce Your tax status and deductions change after a divorce, and single-income families can encounter big tax problems . If the calendar year ends and your divorce is still pending, you'll have to file as "married filing separately" or "married filing jointly" for that year. Once the divorce goes through, you cannot claim head of household status unless your kids live with you at least half the year. Only one parent can claim children as dependents. A noncustodial parent can only claim the kids if the other parent signs IRS Form 8332, Release of Claim to Exemption for Child of Divorced or Separated Parents. What to do: If you and your ex-spouse agree, you can claim the kids as dependents during alternate years. More Tax Guidelines: Here's Who Claims the Children on Taxes After Divorce Retirement Needs Retirement looks different if you move from being a stay-at-home parent with a high-earning spouse to a divorcee. Many who divorce end up in that large group of people who are below or just barely above the poverty line when they retire. You need to keep retirement benefits in mind as you draft a divorce settlement. Remember, divorce will affect your social security benefits , too. What to do: While you are splitting assets in the divorce, consider the future value of each asset rather than just focusing on its present value. The increase in value of retirement accounts isn't taxed, and these accounts will be worth more in the long run. Emergency Fund Before a divorce, you may have heard that you should put away three to six months living expenses to provide a financial safety net in case income stops. But it probably didn't seem critical given the two wage earners in the family. If one of you lost your job, the other could carry the family in the short term. After a divorce, that emergency fund becomes critical. If your salary stops coming in, there's no second salary to count on. This is also important because you may not have access to the credit you need following a divorce. What to do: In post-divorce financial planning, prioritize the emergency fund. That cash fund will protect you in case the unexpected strikes. Set a target amount and then, starting from the moment you file divorce papers, deposit all spare funds into the account until you meet your goal. Learn More: 35 Ways to Save for Your Emergency Fund Insurance Post-Divorce Insurance needs increase once divorce papers are filed. Hildebrand said some states, such as Arizona, have laws preventing one spouse from removing the other from a health insurance plan during the divorce. Once the divorce is final, however, that spouse must obtain his or her own health insurance coverage. But health insurance isn't the only insurance you need after a household moves from two wage-earners to one. You also should consider insuring your ability to generate income. What to do: Purchase long-term disability insurance. When your income is the only income, you need to protect it in case you get sick or injured and cannot work for an extended period.

Back in 2015, Jean-Marc Gales, CEO of Lotus, even told us he had plans for one. But despite all the talk, a high-riding Lotus never appeared. From the sound of things, though, the long-rumored SUV is back on track. Speaking to Autocar, Gales	The rumor that Lotus will build an SUV has been around for years. Back in 2015, Jean-MarcGales, CEO of Lotus , even told us he had plans for one . But despite all the talk, a high-riding Lotus never appeared. From the sound of things, though, the long-rumored SUV is back on track. Speaking to Autocar, Gales said that under new owner Geely , Lotus has plans for several new models, one of which will be an SUV."We will always have sportscars, but we're looking at other segments," said Gales. "The SUV market changes as well. It's not just cars that are six feet high and wide now. It's a huge market that's becomingmore segmented. There is a niche within that for a Lotus crossover that is light and aerodynamic and handles like nothing else." While Lotus plans to continue building sports cars in the U.K., the expanded lineup mightend up being built elsewhere."We stay in the U.K. for sports cars, what we do for other cars needs defining," he said. But Gales sounds optimistic that any changes will be good for the company overall. "We are still looking at the next generation," said Gales. "There is an open book, which is good. We have a world-class automotive manufacturer behind us. I see it as a new chapter. One has closed and we can start afresh. It's good news for us, good news for the region. There's loads to do and I'm here to stay." Gales also doesn't sound worried that having Chinese owners will force Lotus to change what it is. "We're Lotus and we're about handling, lightweight and aero, where nothing can beat us," he said. "Lotus is like nothing else in the world. Our cars don't have the most power, but it's the feeling, the way it drives and handles." Whenasked if Lotus wouldsourcepartsfrom its new owners, Gales wasn't opposed to the idea. "We'll be part of a big family, so why wouldn't we?" he said. "There are bound to be synergies; we need to keep the identity of the brand. Using parts of other brands, the option is there, but we need to keep our identity. Lotus's identity is light weight, aerodynamics, and handling." As much as we love cars like the Elise and the Evora, if Gales can build an SUV that sticks to the principles that make Lotus special, it will probably be one heck of an SUV.

Then, when you dump out the water at the base of the tree, the water quickly runs off. Here's a solution: Get some old 5-gallon buckets and drill a 1/4-in. hole near the bottom of each one. After plugging the holes with dowels, fill the buckets and haul them to the trees in a wheelbarrow. Set the buckets near the base of the trees and unplug the holes.

Roll the stone forward onto the third pipe until the rear pipe comes free . Then move the rear pipe to the front and repeat. This technique works best on relatively flat ground. On mild slopes, you'll need a helper to shift pipes while you stabilize the load. Don't use this method on steeper slopes.

BBUg5Or	lifestyle	lifestylebuzz	This $29 Anti-Aging Mask Made Kim and Kourtney Kardashian Unrecognizable	This $29 Anti-Aging Mask Made Kim and Kourtney Kardashian Unrecognizable	As the skincare craze grows bigger and bigger, so does the use of face masks. Sheet masks can be so hydrating and calming, and clay masks do a great job of sucking out excess oil and smoothing things out. There are even light therapy masks and carbonated masks! But we've tried all of those already, and we can't help ourselves   we want something new. Shop With Us: Hurry! Victoria Beckham Must-Haves Are Seriously on Sale and Selling Out Fast We've never used anything like the Hanacure All-in-One Facial Starter Kit before, but we had to learn more after Kourtney Kardashian posted a photo of herself and sister Kim Kardashian wearing it on Instagram this past year. At least, we think it was them. The mask, while applied, changed their appearance so drastically that they were practically unrecognizable! In her caption , Kourtney said Kim had convinced her to try it out, and joked that she felt "stunning" with it on. See it: Get the Hanacure All-in-One Facial Starter Kit for $29 at Violet Grey! Also available at Amazon ! Other shoppers are also loving the results they've seen from using this mask. One said their skin was "brighter, tighter, smoother [and] clearer," also mentioning that it almost completely faded their smile lines and dark spots. Another said that after just one use, the lines over their upper lip, which formed due to smoking, had decreased. One shopper called themselves a "believer" after experiencing the Hanacure magic for themselves! This unique Korean-beauty mask was inspired by the lotus flower, which blossoms anew with every sunrise. Just as the lotus is beautifully reborn, this mask claims to do the same thing to our skin. It's an all-in-one, multi-action treatment that claims to smooth, correct, brighten, tighten, lift, firm and detoxify, resulting in a "visibly younger appearance." This kit is equipped with patented CO2 OctoLift, an age-defying technology that was created to prevent and diminish common skin concerns while removing impurities. It's dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic, vegan and gluten-free, and was formulated with no sulfates, parabens or phthalates. Inside this starter kit are a Lifting Serum ampoule, a Gelling Solution and an application brush. To get started, mix everything together thoroughly to form a jelly-like consistency. This is a single-use kit, so make sure to use it all at once! Then we can use the brush to apply the mixture onto our face, neck and hands. Avoid getting too close to the eye area, because things are about to get real. After 5 to 10 minutes with the mask on, we may start to feel a "dramatic tightening and lifting effect" and be transformed a la Kourtney and Kim. To intensify this effect, place face in front of a fan. We can also use a blowdryer! Just make sure to have it on the "cool" setting. After 20 to 30 minutes, the mask should be completely dry to the touch. We can then rinse it off with warm water. Once we're all rinsed off and have patted dry, we may find a brighter and healthier complexion in the mirror! See it: Get the Hanacure All-in-One Facial Starter Kit for $29 at Violet Grey! Also available at Amazon ! Another thing we may be greeted with is a flushed redness, but that's not a bad thing! The mask claims to increase the flow of our blood circulation, resulting in redness, especially on paler skin tones. This redness should only last up to 90 minutes, so it's nothing to worry about! Of course we love the resulting benefits offered by the mask, but it's also just super fun to imagine how it'll transform our face while we have it on. This is a great opportunity to create an alter ego, like Sasha Fierce, but more like Silly Face. Violet Grey experts recommend replenishing an order of four masks every month when subscribing, giving us about one mask per week. Violet Grey always has our best interests at heart, approving every item they sell the Violet Code. That means this mask was discovered and tested by their community of artists, experts and influencers, as well as approved to meet their discerning standards. If it's good enough for the Kardashians, it's certainly good enough for Us ! So, who's trying this kit out? Just make sure to take a selfie before rinsing! Maybe we can try to convince our friends we had a long lost sibling this whole time who looks . . . kind of like us, but in an uncanny valley type of way. Okay, we're having too much fun with this. Time to get masking! See it: Get the Hanacure All-in-One Facial Starter Kit for $29 at Violet Grey! Also available at Amazon ! Looking for something else?

AA2qznx	autos	autosreview	2015 BMW 428i Gran Coupe First Drive	There's lots of lipstick on this liftgate, based as it is on the more sensual BMW 4 Series coupe. Read the 2015 BMW 428i Gran Coupe First Drive review here.	We Yanks have demonstrated very little love for hatchback cars, despite their willingness to swallow large loads in an aero-slick body. We've drubbed most examples of the breed out of our national neighborhood as if they were sex offenders. Ah, but sometimes we make exceptions for particularly pretty ones -- Aston Martin Rapide? Audi A7? Yes please! Might this latest riff on the BMW 3/4 Series architecture enjoy the same warm reception, or is ritual shunning more likely? There's lots of lipstick on this liftgate, based as it is on the lower, wider, infinitely more sensual 4 Series coupe. Indeed, it shares all its key dimensions with the "real" two-door coupe except height (up 0.5 inch), which means it measures 0.4 inch longer, 1.8 inches lower, and 0.6 inch wider than the solid-citizen 3 Series sedan. There's sexy frameless glass on the four doors, and the wider, lower, slightly squintier front and rear graphics. Get someone looking at those voluptuous rear hips, and they'll be amply distracted from the scant visual evidence that this fastback opens from the top. Functionally, reinforcing the rear of this new F36 bodywork to compensate for the lack of a bulkhead and to support the hatch hinge structure and adding two doors increases weight by about 140 pounds. The body structure remains less rigid than the coupe's, which the suspension tuning takes into account. No manual transmission option is offered, but the rest of the engine and driveline choices are available (428i, 435i, and 428i xDrive). Space-wise, the Gran Coupe's interior measures slightly larger because the rear doors carve out 2.6 additional inches of shoulder room, but the hatch hinge header structure erases 1.1 inch of rear headroom, so it feels tighter in back. And of course the cargo area is way more versatile. Fold the seats down and there's 45.9 cubic feet of room enough to accommodate two bicycles without removing the front wheels. And the 40/20/40 split-folding rear seatback easily accommodates rear passengers and four sets of skis. So how does it drive? Just as well as the other 4 Series variants. Any loss in total body rigidity did not make itself apparent while jinking through the many curves tracing the Rio Ebro in northeast Spain. Naturally BMW took the precaution of equipping every press vehicle at the launch as a 428i with the $3500 M Sport package (aero-tuned front and rear fascias, 19-inch wheels shod in Bridgestone Potenza S001 tires, sport suspension, sport seats, and other trim), dynamic handling package (Adaptive M Suspension, sport steering, $1000), and four-piston front/two-piston rear fixed-caliper M Sport brakes ($650). So equipped, the latest Gran Coupe inspires the exact same level of confidence that has made this chassis such a formidable competitor in our comparison tests. And don't feel compelled to spring for the six; the four makes terrific noises and acquits itself admirably in the dash from corner to corner. Just make sure you secure whatever you're carrying in all that newfound luggage space. We're inclined to recommend the 4 Gran Coupe over its myriad platform siblings if for no other reason than the success of this (for now) peerless offering may lure Audi's similarly fetching A5 Sportback hatch to our shores. So to summarize your BMW entry-level luxury decision tree, decide first on your preferred cargo access method: hinged above or below the rear window? If below, then 3 Series sedan, 4 series coupe/convertible. Top hinged options include the X3 sports activity vehicle, the X4 sports activity "coupe," the 3 Series Gran Tourismo (based on China's longer wheelbase, this one is slightly longer and lower but similar in shape to the X4), the 3 Series Touring wagon, and now the 4 Series Gran Coupe. Color us skeptical of BMW product specialists' assurances that these vehicles all behave so differently that buyers won't be conflicted or confused. We suggest you save time in the dealership by first employing a dart board at home. 2015 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe BASE PRICE $41,225-$46,725* VEHICLE LAYOUT Front-engine, RWD/AWD, 5-pass, 4-door hatchback ENGINES 2.0L/240-hp/255-lb-ft turbocharged DOHC 16-valve I-4; 3.0L/300-hp/300-lb-ft turbocharged DOHC 24-valve I-6 TRANSMISSION 8-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT 3600-3750 lb (mfr) WHEELBASE 110.6 in LENGTH X WIDTH X HEIGHT 182.6 x 71.9 x 54.7 in 0-60 MPH 4.9-5.7 sec (mfr est) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON 22-23 / 32-33 mpg ENERGY CONSUMPTION, CITY/HWY 147-153 / 102-105 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS 0.73-0.76 lb/mile ON SALE IN U.S. June 2014 (xDrive September 2014) *$38,455-$43,570 with tourist delivery in Munich
BBUg9Do	autos	autosreview	2019 Chevrolet Impala: What You Need to Know	The 2019 Chevrolet Impala offers a soft and balanced ride, a good predicted reliability rating, and an abundance of passenger and cargo space. However, it only ranks midpack in the large car class because of its run-of-the-mill cabin materials and underwhelming base engine.	The 2019 Chevrolet Impala offers a soft and balanced ride, a good predicted reliability rating, and an abundance of passenger and cargo space. However, it only ranks midpack in the large car class because of its run-of-the-mill cabin materials and underwhelming base engine. Is the Chevrolet Impala a Good Car? The 2019 Chevy Impala is a pretty good large car . It has a well-balanced ride, good maneuverability, and seats that offer all-day comfort. However, its base four-cylinder engine delivers insufficient power to easily move the sedan. This Chevy is one of the roomiest cars in the segment, with abundant passenger room and a large trunk. The infotainment features are easy to operate, but the cabin features some second-rate materials. Should I Buy the Chevrolet Impala? Within the class, the 2019 Impala is a good value. Its roughly $28,000 base price is one of the lowest among large cars , and you get lots of standard features. That said, you may want to skip its weak base engine and pay another $1,095 to get the upgraded V6. Though the Impala is a good car for the price, you should check out some competitors. The Toyota Avalon costs about $7,650 more than the Impala, but it's fully redesigned for 2019, comes with a ton of standard technology, and is more upscale. The Buick LaCrosse is more fun to drive, and like the Impala, it has a roomy cabin. Should I Buy a New or Used Chevrolet Impala? The 2019 Impala is part of a generation that started with the 2014 model. For 2015, a Wi-Fi hot spot became standard, and stop-start technology became standard with the base engine. The 2016 Impala gained available Apple CarPlay and wireless device charging, and 2017 Impala saw only minor changes to trim names. For 2018, Chevy made a rearview camera standard, along with the MyLink touch-screen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. There were no major changes for 2019, so choosing a 2018 model could save thousands of dollars on essentially the same car. We Did the Research for You: 33 Reviews Analyzed We analyzed 33 Chevrolet Impala reviews   along with safety scores, fuel economy estimates, and more   to help you decide if the 2019 Impala is the right new car for you. This 2019 Chevy Impala review incorporates applicable research for all model years in this generation, which spans the 2014 through 2019 model years. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News & World Report has been ranking cars, trucks, and SUVs since 2007, and our team has more than 75 years of combined automotive industry experience. To remain objective, we don't accept expensive gifts or trips from car companies, and an outside team manages the advertising on our site. How Much Does the Chevrolet Impala Cost? The 2019 Chevrolet Impala starts at $28,020, which is one of the lowest base prices in the class. By comparison, the Buick LaCrosse starts at $29,570, while the Toyota Avalon has a much higher starting price of $35,650. The Impala has three trim levels: LS, LT, and Premier. The LS and LT trims come standard with a four-cylinder engine, and a V6 is optional in both models for $1,095. The midrange Impala LT starts at $30,520 and has several packages available, ranging from about $500 to around $1,300. The top-of-the-line Chevy Impala Premier starts at $36,720. Adding packages and options can push the price above $40,000. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Chevrolet dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Chevrolet deals page . Chevrolet Impala Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Chevrolet Impala or Toyota Avalon? The fully redesigned Toyota Avalon ranks a couple of spots above the Impala in the large car class . It comes standard with a V6 engine that matches the Impala's available V6's power, but the Avalon gets better gas mileage. Both cars have similarly cushioned rides. Inside, the differences are more apparent. The Avalon's cabin features first-rate materials throughout. It comes with a number of standard features the Impala doesn't, including synthetic leather upholstery, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control. It also comes with three more USB ports than the Chevy, as well as many driver assistance features, including adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking. You can get an Avalon with a head-up display, a surround-view parking camera system, and reverse automatic braking   none which are available in the Impala. The Avalon is a great car, but its steep starting price of $35,650 is topped in the class only by the Avalon Hybrid . If you're looking to spend less, the Impala is still a good choice. Which Is Better: Chevrolet Impala or Buick LaCrosse? The 2019 Buick LaCrosse is one of the top performers in the class. Its standard mild-hybrid powertrain produces not only admirable fuel economy but also quick acceleration from a stop. For those who want more power, a muscular V6 engine is available. The LaCrosse feels more poised through turns than other large sedans, but it doesn't sacrifice passenger comfort or ride quality. Both cars have similar standard features lists and plenty of back-seat room. The Impala gets you a larger trunk, but the LaCrosse has a nicer cabin. At any trim level, the LaCrosse is priced higher than the Impala. So while the Buick is a class leader, the Impala's excellent value makes it a more viable option for many shoppers. Impala Interior How Many People Does the Impala Seat? The Chevrolet Impala seats five people with adult-friendly space in both rows. This full-size sedan has one of the largest back seats in the segment, giving taller passengers enough room to stretch out and relax. Up front, the driver enjoys a commanding view of the road ahead, though visibility to the sides and around turns is compromised by thick roof pillars. The front seats deliver adequate comfort for long drives, but side support is lacking. Cloth upholstery and a power-adjustable driver's seat are standard. You can upgrade to comfort amenities like genuine leather seats, heated and/or ventilated front seats, and a power-adjustable passenger seat. Impala and Car Seats The Impala has a complete set of LATCH car-seat connectors for both outboard rear seats. The middle seat has a top tether anchor and a lower anchor on the passenger side, which you can use in conjunction with the lower anchor from the driver's side seat. Note that if you put a car seat in the middle position, you won't be able to put one on the driver's side. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave this LATCH system a rating of Acceptable for its ease of use. IIHS notes that all the lower anchors are buried deep in the seat and hard to reach. There's little room to move your hands around the anchors when going for the middle-seat attachments. On the bright side, it doesn't take much effort to attach the car-seat straps to the anchors. Impala Interior Quality Overall, the Impala has a nice interior quality. The cabin design is sleek and modern, with simple lines and an intuitive dash layout. However, there are some cheap-feeling plastic trim pieces that detract from an otherwise upscale atmosphere. Impala Cargo Space The Impala's 18.8 cubic feet of trunk space dwarves nearly every class rival. The 2018 Buick LaCrosse has 15 cubic feet, and the 2019 Toyota Avalon has around 16. You should have no problem loading several large suitcases or lots of bags from a shopping spree. The Impala's second row folds down nearly flat in a 60/40 configuration to let you haul long items. The trunk's large and wide opening further increases the car's utility. Impala Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The Impala's relatively low price tag doesn't prevent it from having an array of impressive standard features. Highlights include proximity key entry, push-button start, and the laudable MyLink infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen, three USB ports, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and satellite radio. This interface is easy to use and quickly registers your touch to process commands. You can also take advantage of the standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay systems to connect your smartphone to MyLink. One hiccup is that the touch screen can be a little hard for the driver to reach. Chevy includes lots of physical buttons and knobs below the touch screen so you can easily adjust the volume and climate or scroll through radio stations. These buttons are clearly laid out and marked. Moving up the trim ladder and adding packages gets you additional options like remote start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a dual-pane sunroof, a 120-volt power outlet, navigation, and an 11-speaker Bose surround-sound system. Impala Performance Impala Engine: 4 Is Too Few The 2019 Chevrolet Impala comes standard with a four-cylinder EcoTec engine that puts out 197 horsepower and 191 pound-feet of torque. This engine struggles to move the large four-door around. A better match for this car's size and heft is the optional V6 engine, which makes 305 horsepower and 264 pound-feet of torque. This powertrain delivers ample muscle to get the Impala up to highway speeds and give you the extra oomph to pass other cars. You'll also appreciate the extra power when taking off from a stop, especially if you have a car full of people or cargo. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, which receives mixed reviews. While some critics say that shifts are smooth and quick, others think it's not as refined as it should be. Impala Gas Mileage: OK With its standard engine, the 2019 Impala gets an EPA-estimated 22 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. Those numbers are about average for the class. The V6 is only slightly less efficient, earning 19 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. The V6 would cost you about $250 more per year in fuel than the four-cylinder. The 2019 Toyota Avalon comes standard with a V6 that gets better mileage than the Impala's I-4, earning 22 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway. The 2018 Buick LaCrosse 's V6 is also more efficient than the Impala's comparable engine, earning an estimated 25/35 mpg. Impala Ride and Handling: Well Balanced The Chevy Impala delivers a great balance of driving dynamics. It shares lots of steering components with the sporty Chevy Camaro , making parking and maneuvering through tight spaces easy, despite the car's big size. The steering also has enough weight to keep you planted on the road as you take turns with confidence. Still, don't mistake the Impala for a sports sedan. For the most part, the Impala boasts a comfortable and quiet ride. It absorbs most bumps in the road, and the cabin shuts out most road and wind noise. The optional 20-inch wheels, however, make the ride quality stiffer and increase road noise. Impala Reliability Is the Chevrolet Impala Reliable? J.D. Power gives the 2019 Impala an above-average predicted reliability rating of four out of five. Chevrolet Impala Warranty Chevrolet backs the Impala with a three-year/36,000-mile limited warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. Impala Safety Impala Crash Test Results The 2019 Chevrolet Impala has a five-star overall crash test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The car earned five out of five stars in the frontal and side crash tests and four stars in the rollover test. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave it the highest rating of Good in four crash tests and the second-highest rating of Acceptable in the driver-side small overlap front test. However, the IIHS gave the Impala's headlights the lowest rating of Poor for outward visibility. Impala Safety Features Though many rivals are starting to include more active safety features as standard equipment, the 2019 Impala only comes standard with a rearview camera. Optional advanced safety tech includes rear parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and lane departure warning. Most of these optional features are only available in packages offered with the two higher trims. Impala Dimensions and Weight The Impala measures 16.75 feet from bumper to bumper. Its curb weight is between 3,681 and 3,811 pounds. Where is the 2019 Chevrolet Impala Built? Chevy builds the Impala in Michigan and Canada. Which Chevrolet Impala Model Is Right for Me? The 2019 Chevrolet Impala is available in three trims: LS, LT, and Premier. The LS and LT come standard with a four-cylinder engine; a V6 is optional. The Premier trim is only available with the V6. All Impala models feature front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic transmission. Though the base model comes equipped with lots of cool features, it may be worth upgrading to the midrange Impala LT, which is available with several optional packages. We suggest going with the LT Leather package, which also requires purchasing the Convenience package. Together, those bundles add genuine leather upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated front seats, and a heated steering wheel. If you go with either the LS or the LT, you should also spring for the V6 engine over the weaker-performing four-cylinder. Chevrolet Impala LS The 2019 Chevrolet Impala LS starts at $28,020. Standard features include a rearview camera, an 8-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, three USB ports, a six-speaker stereo, satellite radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, a Wi-Fi hot spot, cloth and vinyl upholstery, an eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat, proximity keyless entry, and push-button start. Upgrading to the V6 engine costs $1,095. Remote start is optional for $325. Chevrolet Impala LT The 2019 Impala LT retails for $30,520. Additional standard features in the LT include dual-zone automatic climate control, remote start, and a genuine leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel. As with the LS, the V6 engine is a $1,095 option. For $1,275, the Sunroof and Spoiler package adds a dual-pane sunroof and a rear spoiler. The LT Leather package costs $1,195 and includes genuine leather upholstery and an eight-way power-adjustable passenger seat. To get heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and a 120-volt household-style power outlet, add the $875 LT Convenience package. The LT Entertainment package retails for $835 and comes with navigation, an 11-speaker Bose surround-sound system, and a 120-volt household-style power outlet. Lastly, the $495 Driver Convenience package gets you features like rear parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. Some packages may require upgrading to the V6 engine and/or adding additional packages. Chevrolet Impala Premier The Chevy Impala Premier starts at $36,720. The Premier trim adds leather upholstery, heated front seats, an eight-way power-adjustable passenger seat, a Bose surround-sound stereo, a 120-volt household-style power outlet, navigation, rear parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. For $1,275, the Premier Confidence package adds adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and lane departure warning. The $935 Premier Convenience package includes ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel. A dual-pane sunroof is optional for $1,050.

The Final Call The 2019 Chevrolet Impala is a roomy car, offering a large trunk and good seating space to stretch out. Despite some subpar cabin materials, the Impala's interior impresses with a generous number of standard features, including a user-friendly infotainment system. It has a good predicted reliability rating to boot. However, its base engine is underpowered. The Impala is worth considering, but a few rivals are more appealing overall. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis.

BBFpq8n	autos	autosnews	2018 Lincoln MKC First Look: Tweaked But Not Totally New	A nip here, a tuck there, and a new nose for the compact crossover	The Lincoln MKC might be based on the Ford Escape , but when we first drove the MKC back in 2014, we were impressed with how well it differentiated itself from its nonluxury sibling. It wasn't competitive enough to win our most recent comparison test, but with a comfortable ride and generally attractive styling, it moves the brand in the right direction. But now that the MKC has been out for a few years, Lincoln 's given its compact crossover a midcycle refresh. The biggest changes you'll see are to the MKC's exterior. The current model isn't exactly lacking in the styling department, but it doesn't have the new corporate grille that made its debut on the Continental. The new MKC changes that, tweaking the rest of the front end's styling to integrate the new nose. The restyled front end isn't revolutionary, but it works well, especially when you consider that the rest of the car was designed with a different grille in mind. The rest of the exterior stays pretty much the same, with Lincoln only adding some chrome trim and subtly different lighting. In general, Lincoln left the MKC's cabin untouched. It already offers an exceptionally quiet, well-executed interior, so the lack of changes isn't a major issue. The same goes for the powertrains. Buyers can still choose between the 245-hp naturally aspirated 2.0-liter or the 285-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder. The updated MKC is also still available in Black Label trim, allowing buyers to choose from three different themes that add high-end leather and wood accents to the cabin. Lincoln also offers its fair share of safety features and modern technologies such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. An 8.0-inch touchscreen with Sync3 is also still standard and includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There's also an app called Lincoln Way, which allows owners to remotely control different features of their car. But ultimately, the updated MKC is pretty much the same as the current model. It gets new front-end styling, but that's the only significant change you'll see on the 2018 Lincoln MKC. We would have preferred to see improvements made to the handling, power delivery, and button-heavy center console, but it looks like we'll have to wait for the redesign to see those issues addressed.
AAsgkkY	autos	autosluxury	2017 Cadillac CTS 3.6L RWD	It's not the quickest, but it's fantastic to drive.	More spacious than the entry-level ATS and nimbler than the larger CT6, the Cadillac CTS is the American luxury brand's Goldilocks product. It's just right. Following last year's introduction of a new version of its mid-level V-6 engine, the CTS entered 2017 with a lightly restyled grille, a refreshed rear fascia, and a redesigned infotainment system. Cadillac also simplified its CTS lineup for the fourth model year of the third-generation car. The 3.6-liter V-6 is available in just two of the five trims: Luxury and Premium Luxury. The former starts at $54,690 and the latter, tested here, at $60,190. (Cadillac also sells the CTS with a turbocharged inline-four in the base and Luxury trims and with a twin-turbo V-6 in the V-Sport and V-Sport Premium Luxury. The CTS-V with a 640-hp supercharged V-8 is considered a separate model.) Extra Six-y The CTS's new 3.6-liter V-6 shares little with its predecessor. Even its displacement is slightly larger, at 3649 cubic centimeters rather than 3564. Power is now rated at 335 horses, 14 more than before, while torque climbs to 285 lb-ft at 5300 rpm from the previous 275 at 4800 rpm. All that grunt is sent to the rear wheels by way of an eight-speed automatic transmission controllable by a pair of meaty steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters made of magnesium. We tested a rear-drive model, but all-wheel drive is available for $2000 more. The added oomph paid dividends at the track, where this CTS went from zero to 60 mph in just 5.7 seconds 0.3 second better than a 2014 rear-drive model with the older engine. A quarter-mile time of 14.2 seconds at 101 mph bested the previous 14.6-second run at 99 mph. But that's not enough to trump the turbocharged six-cylinder BMW 540i, which eclipsed this Cadillac by a full second both to 60 mph and in the quarter-mile. The Bimmer also is rated at 335 horses but recorded a quarter-mile trap speed of 109 mph; credit its 332 lb-ft of torque developed over a broad rpm range and, perhaps, BMW's conservative power ratings. According to the EPA, the 3.6-liter CTS drinks 87 octane at a rate of 20 mpg in the city, 30 mpg on the highway, and 24 mpg combined. Over the course of our time with the Caddy, we observed an average of 20 mpg and recorded 27 mpg in our 75-mph highway fuel-economy test. Added Lightness This 3.6-liter CTS may not be the quickest option in its segment, but it certainly is among the most enjoyable to drive, as General Motors' Alpha platform remains the gold standard for dynamic behavior in the mid-size luxury-sedan segment. The sturdy structure provides the CTS with both sharp reflexes and a comfortable ride, while ample use of aluminum components keeps the CTS's heft in check. At 3795 pounds, this CTS weighed 276 pounds less than the aforementioned BMW 540i. Thanks to a responsive and communicative electrically assisted rack-and-pinion steering system, near 50/50 weight distribution, and a firm brake pedal with loads of feedback, the relatively lightweight CTS is an ideal partner on curvy roads. Our CTS Premium Luxury test car also benefited from standard adaptive dampers as well as the $1465 V-Sport package that adds specific suspension tuning, 13.6-inch front brake rotors (1.0 inch bigger than standard), a set of 18-inch wheels wrapped in Pirelli P Zero Run Flat summer tires, and a meatier three-spoke steering wheel. Around our 300-foot skidpad this CTS gripped the tarmac at 0.94 g, matching the lateral adhesion of a $136,975 Audi RS7 Performance we tested. Meanwhile, the CTS's standard Brembo front brake calipers worked with the V-Sport package's stickier tires and bigger brake rotors to bring the CTS to a halt from 70 mph in a fade-free 153 feet. Inferior Interior Unfortunately, the CTS's alluring chassis dynamics are let down by its interior. Fit and finish leave much to be desired, with our test car showing large panel gaps around the glovebox and noticeably misaligned wood trim. Additionally, this CTS featured a $395 dealer-installed, microsuede-wrapped steering wheel that feels great in your hands, but its appearance was cheapened by scrunches and wrinkles in the fabric. The CTS still suffers a comparatively cramped rear seat with 35.4 inches of legroom, down two inches from that in the Audi A6 and an inch to the BMW 5-series. At least the 60/40 split-folding bench is well cushioned, and the Premium Luxury model adds heaters to the outboard rear seats and a separate climate zone for the aft compartment. (Dual-zone automatic climate control and heated and ventilated front buckets are standard even on the lower-level 3.6-liter Luxury.) Our Premium Luxury test car also was equipped with the $2850 Technology package, which adds a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, aluminum pedals, 20-way power-adjustable front sport seats, automatically cinching seatbelts, an automated emergency braking system that operates when driving both forward and in reverse, adaptive cruise control, and additional security measures such as laminated rear windows and an upgraded alarm system. Other options included $1500 worth of Kona Brown leather seats, a coat of $595 Phantom Gray Metallic paint, a $525 dealer-installed rear spoiler, and a $250 extra-capacity cooling system, bringing this CTS's as-tested price up to $67,770 $6080 more than the base price for the 420-hp CTS V-Sport. CUE Wanted More Every 2017 CTS delivered to dealers after March 2017 benefits from the latest iteration of the Cadillac User Experience, better known as CUE. The all-new infotainment system features logically arranged menus and a simplified home screen that can show a condensed navigation map, climate-control information, basic radio controls, and pertinent phone information all on a single page. Anchored graphical buttons at the bottom-left corner of the 8.0-inch touchscreen make it easier to explore CUE's countless functions without getting lost within the system's many menus. The touchscreen also is more forgiving to slightly misaimed pokes and requires less fingertip pressure to respond. Not all issues have been solved, though, as CUE's troublesome touch-capacitive stereo volume and climate controls remain. Despite its imperfections, the Cadillac CTS remains the best vehicle that the American luxury brand produces as well as one of the most engaging mid-size luxury sedans.

Next time you head up to your attic, it may be worth taking a gander through your hoards of stuff. Over time, items can appreciate in value more than you think . So before you toss or donate anything, take a look at this list of 55 items that are worth a lot of money today and could be hiding in plain sight in your storage. Persian Rugs Handwoven Persian rugs appreciate a lot over the years although it takes a long time for that to happen. That rug your great-grandparent purchased may just be worth something now. Rugs that are more than 100 years old are considered antiques and their price is determined by size, material, knot-density, condition, and design. What it's worth: Between $1,000 and $1 million Julia Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' Julia Child is one of America's favorite chefs, and her first cookbook swept the nation when it was published in 1961. If you've hung onto an original copy, you may be in the market for more than just a satisfied appetite a first edition in good condition with the original jacket is rare and earns top dollar on Ebay. What it's worth: $2,000 and up Hand-Carved Duck Decoys Duck decoys became highly collectable in the mid-20th century and prices have never been higher for pristine items. If you've inherited one, you could earn up to hundreds of thousands of dollars at an auction. What it's worth: Up to $650,000 Beanie Babies The plush collectable toys that were popular in the 1990s have massive resale value on sites like Ebay, especially if the tag is still attached and the item is in mint condition. Some of the limited edition toys have sold for up to half a million dollars online. For example, one of the original Beanie Babies  a lobster named Pinchers  sells for $35,000. What it's worth: Up to $500,000 Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Vinyl Record If you've hung onto this popular 1967 record from The Beatles, you could be in luck. The resale value of the album on vinyl can go for up to $290,500 although most sell for a couple hundred dollars. What it's worth: Up to $290,500 Baseball Cards When pegging the value of baseball cards, the general rule is that the older they are, the more they are worth. There are a lot of nuances that determine a card's worth though, so if you've come across a hoard of old cards, it's worth getting them appraised. Based on variables like condition, player, and year, a card can be sold online for thousands of dollars. What it's worth: Up to $3.2 million Super Bowl Memorabilia If you were lucky enough to get your hands on a pair of Super Bowl tickets back in the day, you could earn a big payout from holding onto them. Most of these paper tickets have a blue or yellow stripe on the top which, according to Sports Collectors Daily , sell for between $200 to $1,000. If you held onto tickets with white stripes on top, you could make up to $4,000. Of course, it depends on the popularity of the game, as well. Super Bowl II and Super Bowl XII tickets are particularly rare. What it's worth: Up to $4,000 American Girl Samantha Dolls Samantha is one of the original American Girl dolls, and if yours is still in good condition with her original clothes and accessories, it could go for thousands of dollars . What it's worth: $600 to $3,300 Boy Scout Collectibles There's a real market online for Boy Scout collectibles, such as uniforms, equipment, commemorative items, and badges. Some badges sell for up to $30 a piece on eBay, while a first edition of the Boy Scout handbook recently sold for $2,200 online. What it's worth : Up to $2,200 Comic Books Of course, as with anything, rare comic books hold more value than common editions. In fact, a rare copy could be worth millions. But don't fret: More common books could still make you hundreds. Not too bad. What it's worth: Up to several million Windsor-Style Armchair Antiques Roadshow producer Marsha Bemko checked in with appraiser Stephen L. Fletcher of Skinner, Inc., who reports that your circa-1820s "Rod Back" Windsor Armchair was likely made in the New England area. "There were many makers of these types of chairs, so it's hard to trace it to a specific region or manufacturer," he says. While the paint and pin- striping appear to be original, the chair's legs have been cut off at some point, lowering its value. "The seat height should be about 17 inches," he says. "Yours was shortened to 14 1/2 inches, likely for comfort or because it was too tall for a table." What it's worth: $150 Vintage Toy Goat "While unmarked, your adorable goat is likely a German-Made Pull Toy, imported to the United States during the early 1900s," says appraiser Marsha Dixey. Some German-made plush toys were crafted of goat skin and real hair, but yours was constructed of papier-mâché and then flocked with a mix of natural fabric or paper fibers. Except for its disintegrated horns and missing pull string this toy appears to be in excellent condition, which keeps his value and charm high. What it's worth: $600 Portable Sewing Machine Sometimes called the "Micro Bell," your petite sewing machine is a 1950s Portable Bell Sewing Machine made by Freeland, Pennsylvania-based Bell Manufacturing Corp. Appraiser Helaine Fendelman says this small machine, which measures just 4 by 9 1/2 by 14 inches and weighs only 8 pounds when tucked into its leather attaché case, was intended for occasional home use and sewing on the go. All the necessary sewing accessories fit into tiny compartments tucked beneath the machine in its green baize-lined (a felt- like woolen material) case. "Although this little gem's value has not increased," says Helaine, "collectors love it because, when it's in good condition like yours, it still works very well as a portable machine." What it's worth: $125 Wood Chest While at first glance your piece appears to be an 1800s campaign chest, appraiser Christopher Barber of Skinner, Inc., shares with Antiques Roadshow 's Marsha Bemko that, unfortunately, it's only partly antique. "This Pine Blanket Chest has been significantly altered and refinished," he says. "The top section is late 18th to early 19th century, but the rest of it is more likely from the early 20th century." The brass binding also appears to have been added later in an effort to make it look like a campaign chest. So, while it's not very valuable, it's still a pretty piece worthy of showing off. What it's worth: $75 to $100 Wood Rolling Rack Appraiser Bene Raia of Raia Auctioneers says your rolling rack is an Early-20th-Century Baker's Rack that was used in the factory of a bread company. "The rack's open shelves were essential for letting air circulate around the freshly baked loaves, and the four steel casters allowed the bread to be moved quickly to packaging and distribution areas," she says. The primary wood material is oak along with some other mixed woods. Bene adds that the fact that your rack has been stripped and stained has minor impact on its value, because these pieces were produced in great quantity and are therefore not particularly rare. What it's worth: $300 ($425 in original condition) Coin Banks They might hold your pocket change, but old banks hiding out in your home might be worth a lot more. Though a simple piggy bank might not get you far, if you have something with a mechanical feature, you could be in luck. The Mechanical Bank Collectors of America have been seeking out these contraptions since 1958. What it's worth: Up to $2,500 First Edition Books Looks like being a bookworm could pay off. If you happen to have a first edition of a popular book, it could net you thousands of dollars. Sites like Biblio can help you determine how much cash is sitting on your bookshelf. What it's worth: $15,000+ (depending on how popular/old the book is) Boxes of Cereal You might not want to eat that box of cereal that's been hidden away for decades (for multiple reasons!), but there are collectors out there looking to buy vintage cereal boxes. Special edition boxes or cereals that are no longer in production could earn you big bucks, so now might be the time to bust out that E.T. cereal you've been hiding away. What it's worth: $100+ (based on on rarity of cereal or box) Costume Jewelry You don't need diamonds to make a little dough off of your jewelry. Old costume jewelry from designers like Elsa Schiaparelli are auctioned off at high price tags. What it's worth: Up to $2,000 Outdated Electronics It's all about keeping up with technology for most people, but don't go throwing out your old gadgets. There's a huge market for phones, computers, radios, video game systems (and video games, too), or even vintage toasters. In 2015, a woman threw away an Apple I computer valued at $200,000. What it's worth: Up to $10,000 Guitars and Other Instruments If you're storing any old musical pieces, better dust them off. Instruments, especially guitars, kept in good condition are worth a fortune. Gibson or Martin guitars from the 1960s or earlier are selling for thousands. What it's worth: Up to $33,000 Lamps The lamp you inherited that just didn't fit in with the rest of the room can possibly score you a wad of dough. Handel, Pairpoint, and Fulper are just a few of the brands that collectors are looking for. Pro tip: Sometimes even just having the base is enough. What it's worth: Up to $45,000 Lunch Boxes Still holding on to your old lunch box? Boxes featuring The Beatles, The Jetsons, and even Rambo can score a lot of cash. What it's worth: Up to $3,100 Christmas Ornaments Plenty of families pass down Christmas decorations, and if you have anything in your collection that's handmade, it could be worth a pretty penny. What it's worth: Up to $500 Perfume Bottles They just don't make 'em like they used to. Glassblowers throughout the world turned perfume bottles into an art form in the 19th century. If you have anything in pristine condition from companies like New England Glass Company or the Boston & Sandwich Glass Company, keep it somewhere safe until you get it appraised. What it's worth: Up to $1,000 Postcards As is the case with most of this list, the value of an old postcard depends on how old it is, how rare it is, and what condition it's in. A postcard from 1840 sold at auction in London in 2002 for $50,000. What it's worth: Up to $340 Silverware Time to bust out your grandmother's old dinnerware. Sets of sterling silverware can be worth anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. If you have a complete set from a big brand like Tiffany, you could be in for a real payday. What it's worth: Up to $1,100 Tools Head out back to the shed and see if you have any old saws, hand drills, or any other old tools that have seen better days. There are many price guides out there to teach you which ones to look out for. What it's worth: Up to $3,000 VHS Tapes The VCR days are long behind us, but you may want to hunt down those old VHS tapes. Unpopular movies that never made the leap to DVD or digital are the ones to look out for (especially in the horror genre). Movies that have been banned or deemed controversial (like Disney's Song of the South ) also go for a high price. What it's worth: Up to $50,000 Advertisements Vintage-style ads are popular for home decor and actual vintage ads are highly sought after as well. Everything from soft drinks to gasoline can get you paid. (This is especially true for anything with Coca-Cola branding.) What it's worth: Up to $15,000 Football Programs Early Harvard vs. Yale sports items are highly collectible, and turn-of-the-century examples like these can be difficult to find. "Of your three programs, the 1897 item is the most rare but also in poor condition," explains Marsha Dixey of Heritage Auctions. Meanwhile the 1899 and 1909 items are easier to come by but wonderfully preserved. Together the three relics commands a winning sum. What it's worth: $700 Soda Crates In the early 1900s, the burgeoning soda industry was made up of local drugstores who mixed and bottled small-batch recipes and delivered them in hand-stenciled crates. Today those rare boxes fetch up to $200. More recent specimens (like the 1950s and 1960s ones shown) go for $20. What it's worth: Up to $200 Dollhouse At nearly 6 feet wide, this circa 1924 Tudor was the largest ever built by the venerable British toymaker Lines Bros. Masterfully designed by carpenters and engineers, the stately house features shrunken versions of then-contemporary floral wallpaper, stucco walls, and mullioned glass windows. What it's worth: $2,000 Record Player "This RCA Vitor Slide-O-Matic record player is somewhat rare," says eBay's Jim Griffith. "This particular model dates back to the 1950s and made listening to a stack of 45s the only kind of record it plays pretty labor intensive," he says. "Records are inserted one at a time, so you basically listen to a single song before it's time to insert the next one." This model is less sought after than a later version that combined the record player and an AM radio in single device. What it's worth: $130 Luggage Set As air, rail, and ship travel took off in the 1950s, so did luggage sales. This trio of hard-sided suitcases hails from that golden era, when green marble finishes were all the rage. "Made by Towncraft, a J.C. Penney house brand, this set copies a Samsonite design, which was then one of the leaders of the industry," explains appraiser Helaine Fendelman. Single cases aren't worth much more than their original 1950s price (about $25). But because these are in good condition (no stains, tears, or undesirable smells lurking inside) and are a matched set, they go for a tidy sum. What it's worth: $175 for the set Belly Board This board was made in the 1960s by the same man who invented Ugg boots. The name for this type of board "Paipo" comes from the word "Pae Poo," Hawaiian for "headfirst." Heritage Auctions' Marsha Dixey says that Stedman's name was referenced several times in her research, so that adds to its value. What it's worth: $500 Upside-Down Ball Mason Jar Issued only from 1900 to 1910, this jar could double as a dispenser for a coffee grinder. The short production window gives it considerable cache. What it's worth: $1,000 Milk Glass Banana Stand Victorians wanted a dish for everything; bananas were no exception. This 1950s reproduction, used here as a flower display, features a lace edge and holds a value of $45. What it's worth: One from the early 1900s could fetch up to $100. Cast-Iron Mailbox This early-20th-century mailbox carries cachet because it was produced by Griswold, one of the most sought-after makers of cast iron. In operation from 1865 until 1957, the company specialized in cookware, but ardent cast-iron collectors are interested in all forms. This No. 3 mailbox from 1910 is no exception. Unpainted examples are valued at $350; because this one bears an unoriginal, though eye-catching, green paint job, its value is considerably less, says Marsha Dixey of Heritage Auctions. What it's worth: $125 Ball Jug Sold in limited quantities in the 1940s by Anchor Hocking, these pitches are now the most coveted single pieces of jadeite. Even damaged specimens (they're prone to stress cracks around the neck and handle) go for $150. What it's worth: $400 Violet Columbia Mason Jar Manganese added to the jars created a purple tint when exposed to the sun. The color was initially an error, but manufacturers began selling the popular shade in 1905. What it's worth: $400 Typewriter The Brooklyn-based Royal Typewriter company introduced their portable version in 1926l the serial number on this Quiet De Luxe model dates it precisely to 1957. While other companies made portables Remington, Underwood, Smith Corona to name just a few none could compete with this one. Designed to minimize the clackety-clack of the keys, it was the top of the line at the time, says antiques expert Helaine Fendelman. But the real page-turner is its color. Common black models don't go for much, while bubblegum pink is a rare find. Because many examples still exist, scratches and dents would devalue the piece considerably. Fortunately, this one is in bang-up shape. What it's worth: $375 Sheet Music Cabinet This cupboard is actually a Classical Revival-style music cabinet that was made in the late 19th century in England, according to appraiser Helaine Fendelman. But it wasn't designed to hold records. "The upper shelves and vertical separations enclosed by the door originally held sheet music organized by category, size, or type," she says. What it's worth: $2,500 Rocking Chair "Whether you call this chair Arts and Crafts, Mission, or Craftsman, it's really cute," says Heritage Auction's Marsha Dixey. "However I don't believe Stickley made chairs with the type of design features the cutouts, for instance of your rocker, so I wouldn't expect there to be a maker mark embossed in the wood." The chair is in good condition though, and worth holding onto. What it's worth: $200 Weather Vane "The rust here is suspicious," explains Helaine Fendelman of Appraisers Association of America. "Wind blows irregularly, and the rusted sections seem to be in all the wrong places. Also, an authentic example would probably have been cut from one piece of iron, not from multiples." If it were really a 19th-century antique, this item would be worth far more between $5,000 and $7,000. What it's worth: $200 Lounge Chair The set it by Milo Baughman, a pioneer of modern design who began collaborating with North Carolina-based furnituremaker Thayer Coggin in the 1950s. (Baughman's work has even been on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art.) Antiques expert Helaine Fendelman notes that Baughman's work led to midcentury-modern classics that are still in demand today. What it's worth: $1,500 for set Circa 1900 Dining Chairs These are English oak dining chairs with original leather seats and barley twist legs, which are considered Gothic Revival, says Marsha Dixey of Heritage Auctions. The value rests on the well-kept condition of all six chairs in the set. What it's worth: $600 for set Pearl and Cameo Bracelet Heritage Auctions' Marsha Dixey consulted with Jill Burgum, who says that the carved cameos are from the late Victorian age when the mourning trend of black clothing and jewelry became popular. They were likely two separate brooches or pendants that were later converted into a bracelet years later. What it's worth: $250 Sterling Silver Belt Buckle This buckle is marked "R. Schaezlein & Son," the name of a San Francisco silversmith founded in 1882 that was renowned for its Western wear. The backstamp dates this piece to the 1990s, explains Marsha Dixey of Heritage Auctions. What it's worth: $500 1960s Stetson Hat In 1865, John Batterson Stetson created the first cowboy hat. His design's wide brim shaded the neck and eyes, and when turned upside down, the crown could hold water for a horse or rider, says antiques appraiser Helaine Fendelman. This model, with its original box, dates to the 1960s. Despite a few small stains, the famed Stetson name brings a handsome estimate. What it's worth: $175 Yo-Yo Quilt "Hundreds of cotton circles were cut and hand-sewn otgether to make this coverlet," explains Marsha Bemko of Antiques Roadshow , who consulted with Deborah Miler. It was a popular style in the 1930s, when the Yo-Yo toy was an American fad, hence the quirky name. What it's worth: $275 Loving Cup This piece is a loving cup meant for sharing celebratory drinks at a wedding or banquet. The backstamp indicated it was made by Philadelphia silversmith Peter L. Krider for renowned retailer Shreve, Crump & Low. Dated 1899, it sports impressive horn handles that channel an end-of-the-century interest in hunting, says appraiser Helaine Fendelman. What it's worth: $700 Hooked Rug In the early 1800s, enterprising Yankees created a cottage industry sewing fabric scraps into rag rugs. Hand-hooked versions (made by using a sailor's hook to pull scraps through a burlap backing) soon followed. This early-20th-century hand-hooked wool runner is a close descendant of those New England predecessors, says antiques appraiser Helaine Fendelman. What it's worth: $750 Milk Glass Easter Eggs These delicate handblown milk glass eggs were originally sold blank so that Victorian ladies could embellish them with spring greetings and scenes. Over time, the sentiments were usually damaged by washing or handling, says Marsha Dixey of Heritage Auctions. This group, however, is in great condition with minimal wear. What it's worth: $775 for set Trunk This stunning item dates back to the 1870s, when luggage had to withstand wagon travel, says Marsha Dixey. The interior has multiple storage compartments and is fully lined with its original lithographed paper. The large size is impressive but hardly surprising: Wealthy people of this era typically decamped for the entire summer to places like Saratoga Springs, New York, the popular warm-weather destination for which this dome-topped style is named. What it's worth: $700

The Federal Reserve and CD rates When the Federal Reserve makes interest rate decisions, the rates that banks offer on CDs can change. The Fed can choose to raise or lower the federal funds rate. Once the central bank makes a decision to change the rate, banks will generally move CD yields in the same direction. Broader macroeconomic conditions also influence CD rates. CD rates typically follow the direction of the Federal Reserve closely. For example, in 2020, the Fed made two emergency cuts and CD rates have been declining at some banks to protect their profits. How are CD interest rates determined? CD rates are determined by several factors. The decisions made by the Federal Reserve on the federal funds rate will influence CD rates. Competition among banks and credit unions will also influence the payout out on their CDs as well as whether the financial institution needs deposits or not. In general, online banks tend to pay higher rates than banks with branches. Changes in Treasury yields and economic conditions also influence CD rates. Learn more: What is a certificate of deposit?

BBUkAzR	entertainment	celebrity	Celeb couples with big age gaps	Age is just a number for some stars!	Age is just a number for some stars! When it comes to falling head-over-heels in love, a lot of stars just don't care about age. After all, it's just a number, right?! Wonderwall.com rounded up a slew of celebrity couples with a significant number of years between them, including this pair... On April 12, 2020, 46-year-old Kate Beckinsale was photographed holding hands with 22-year-old Canadian musician Goody Grace while on a walk in Los Angeles. DailyMail.com reported that the pair -- who have nearly 24 years between them -- were first spotted spending time together in January 2020. Goody is just a year and a half older than Kate's daughter, Lily Sheen. Keep reading for more on the British actress's romances with younger men, plus other celeb couples with big age gaps... Kate Beckinsale is living her best life -- she's romanced significantly younger men before... She and comedian Pete Davidson were first linked in January 2019 when the actress was 45 and the "Saturday Night Live" comedian was 25. Over the next few months, they flaunted their budding romance with PDA in both Los Angeles and New York City . They ultimately split after less than four months of casually dating. In 2017, Kate dated comedian Matt Rife, who's 22 years her junior, and in 2018, she shared a steamy, PDA-filled night out at a Los Angeles nightclub with British comedian Jack Whitehall, who's nearly 15 years younger than her. In April 2019, actor-director Zach Braff was photographed holding hands in New York City with "Fighting With My Family," "Little Women" and "Black Widow" actress Florence Pugh, who was newly 23 at the time. The pair -- who have 21 years between them -- later took their romance more public. Nicolas Cage was 56 when he made his public debut with new girlfriend Riko Shibata at the Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, California, on Feb. 8, 2020. A few weeks later, Britain's The Sun and DailyMail.com reported that Riko -- seen here with Nic in New York City on March 3, 2020 -- is 30 years the actor's junior and three years younger than his eldest son, Weston. Dennis Quaid and Laura Savoie have a 39-year age difference between them. The actor was 65 and the college student was 26 when they were photographed together in Los Angeles in May 2019 (reports revealed they'd been dating for several months at the time). Dennis proposed in Hawaii in October 2019. Laura, who was valedictorian of her class at Pepperdine University and previously dated actor Jeremy Piven, has been working toward her doctorate in accounting at the University of Texas. But this isn't the first time Dennis romanced a significantly younger woman... Dennis Quaid and Santa Auzina turned heads when they began dating in late 2016. Why? Their good looks, obviously, but also their 32-year age difference. Fun fact: When he started seeing the model, he was more than twice her age. In May 2017, reports swirled claiming that David Foster, then 67, and Katharine McPhee, then 32, were dating , which came as quite a shock to many, considering their 34-year age difference. However, the musician-producer and the singer-actress didn't let that get in the way of their love, and they were practically attached at the hip by late 2017. Then, in July 2018, they got engaged while on vacation in Italy. David and Katharine married almost a year later in London in June 2019. This power couple has overcome far more than an age gap! Beyonce is 12 years younger than husband JAY-Z , whom she started dating when she was 19. In 2003, Bey released her smash hit single "Crazy in Love" featuring Jay, which was reportedly inspired by the beginning stages of their romance. The "Everything Is Love" musical duo tied the knot in 2008 and now share three children -- daughter Blue Ivy Carter and twins Sir and Rumi. In October 2016, the world learned that Sean Penn , then 56, was romancing actress Leila George , then 24, after they were photographed sharing some PDA in the ocean. More than three years later in January 2020, the couple -- who have nearly 32 years between them -- made their official solo red carpet debut as a couple at a Haiti charity even in Los Angeles. Sean, by the way, is only a year younger than Leila's father, actor Vincent D'Onofrio. In 2003, "How to Get Away with Murder" star Viola Davis married Julius Tennon, who's 13 years her senior. According to the actress, she prayed for a man in her life, and three weeks later, there he was! "I asked for a husband who was emotionally available, someone who was older, someone who maybe had a family before," she told Essence magazine in 2013. "I like older men. Someone from the South. Someone who loves God more than he loves himself." Viola and Julius have been happily married since 2003! They share daughter Genesis. On July 17, 2019 -- not long after it emerged that they were dating -- Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who was 50 at the time, took to Twitter to reveal that he and then-25-year-old Swedish actress Anna Lundberg were expecting a baby together. "Very happy to let everyone know that my partner Anna and I are expecting a little angel of our own," the "Good Omens" star wrote. They welcomed daughter Lyra that September. In January 2020, Pamela Anderson tied the knot for the fifth time, marrying "A Star is Born" producer Jon Peters -- who's 22 years her senior -- in Malibu. But just 12 days later, it was over. The couple first dated 30 years earlier when Pam was 22 and Jon was 44 (they're seen here in 1989). There's a 24-year age gap between "Jeopardy!" host Alex Trebek and his wife. The game show legend, who was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer at 78 in early 2019, and Jean Currivan Trebek, 54, married in 1990 when she was 26. Shortly before his diagnosis, Alex told People magazine that his one regret in life was that he and Jean hadn't been together longer. "My wife Jean and I have been together almost 29 years, and I was thinking about President Bush when he died, and all the comments about his life about what a nice guy he is, and how he and his wife had been together 73 years," Alex said. "I thought, oh my gosh... if I'd just met Jean in my 20s we could have had a longer life together. I guess if I'd met her when I was in my 20s, she wouldn't have been born yet. But hey, 29 years is pretty good!" There's a 32-year age gap between Sarah Paulson and girlfriend Holland Taylor. "There's a poignancy to being with someone older," the "American Horror Story" star told The New York Times in 2016. "I think there's a greater appreciation of time and what you have together and what's important." Heidi Klum is 16 years older than third husband Tom Kaulitz. In 2018, the model gushed about her then-boyfriend to InStyle. "My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it," she said. "That's really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it. I don't really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles." The model mogul and the German rocker tied the knot in 2019 when he was 29 and she was 45. Scott Disick was 34 years old when he and Sofia Richie began dating in 2017 -- not long after she turned 18. "Full House" alum John Stamos met wife Caitlin McHugh -- who's 22 years his junior -- while shooting an episode of "Law and Order: SVU" in 2015. After nearly two years of dating, John proposed at one of her favorite places -- Disneyland! The couple married in February 2018 when he was 54 and she was 31. They welcomed their first child, son Billy, that same year. Richard Gere is 34 years older than his wife, Spanish socialite Alejandra Silva. The duo was first spotted out together as a couple in June 2015. They quietly tied the knot in April 2018 and welcomed their first child together in 2019. Their second is due in 2020. "Oceans 12" star Vincent Cassel is 30 years older than his wife, model Tina Kunakey. The couple tied the knot in August 2018 when he was 51 and she was 21 and welcomed a daughter the following year. They began dating when Tina was 19. Gavin Rossdale and Sophia Thomalla began dating in April 2017 when he was 51 and she was 27. And get this: The German model is actually one year younger than Gavin's eldest child, daughter Daisy Lowe. They split in late 2018. There's a 13-year age difference between "The Greatest Showman" star Hugh Jackman and his real-life leading lady, Deborra-lee Furness. The couple met in 1995 on the set of "Correlli," an Australian television series. After admitting they had crushes on each other (how cute!) they began dating, and the rest is history! They married less than a year later when Hugh was 27 and Deborra-lee was 40. They now share two kids, Oscar and Ava. Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra started off as friends, but things turned romantic in the summer of 2018 and they got serious in a hurry. Priyanka, who's 10 years older than Nick, even introduced him to her mom within weeks! Within the first few weeks of dating, they couple was seen in India, Brazil, New York City and Los Angeles -- and they were engaged by the end of July. On Dec. 1, 2018, they married in India when the actress was 36 and the singer was 26. George Clooney met the love of his life in 2013. The long-time bachelor fell hard for Amal Alamuddin, an international law and human rights attorney, and the two were married a year later in Venice, Italy, when George was 53 and Amal was 36. The 17-year age difference never seemed to be a factor for the duo, who welcomed twins in 2017. Art imitates life! Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander co-starred as husband and wife in the 2016 flick "The Light Between Two Oceans." An 11-year age difference was hardly a problem for the couple -- in 2017, they tied the knot in Spain when Michael was 40 and Alicia was 29. There's a 35-year age difference between Randy Jackson and his musician girlfriend, Simone. But it doesn't faze this duo. You want perspective? She was born when George H.W. Bush was in the White House. Randy, however, was born when Dwight D. Eisenhower was commander in chief. "One Tree Hill" actress Hilarie Burton and "The Walking Dead" star Jeffrey Morgan are separated by 16 years. That makes no difference to them. The couple began dating in 2009 when she was 26 and he was 42 and wed in 2019. They share two children. There's a nearly 26-year age difference between Alec Baldwin and his second wife, former yoga instructor Hilaria Baldwin, who's now the mother of his four youngest children. They wed in 2012 when he was 54 and she was 28. Josh Duhamel and Eiza Gonzalez didn't let their 17-year age difference get in the way of their romance. The couple began dating in June 2017, five months after he and music star Fergie announced that they were separating. After about a year of dating, Josh and Eiza split. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones have been married since 2000. They treaded some rocky waters and separated for a short while in 2013 but are happy together now. Michael is 25 years older than the Oscar-winning actress, whom he wed when he was 56 and she was 31. Steven Tyler hired Aimee Preston as his assistant in 2012 when she was just 23 years old. The two hit it off and made their public debut as a couple in February 2016 when Steven was 68 and she was 27. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a 41-year difference in age. (Aimee is actually younger than two of Steven's daughters.) Dane Cook and Kelsi Taylor started dating in 2017 when she was 18 and he was 44. On their one-year anniversary, Dane posted a picture of himself with his love, writing, "Kelsi thank you for so many nights filled with laughter, days filled with creative thoughts & expressions and mostly thx for the love." She posted a picture as well, writing, "I have the most amazing guy by my side with the sweetest of hearts. I love you with all of mine." Twenty-five years is nothing! That's the span of the age gap between Kardashian family matriarch Kris Jenner and boyfriend Corey Gamble, who's a year younger than her eldest daughter, Kourtney Kardashian. The two have been an item since November 2014. It was essentially love at first sight for director Sam Taylor-Johnson and Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The pair met on the set of the Sam-helmed 2009 biopic "Nowhere Boy," back when the actor was just 18. But despite their 24-year age gap, and meeting when Aaron was just venturing into adulthood, they managed to defy the odds. The lovebirds tied the knot in 2012 and have two daughters, Wylda and Romy. Can you believe there's a 20-year age gap between Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jason Statham ?! They don't look two decades apart in age! The British lovebirds have been together since 2010, got engaged in 2016 and welcomed their first child in 2017. Kelsey Grammer was married and divorced three times before finding love again with a 27-years-younger Kayte Walsh, who happens to be just two years older than his eldest daughter, actress Spencer Grammer. Sylvester Stallone was 42 in 1988 when he began dating model Jennifer Flavin, who was 19 at the time. The couple tied the knot in 1997. They now share three daughters -- Sistine, Sophia and Scarlett. The "Rocky" writer-actor gushed to The Telegraph in 2010 about his wife, "I realized that women have a knack, at least Jennifer, for making incredibly erudite, wise, smart decisions," he said. "I always leap without looking. She always looks and never leaps. She's incredibly safe. So now finally, I say: 'Honey, you make all the decisions. Done, done, done. I trust you.' I never had that before. Ever." Mel Gibson's latest girlfriend is 35 years his junior! The actor-director welcomed his ninth child -- son Lars -- with champion equestrian vaulter-turned-screenwriter Rosalind Ross in early 2017 when he was 61 and she was 26. Susan Crow is Tony Bennett's third wife, and she is 40 years younger than the singer, to whom she's been married since 2007. In Tony's memoir, "Just Getting Started," he wrote that he "met" Susan when her mother was pregnant with her during a meet-and-greet in New York in 1966. Weird. Here's a fun fact about Bruce Willis : His second and current wife, Emma Heming, is 10 years older than his eldest daughter, Rumer Willis. The action star is 24 years older than his wife! Not only is David Hasselhoff 's wife 27 years his junior, but she has the same name as one of his kids.

The couple moved into his multi-million-dollar London home just weeks after his divorce from his wife was finalized in November 2015. David Cross and Amber Tamblyn, who randomly met and connected on a flight to Louisiana in 2009, tied the knot back in 2012. The funnyman is 19 years older than the actress, who gave birth to their daughter in February 2017. Comedian Kathy Griffin loves to crack jokes about the 18-year age gap between herself and marketing exec Randy Bick. The couple tied the knot in January 2020 when the actress was 59. Camila Alves and Matthew McConaughey have a 14-year age difference between them and have been together since 2007. The happy couple married in 2012 and have three gorgeous children together: sons Levi and Livingston and daughter Vida. Daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is 15 years older than wife Portia de Rossi. The couple married at their home in Los Angeles in 2008. Patti LaBelle was 70 when she got together with ex-boyfriend Eric Seats, who was 40 at the time. (Fun fact: Patti's son Zuri is a year older than Eric.) The couple seem to have gone their separate ways -- in 2019, the R&B icon told the New York Post that she was single and looking for a husband. Seventeen years isn't the only thing that separates French banker Olivier Sarkozy and wife Mary-Kate Olsen . The couple is also more than a foot apart in height: He's 6-foot-3 while the former "Full House" actress-turned-fashion mogul is 5-foot-2. They wed in 2015 . Her twin sister likes older men too... Richard Sachs is 28 years older than Ashley Olsen , but that didn't stop them from kissing at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in New York City in November 2016. The two dated for five months before splitting in March 2017. When Doug Hutchison and Courtney Stodden got hitched in 2011, she was not only 34 years younger than the actor but also just 16 years old. The off-and-on couple separated in September 2017 and the former teen bride filed for divorce in March 2018. Jerry Seinfeld and wife Jessica Seinfeld tied the knot in 1999 when she was 28 and he was 45 after just a year of dating. The couple -- who have a 17-year age gap between them -- first crossed paths at a gym while Jessica was newly married to her first husband. Now they share three children -- Sascha, Julian and Shepherd. Late music manager Rene Angelil met and started working with Celine Dion when she was just 12 years old and he was 38. The superstar singer didn't marry Rene until she was 26 (he was 52). One of the gold standards of age defying romances are Warren Beatty and Annette Bening. The longtime couple is 21 years apart in age. They first met in 1991 while filming "Bugsy." They married a year later, and they now have four kids together. Madonna has romanced quite a few super-hot younger men! Take Brazilian model Jesus Luz, for example: The couple had a 29-year age gap when they dated back in 2009. It wasn't a huge surprise when late Playboy founder Hugh Hefner tied the knot with a woman who was 60 years younger -- Crystal Hefner -- in 2012. After all, the majority of his ex-girlfriends have been a lot, lot younger. Dancer-choreographer Casper Smart and Jennifer Lopez broke up in August 2016 after being off and on for the better part of five years. Casper is 18 years younger than the superstar. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard went through a difficult divorce in 2016 after barely a year of marriage. Johnny is 23 years older than his ex! When Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore wed in 2005, she was labeled a cougar because of their 15-year age difference. Her eldest daughter, Rumer Willis, was only 10 years younger than her then-stepfather. After their divorce in 2013, Ashton linked up with actress Mila Kunis, who is much closer to him in age. (Ashton is only five years older than Mila.) Billionaire businessman Elon Musk and Canadian singer Grimes made their first public appearance as a couple at the 2018 Met Gala . In January 2020, the "Oblivion" singer announced that she was expecting a child with the Tesla founder -- who is 16 years her senior. Bradley Cooper and model Suki Waterhouse split in March 2015 after dating for almost two years. Could their 17-year age gap have been a factor? Golden Globe Award-winning actor Christian Slater is 18 years older than wife Brittany Lopez. In 2013, the couple married at a Miami courthouse after three years of dating when the actor was 44. In 2019, they welcomed their first child together, a daughter. Former "Friends" star David Schwimmer was dedicated to part-time photographer Zoe Buckman from 2007 to 2017. The two secretly tied the knot in 2010 and welcomed a daughter, Cleo, the following year -- despite David being 19 years Zoe's senior. Actress Rosario Dawson began dating Democratic politician Cory Booker -- who is 10 years her senior -- in 2018 when she was 39 and he was 49. Jonathan Bricklin and Susan Sarandon raised eyebrows for their 30-year age gap when they started dating after her high-profile split from Tim Robbins. Although Susan didn't mind being the older woman, she ultimately split with Jonathan after six years. Martin Mica didn't seem to mind the 30-year age gap between himself and former love Sharon Stone. They were a pretty darn good-lookin' couple, wouldn't you say? Kate Upton and Justin Verlander tied the knot in 2017 and welcomed their first child in 2019. The model is nine years younger than her baseball player husband, whom she wed at 25. Mariah Carey was married to Tommy Mottola (pictured), who's 21 years her senior, from 1993 to 1998. She then wed Nick Cannon, who's 10 years younger than her, in 2008. After they broke up, Mariah got engaged to the more age-appropriate Australian billionaire James Packer, who's only three years older than her. After they split, she quickly moved on with dancer Bryan Tanaka, who's 14 years her junior. Could the 35 years between Clint Eastwood and Dina Eastwood be one of the reasons their marriage failed? The couple divorced in 2014.
AA3ggk0	autos	autosnews	Verdict: 2007 Mini Cooper S	During our 20,000-plus-mile, 12-month run with the recently departed 2007 Cooper S, editors offered up all manner of opinions about the second-generation, slightly bigger Mini. Take a look at the long term verdict of the 2007 Mini Cooper S brought to you by the automotive experts at Motor Trend.	During our 20,000-plus-mile, 12-month run with the recently departed 2007 Cooper S, editors offered up all manner of opinions about the second-generation, slightly bigger Mini. There was much love for how the Cooper S handled at the track and over smooth stretches of twisty mountain road, yet much disdain for an around-town drive that loosened fillings and jolted spines over even minor road imperfections. Some pined for a manual transmission, while others warmed quickly to the six-speed automatic with paddle shifters and a sport mode designed to hold the revs longer. Just about everyone launched a few broadsides in the direction of the Mini's cabin, which, much like that of the previous car, proved a borderline ergonomic disaster. But despite everything that annoyed us about it -- the awkward seat adjustment, difficult-to-use window switches, weak nav/entertainment-system controls, and balky armrest, to name a few -- the Mini's interior still scored some style points, thanks to retro cues and an attractive blend of materials. New for the 2007 model year, the second-gen Mini's 1.6-liter, 172-horse/177-pound-foot turbocharged DOHC 16-valve I-4 proved stout and delivered an impressive power surge when needed -- enough, in fact, to propel it from 0 to 60 in a brisk 6.2 seconds. And while many wished for a manual gearbox, in the end we found the six-speed auto perfectly competent and adequate fun. With a 64/36 front bias, the Cooper S is never going to be completely devoid of torque steer, but our sport-suspended, Lightning Blue hatchback showed that front drive and fun-to-drive needn't be mutually exclusive. Mini and road trip don't exactly go together like cake and ice cream, but our car scooted on two extended jaunts. One was a 1050-mile round trip photographer extraordinaire Brian Vance took up to Northern California on a family ski outing. Like everyone else in the office, when the going got twisty, Vance attacked the turns in the British runabout and had a blast. And he averaged about 27.5 mpg during the trek, an especially frugal number considering the hard driving. The Cooper S provided just enough room for photography gear and luggage as well as gifts for the family, but with the Mini being as mini as it is, there were issues. "Despite all the clever, distinctive interior design Mini gave this car," says Vance, "it has neglected to put much storage space within the driver's reach. There are a couple of hard-to-access cupholders below the center stack, a map pocket in the door, and a shallow U-shaped area under the handbrake. I had troubling stashing my phone, iPod, aux cord, and spare change." The other excursion our Mini embarked upon was an epic, 4800-mile cross-country journey at the hands of our resident Mini maniac, Truck Trend Web producer Melissa Spiering. She took the Cooper S to "Minis on the Dragon," a pilgrimage to one of the most famous roads in the nation-a 300-turn, 11-mile stretch of Highway 129 known as "The Dragon," a bend-fest that winds its way through the Great Smoky Mountains between North Carolina and Tennessee. She had the time of her life zipping up and down the famed Dragon and mingling with the 500 other Mini owners. On her way back, in Arizona, the Mini's service light finally came on just after the 17,000-mile mark, and Spiering paid a visit to North Scottsdale Mini for the Cooper S's first service. Mini provides free maintenance for up to three years or 36,000 miles, so Spiering was able to keep the credit card in her wallet. Other than that service, the only other times we had the Mini in the shop were to fix a cracked windshield ($1376.87) and replace worn-out tires ($836.95)-lots of hard driving will do that. We were also annoyed by the center armrest, the top of which tended to slide around. Takeaways from our year with the Cooper S: Think long and hard about adding the sport suspension. Combined with the run-flat tires, it makes for a teeth-chattering ride. The Mini's "quirky" interior will get on your nerves-while it's big inside for the car's size and the new model is slightly bigger overall, they don't call it a Mini for nothing. Most important, though, our Mini delivered almost unbelievable mileage, zipped in and out of tight spaces with aplomb, was a hoot to drive aggressively, and had a wealth of premium features, all at a semi-reasonable price. And that's more than enough for us to recommend it. From The Logbook "The trans gives the best response and control of anything I've felt from a non-Audi. Suspension is softer but still a beat-you-up kind of fun factor. I don't find myself relaxed at the end of the drive. More like after a good run, flush with endorphins." - Mark Williams "I was prepared to hate this thing. A Mini Cooper S! With an automatic! Are we really car guys? Then I drove it. The six speed auto is a gem. It just surfs the ton of torque pumped out by that turbo four, and you always seem to be in precisely the right gear." - Angus Mackenzie "The most irritating thing about the Mini is its interior design. The window switches seem almost designed to get blocked behind loaded cupholders; the confusing and difficult to operate ventilation controls; the seatback reclining knobs wedged between armrest and seat; the turn stalks that offer zero tactile feel; and the armrest, which feels cheap and flimsy-all add up to an experience that's a disaster in ergonomics and logic." - Rory Jurnecka Our Car Base price $21,850 Options Nav system ($2100), Sport Package ($1400): 17-inch wheels, Dynamic Stability Control, Xenon headlamps, auto trans ($1350), HiFi sound system ($550), comfort access system ($500), Laser Blue metallic paint ($450), Sports leather steering wheel ($350), automatic air-conditioning ($300), heated front seats ($270), center armrest ($200) MSRP, as tested $29,320 Total mileage 20,093 Avg econ/CO2 25.0 mpg Problem areas Broken center armrest Maintenance cost $0 (mfr provided) Normal-wear cost $836.95 (Replace tires) 3-year residual value $17,885* Recalls None *Automotive lease guide data 2008 Mini Cooper S POWERTRAIN/CHASSIS Drivetrain layout Front engine, AWD Engine Type Turbocharged I-4, alum block/head Valvetrain DOHC, 4 valves/cyl Displacement 97.5 cu in/1598 cc Compression ratio 10.5:1 Power (SAE net) 172 hp @ 5500 rpm Torque (SAE net) 177 lb-ft @ 1600 rpm Redline 6500 rpm Weight to power 15.7 lb/hp Transmission 6-speed automatic Axle/final/low ratio 3.69:1/2.48:1 Suspension, front; rear Struts, coil springs, anti-roll bar; multilink, coil springs, anti-roll bar Steering ratio 14.1:1 Turns lock-to-lock 2.4 Brakes, f;r 11.6-in vented disc; 10.2-in disc, ABS Wheels 6.5 x 17-in, cast aluminum Tires 205/45R17 84V, Dunlop SP Sport 01 DSST DIMENSIONS Wheelbase 97.1 in Track, f/r 57.2/57.5 in Length x width x height 146.2 x 66.3 x 55.4 in Turning circle 35.1 ft Curb weight 2704 lb Weight dist., f/r 64/36% Seating capacity 4 Headroom, f/r 38.8/37.6 in Legroom 41.4/29.9 in Shoulder room, f/r 50.3/44.7 in Cargo Room 5.7 cu ft TEST DATA Acceleration to mph 0-30 2.1 sec 0-40 3.2 0-50 4.5 0-60 6.2 0-70 8.0 0-80 10.5 0-90 13.9 Passing, 45-65 mph 3.2 sec Quarter mile 14.8 sec @ 92.1 mph Braking, 60-0 mph 119 ft Lateral acceleration 0.86 g (avg) MT figure eight 26.9 sec @ 0.64 g (avg) Top-gear revs at 60 mph 2400 rpm CONSUMER INFO Stability/traction control Yes/yes Airbags Dual front, front side Basic warranty 4 yrs/50,000 miles Powertrain warranty 4 yrs/50,000 miles Roadside assistance 4 yrs/50,000 miles Fuel capacity 13.2 gal EPA city/hwy econ 23/32 mpg* Co2 emissions 0.67 lb/mile Required fuel Premium *Based on 2008 readings
BBGKNlv	autos	autossuvs	2018 Chevrolet Equinox Diesel AWD	Please ignore the idle clatter.	After years of living under a dark cloud in the United States, 2015 was shaping up to be the year affordable diesel-powered passenger vehicles would make a serious mark. Volkswagen, long a torchbearer for the technology in America, was reporting strong sales, Mazda was working to certify its Euro-market diesel, General Motors was readying its second-gen 2017 Chevrolet Cruze diesel, and several other manufacturers were, for the first time in decades, studying the viability of diesels for stateside duty. Then, as if on cue, the VW diesel scandal broke and it was back to square one. Research Chevrolet's latest models on MSN Autos But while VW was busy cleaning up its mess and Mazda continues to fiddle with its entry, the Chevrolet Cruze diesel hit the streets running clean. (EPA-compliant diesel vehicles also are available from BMW, Jaguar, and Land Rover, but they cost thousands more and attract a different demographic.) GM's turbo-diesel 1.6-liter inline-four engine is now available in the dramatically improved, new-for-2018 Equinox compact crossover, too, so we snagged one to see if it's a genuine fuel sipper with usable bottom-end grunt or just a clattery addition to the 1.5- and 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engines already in the lineup. Clatter Chatter Let's get this out of the way up front: If you are standing next to the diesel Equinox when it fires up from a cold slumber, there's no mistaking that a compression-ignition engine is under the hood. The cabin is substantially louder at idle we measured 43 decibels in the diesel versus 39 in an Equinox 1.5T but that additional hum isn't obnoxious or off-putting. And as the engine warms to operating temperature, even its outside bark grows subdued, and the masses will be none the wiser to the absence of spark plugs under the hood. While a 137-hp turbo-diesel engine may not immediately conjure the promise of performance, it does provide enough motivation for just about any type of situation you're likely to encounter while behind the wheel of a compact SUV. That includes chirping the tires, albeit in its own special way: Putting your foot to the floor results in a lackadaisical step-off followed by a swell of torque that comes on and breaks the tires free while rolling at about 5 mph. All 240 lb-ft of torque are on board at a low 2000 rpm, and peak horsepower arrives at 3750 rpm; combined, they make the zone between 1800 and 4400 rpm fertile ground for harvesting acceleration. The six-speed automatic transmission is astutely tuned for the 1.6's unique properties and makes no qualms about downshifting at the slightest provocation of the throttle to make the most of it. Whereas the Cruze diesel gets a nine-speed automatic, GM claims that transmission offered no fuel-economy benefits in the Equinox so it gets the carryover six-speed gearbox. Additionally, the diesel utilizes a taller 2.89:1 final-drive ratio whereas the nine-speed cars use either a 3.17, 3.50, or 3.87 final drive, depending on engine, transmission, and driveline combination. Given the Chevy's entertaining performance when booted around town, we were surprised by the less than impressive hard numbers: 9.4 seconds from zero to 60 mph and a quarter-mile time of 17.2 seconds with a trap speed of 80 mph. In real-world scenarios such as entering an interstate, that means keeping your foot to the floor for at least 10 seconds or longer in states such as Michigan where posted speed limits vary from 70 to 75 mph and the flow of traffic generally exceeds them by a value of 10 to 20 percent or more. Once the size of the approaching vehicles in your rearview mirror begins to stabilize, however, maintaining the pace is easy. Set the cruise at 70, 80, or even 90 mph if you wish, and the Equinox is a willing accessory in your challenge to test the skills of the local constabulary. Interior noise at a steady 70 mph is a hushed 68 decibels, two quieter than the 1.5T and not too shabby for a vehicle with a compression-ignition engine. While we doubt acceleration test numbers play into the decision-making process of most prospective Equinox diesel buyers, it is worth noting that the Equinox with the turbocharged 2.0-liter and all-wheel drive knocked off the zero-to-60-mph measure in 6.6 seconds and completed the quarter in 15.1 seconds at 94 mph; that's 2.8 and 2.1 seconds quicker, a vast gulf of a performance difference. On the other hand, the turbocharged 1.5-liter with AWD barely ekes out a win over the diesel, posting times of 8.9 and 16.9 seconds at 83 mph, which fall within half a second of the diesel. Meanwhile, the Honda CR-V, one of our top picks in the segment, posted 7.6- and 16.0-second times. The difference with the diesel is that you are using all of the accelerator travel most of the time, whereas the gasoline engine can be operated with a bit more finesse. That the Equinox's diesel four-cylinder takes these frequent full-throttle assaults so eagerly and stoically is its saving grace. Braking numbers are similarly underwhelming. With a 182-foot stop from 70 mph, the diesel Equinox takes a full 15 feet longer than the 2.0-liter Equinox's 167 feet and 21 feet more than the pretty impressive 161-foot braking distance posted by the 1.5-liter Equinox. Repeated stops revealed a firm, fade-free pedal at least, and the newly refined suspension keeps the 3769-pound car from nosediving or heading for the ditch. It's that same suspension tuning that enables the diesel Equinox to negotiate broken pavement without sending shock waves through the cabin yet still remain reasonably level during mildly aggressive directional changes as well as on long, sweeping freeway ramps. The compromise is effective and, combined with direct steering response, results in a vehicle more entertaining to drive than its middling 0.77 g of lateral grip would indicate. Indeed, the 0.85- and 0.86-g lateral-acceleration marks posted by the Equinox's 2.0- and 1.5-liter gasoline brethren suggest the untapped potential of the chassis. In cases like this, where similar vehicles post disparate braking and grip numbers, tire selection usually is the culprit. Our diesel Equinox wore 225/65R-17 Bridgestone Dueler H/L 422 all-seasons, while the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter models were shod with 235/50R-19 Hankook Ventus S1 Noble2 all-season rubber. Upgrading to 19-inch wheels and tires on the diesel will cost you $1995, although we'd think twice before doing so as we definitely preferred the diesel's much more forgiving ride quality on the 17s. Numbers Game As is the case for most non-pickup-truck buyers, the decision of whether to go diesel ultimately comes down to dollars and cents. Chevy does a nice job of minimizing the guesswork by limiting the diesel model to the top two trims. Wearing a base price of $33,385, our 3LT AWD model included remote start, cloth seating, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, and aluminum wheels. The sole option was the literally named Sun & Infotainment package, which adds a sunroof, a power liftgate, an 8.0-inch touchscreen to replace the base 7.0-inch unit, a driver info display, a 120-volt AC power outlet, and two additional USB charging ports. Far from opulent, this $2245 package bundles the features most buyers require. All in, our Equinox diesel carried a $35,630 as-tested price. (Front-wheel-drive diesels start at $31,635; going diesel is a $3890 upcharge over a 1.5T and $1345 more than a 2.0T.) But for serious dieselheads, purchase price is only the second or third most important number. It's fuel efficiency that impresses this thrifty bunch, the allure of extracting every possible mile from each gallon of dino juice far outweighing the ante. In that metric it delivers in spades. EPA rated at an already impressive 38 mpg on the highway, our Equinox returned a solid 43 mpg in our 75-mph highway cruise test. That's a full 15 mpg better than the 1.5-liter Equinox AWD posted in the same test. Combined with its 15.6-gallon fuel capacity, the only thing standing between you and 670 miles of highway travel is a catheter. (Curiously, front-wheel-drive models get a slightly smaller 14.9-gallon fuel tank.) In addition, our observed 34-mpg combined figure not only beats the EPA's estimate by 2 mpg but also puts a 13-mpg smackdown on the 1.5-liter Equinox's observed 21 mpg. The 2.0-liter Equinox fared no better, managing just 22 mpg in our hands. At this point, convention dictates that we point out that the cost of diesel fuel traditionally is 10 to 20 percent above that of bottom-shelf regular. But that argument is somewhat negated in this instance by the Equinox diesel's dramatically superior fuel economy and the fact that the 2.0-liter model requires pricey premium fuel. Still, there are a lot of variables involved, and only you can determine if diesel Equinox ownership will ultimately pencil in your favor. Then again, if you're in the market for an appealing compact crossover and the thought of using the least amount of fuel as possible for every mile traveled gives you a thrill, the Equinox diesel is currently your best bet. In fact, the only thing that could screw up the Equinox's lock on this subsegment is the arrival of the long-promised Mazda CX-5 diesel.

AAADukn	lifestyle	shop-all	Silver Hair Is Trending! Here's How to Get the Grey Look at Home	We're giving "going grey" a whole new meaning.	We're giving "going grey" a whole new meaning. Hair color used to be the go-to for covering grey hair, but now we're happy to report that it can also be used to embrace it. Whether you're naturally grey and ready to rock it, or you're looking to follow the latest trend, we've got the hair dye to give you the color you crave: that's right, silver! Even better, we chatted with celebrity colorist Rachel Bodt to get her take on the best way to tackle grey hair color at home: Q: Do you think grey hair is trending right now? A: Yes. I think there are so many variations of this too, from more of a white silver to a stone grey. It's becoming more of a staple. Q: Do you have any tips for women who want to transition to wearing their natural grey color? A: The transition can be a challenge, but I always tell my clients to be patient and know it will be worth it. There are a few ways you can do it, but it's usually a combination of highlights and lowlights to break the strong line. There's also a trick where you can change the part and color on the new part, when enough of the natural grey comes in, change the part back to the original. Q: Are there any products you recommend for keeping grey/silver hair looking bright? A: I love Kristen Ess' purple shampoo and conditioner . If you want it even more silver or grey, I love making color conditioners with a white mask and adding a drop of black (Adore) to it! I also love ACV [apple cider vinegar] rinses . They remove buildup and residue so the color looks more vibrant. Pollution and mineral deposits can dull grey hair, so this truly helps. Q: Any other advice or tips relating to grey and silver hair color? A: The more you shampoo it, the more it will lighten, so I also recommend doing a co-wash to clean, but not strip your hair. Also, doing Olaplex treatments once a week to keep the bonds strong. The stronger the bonds are, the less the color will fade. Ready to go grey yet?

BBGLGrn	autos	autosluxury	2017 Lincoln Continental Black Label Interior Review	What's the inside of an $80,000 Lincoln sedan like?	Some consumers' only experience with Lincoln is from the back seat of a chauffeur-driven airport shuttle, but the brand has been on a multiyear effort to change that. The MKS-replacing 2017 Lincoln Continental sedan is part of the plan to shift perception amongst those who might actually give a different luxury brand a change. To get their attention, Lincoln offers the Continental with three engines and a number of upscale options, and on the high-end Black Label trim, three available interior color schemes. We spent some quality time with a 400-hp, all-wheel-drive Continental to see how much of its $79,780 as-tested price tag is earned on the inside. Feels Good Generally, the materials quality inside our near-$80,000 Continental tester was very good. The Black Label model, which also includes free car washes, an annual detail, and four years or 50,000 miles of complimentary maintenance, features an Alcantara headliner and Venetian leather with perforations that make the seats look like they have a repeating Lincoln star pattern. There's also a leather or leatherlike pad on the side of the center console where your knee might rest. Even if the material itself could be softer, it looks and feels better than the alternative, which is just a hard black panel in other cars. Move it Up! Where the Continental loses some of its premium appeal is its central screen. The screen is only 8.0 inches, which would be adequate in an MKZ or compact luxury crossover but not so much on an $80,000 car. The screen wouldn't look as small if it were tilted back for better visibility, filled out more of the center stack between the buttons on either side or, better yet, were pushed to the very top of the dash. Some won't take any issue with the Continental's screen size or placement, but spend some time inside the Genesis G90 or a higher-trim Lexus or BMW sedan, and you'll see what a difference a bigger screen or a better placement can make. Digitally Stylish, But... The Continental features a completely digital instrument cluster, a great option that makes the car feel more contemporary. Its gold accent color reminded Motor Trend en Espa ol editor Miguel Cortina of midcentury modern design. The clean, serifless font is cool, too. Although the display is appreciated, I wish it would fill out more of the entire instrument cluster area instead of leaving a decent amount of surrounding black plastic. Shall I Meet You at the Chalet? If you're willing to spend $80,000 on a brand that's not as well-respected as the usual names, the Black Label trim's appeal centers on the three interior color themes. Our tester was outfitted in the Chalet style, which comes with Alpine and Espresso leather. I don't normally like leather in such a light shade of beige, but I absolutely loved the two-tone steering wheel. It's a great detail, though another editor and I were really intrigued by the Rhapsody Blue theme that's also available. The third option on Continental Black Labels is the Thoroughbred theme, which combines saddle- and black-colored accents. None of these color schemes will fix the size or placement of that center-stack screen, but having those interior color options adds to the Continental's luxury credentials. Ahhhh But What's That Noise? The Continental also makes available a pair of 30-way power seats with a massaging function for $1,500. Having the ability to customize the seats so much is fantastic, as is the fact that the massage, heating, and ventilating functions have one-touch controls surprisingly, that's not the case for every car in this class. What would make this feature more of a value is if the massagers were quieter. On a near-$80,000 diesel-powered Ford F-250 King Ranch truck , you might not be able to hear the buzzing of a massaging seat, but it's far more obvious on a luxury sedan. What caused us a little concern about the 30-way seats is the fact that more than one editor noticed that the ones on our tester creaked a little. It's unclear if this issue is unique to our test car. Where'd You Hide My Handles? The Continental's exterior design has divided our staff. Where some see " anonymous styling ," others find the exterior design especially with the Black Label's 20-inch wheels striking. It's not often you can say your car offers a feature that is truly unique, but the Continental hides all four of its door handles on the bottom of the side window's chrome trim. It's a neat detail that, from the inside, requires you to hit a button before pushing the door open instead of pulling a door handle. Dip your fingers into the depressed area on the door that helps you close the door, and you'll feel a high-quality, out-of-sight soft material. Push It As with other Lincolns, the Continental lacks a traditional gear selector stalk. Instead, after you press the start button, you'll find buttons to the left of the center-stack screen to engage park, reverse, neutral, drive, or a sport mode. This system won't be for everyone, and not having a gear stalk means you don't have something to wrap your right hand around when you're at a long red light or waiting in a loading zone. The advantage of shifting the transmission controls to the center stack is increasing storage space in the center console, including a deep spot at the base of the center stack where you can charge your phone. One other helpful detail is that the HVAC and some audio controls are located on a slanted plane that feels more natural than having to tilt your hand to reach a knob or button on a nearly vertical plane, as in many other cars. If You Press Them, Nothing Will Happen The Lincoln Continental is offered with a great variety of options, and that's a good thing. One industry-wide problem pops up sometimes when you don't have a loaded version of a car that allows so much room for options-customization. In the Lincoln's case, if you have a Continental without the 360-degree camera system or the "look what I can do" semi-automatic parking system, two buttons on the right side of the central screen go blank (our tester with the Technology package had those options), serving as a regular reminder that your car isn't completely loaded. Spread Out The Continental's rear seat is reasonably spacious, especially if you're more accustomed to the cabin of the smaller MKZ sedan. Our Black Label model was equipped with a $4,300 executive rear-seat package that adds heated and ventilated seats, controls for the rear sunshade, four-way power lumbar, and massaging seats that can recline, too. There's also a giant center armrest with controls, limited audio controls, a small info screen, two USBs, and cupholders. One editor found that the cupholders felt cheap, and we wish the two rear USBs were located in a more convenient spot in the center armrest instead of below the central rear air vents. So? How you perceive the interior of a nearly $80,000 Lincoln depends on what brand loyalties you currently have. If you've been inside MKS or MKZ sedans recently but want something richer, the Continental will impress. Lincoln is carving out its own style niche among luxury cars, and we like what we see in the loaded Black Label car. If Lincoln can perfect more of the details, the Continental can be even more of a threat. As it is, a $79,780 Continental Black Label feels special and different, and it comes close to living up to its price tag.

Other exterior updates include standard 17-inch wheels on SLE and SLT1 trims while 18-inch wheels are standard on the SLT2. Eighteen-inch wheels are optional on SLE2 and SLT1 models. Inside, Siri Eyes Free and text message support offer safer smartphone integration.	Vehicle Overview While mechanically similar to the Chevrolet Equinox, the GMC Terrain offers more upscale, boxier sheetmetal. Two engines are offered on the Terrain: a 182-hp 2.4-liter I-4 with 172 lb-ft of torque and a 301-hp, 272 lb-ft 3.6-liter V-6 mated - both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic and are available in front- or all-wheel drive. The 2.4-liter is EPA-rated 20-22/29-32 mpg city/highway depending on the number of drive wheels, while V-6 models are rated 16-17/23-24 mpg. For those who want more, the Terrain Denali steps up the two-row crossover's luxury quotient. We weren't impressed with the discontinued 264-hp 3.0-liter V-6 in our 2012 Terrain First Test, saying "It'll get out of its own way, but don't expect brisk acceleration." Last year, the 3.0-liter was replaced by a more powerful yet no less efficient 3.6-liter V-6. After a quick comparison test between the 2013 GMC Terrain Denali 3.6 and 2012 Kia Sorento SX, we said: "Based on a mere four hours spent comparing the GMC and Kia, we're not in a position to call a definite winner, but we horsepower junkies are fully prepared to praise GMC's decision to offer more power at no cost to fuel efficiency." With the arrival of the more powerful 3.6-liter in 2013, there are few changes for the 2014 Terrain. SLE and SLT1 models now feature standard 17-inch wheels and 18-inch wheels are standard on SLT2 and available on SLE2 and SLT1 trims. New Siri Eyes Free and text message support offer safer smartphone integration. Silver Sky Metallic is a new exterior paint color. The 2014 GMC Terrain crossover has a four-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars) and is considered a Top Safety Pick by the IIHS for cars built after November 2012. New for 2014 Silver Sky Metallic joins the paint palette for 2014. Other exterior updates include standard 17-inch wheels on SLE and SLT1 trims while 18-inch wheels are standard on the SLT2.

We finally racked up enough miles on our Infiniti JX35 to trigger the maintenance minder for its second oil change, oil filter, and tire rotation. Originally this notice popped up on the infotainment screen at 11,250 miles, but after careful examination of the service schedule, we decided to adjust the service intervals from Schedule 1 (more severe driving conditions) to Schedule 2 (less severe). This sets the maintenance intervals at 7500 miles instead of the system's default of 3750. Driving up to the Central Coast for a weekend-long camping trip, the JX averaged 19.2 mpg. While the JX was in for its oil service, I also had the power back hatch repaired. Previously, the power back door would open, but would then start closing again as soon as it reached the top of the door strut travel. This caught a few of us off guard, as we would begin loading the cargo area. Infiniti South Bay adjusted the left-side clearance sensor, and the power door now functions normally.

AAsurj6	autos	autosnews	2018 Jaguar XE: What You Need to Know	Thanks to its athletic handling and robust engine choices, the 2018 Jaguar XE has great overall performance. However, with a below-average predicted reliability rating and mixed reviews for its back seat, trunk, and infotainment technology, it sits near the bottom of our luxury small car rankings.	Thanks to its athletic handling and robust engine choices, the 2018 Jaguar XE has great overall performance. However, with a below-average predicted reliability rating and mixed reviews for its back seat, trunk, and infotainment technology, it sits near the bottom of our luxury small car rankings. Is the Jaguar XE a Good Car? The 2018 Jaguar XE is a decent luxury small car that delivers on engaging driving dynamics and robust engine power. However, the Jaguar's interior drags down its overall appeal. A cramped rear seat and so-so cabin styling will likely turn off some shoppers. The XE also has one of the worst predicted reliability ratings in the class. Should I Buy the Jaguar XE? If you're willing to look past its below-average predicted reliability, the athletic Jaguar XE is a good choice. It stands out from the sea of performance-focused German competitors. Sharp handling, a balanced suspension, and a lineup of enthusiastic engines put the XE among a small group of refined yet athletic small cars. There isn't much room for back-seat passengers, though. Also, some find the XE's infotainment system frustrating to use. Those aren't concerns in higher-ranking rivals like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4 . Should I Buy a New or Used Jaguar XE? The Jaguar XE was introduced as an all-new model for 2017, yet it sees some significant changes for 2018. Under the hood, the standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine is now rated at 247 horsepower, up from 240 in the 2017 model. Jaguar also debuts an optional 296-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder, while the optional supercharged V6 gets a boost to 380 horsepower (it had 340 in the 2017 EX). Jaguar also introduced new driver assistance features, including Forward Vehicle Guidance and Forward Traffic Detection. If you can live without these updates, and you're open to driving a used car, consider shopping for a 2017 Jaguar XE to save some money.

To keep our recommendations unbiased, we decline expensive gifts from carmakers, and a third party handles our advertising. How Much Does the Jaguar XE Cost? The starting price of the Jaguar XE is about average for the luxury small car class, at $35,725. At the upper end of the XE spectrum is the range-topping XE Portfolio, which starts at $56,500. Other trims available for 2018 include the XE Premium ($38,325), XE R-Sport ($45,825), and XE S ($52,275). For great savings at your local Jaguar dealer, check out our U.S. News Best Price Program . Jaguar XE Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Jaguar XE or BMW 3 Series? On the performance front, both the Jaguar XE and BMW 3 Series fare well in our rankings. You'll find a powerful lineup of engines and nimble handling in each model. Inside, however, the BMW offers more space and an intuitive infotainment system. Additionally, it's available in Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo hatchback versions for increased utility, and it has a higher predicted reliability rating. The 3 Series is a better value and a better choice. Which Is Better: Jaguar XE or Audi A4? Though both cars earn praise in the performance department, the Audi A4' s interior outshines the Jaguar XE's in almost every way. The A4 comes with more standard features than the XE   including smartphone integration via Android Auto and Apple CarPlay   and Audi's MMI infotainment system is easy to use. The A4 also has enough back-seat space for adults to ride comfortably. The Audi is the better choice. Which Is Better: Jaguar XE or Mercedes-Benz C-Class? In this segment, it's hard to beat the Mercedes-Benz C-Class ' interior elegance. Mercedes materials are first-class, and the styling oozes opulence. The C-Class also comes with lots of standard high-tech safety features, like a driver drowsiness monitor and collision prevention assist. Unless you're sold on the XE's athleticism, go with the C-Class. Keep in mind, however, that both vehicles have low predicted reliability ratings. XE Interior How Many People Does the XE Seat? Of the XE's five seats, the driver and front passenger have the best in the house. The cushions are comfy and supportive, with upgrades like sport seats, heat, and ventilation to enhance your ride. The touch screen and other buttons are easy to reach. There isn't much legroom for rear-seat passengers, though two adults can fit in the back for a short outing. XE and Car Seats In the back seat, the XE has lower anchors and a tether anchor mounted at each outboard seat. XE Interior Quality The XE has a solid build quality and a quiet ride. That said, some might question the styling and choice of materials. The somewhat subdued design doesn't create an aura of opulence, as you'll find in a Mercedes-Benz C-Class . Nor do upgraded materials like grained leather seats, carbon fiber inlays, and burl ash trim match the first-class level of Mercedes and Audi . XE Cargo Space The XE's 15.9-cubic-foot trunk seems impressive, topping the cargo space of rivals like the BMW 3 Series . In practice, however, its narrow shape is limiting, giving you only enough space for about four medium-sized rolling suitcases. XE Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation Reviews on Jaguar's InControl Touch infotainment interface are divided. For some, the InControl system has a sleek look and feel about it, especially when outfitted with the available 10-inch touch screen. Others report quirks that include freezing up and slow responses to inputs, noting that these issues are especially noticeable when using the available navigation system. For infotainment systems with such a wide range of assessments, it's best to try it out for yourself to see if you can live with it on a daily basis. We also recommend the upgraded InControl Touch Pro interface, which improves user experience by linking to a variety of smartphone apps. XE Performance XE Engine: Plenty of Power All-Around You have your pick of four available engines with the 2018 XE, and all are good. The standard turbocharged four-cylinder is eager to launch. This engine   like the others in the lineup   comes with a refined eight-speed automatic transmission. If you're on a mission for faster takeoffs, a higher horsepower four-cylinder is available. Jaguar also offers a potent (and satisfyingly growly) supercharged V6 that can reach 60 mph from a standstill in as little as 4.9 seconds. XE Gas Mileage: Fuel-Sipping Turbodiesel If you want a luxury small car with low fuel costs, pick the XE's available turbodiesel engine. It gets 32 mpg in the city and 42 mpg on the highway, which is far higher than the class average. Though the gas mileage with the base four-cylinder engine is lower, it's still thriftier than most. Fuel economy ratings for this engine are 25 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway. XE Ride and Handling: Fun to Drive Handling is a high point for the XE. Its steering is precise, and the suspension is stiff enough to limit body roll yet soft enough to absorb bumps with grace. Every XE comes with paddle shifters on the steering wheel and torque vectoring (which adds stability when cornering). You can adjust elements like steering and throttle response through the drive mode selector, which includes Normal, Eco, Dynamic, and Rain/Ice/Snow settings. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. XE Reliability Is the Jaguar XE Reliable? The 2018 Jaguar XE has a predicted reliability rating of two out of five from J.D. Power. That's the lowest score a car can receive. Both the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4 have higher ratings. Jaguar XE Warranty The XE has a five-year/60,000-mile warranty, which is longer than the coverage for an Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series . XE Safety XE Crash Test Results Like many luxury vehicles, the XE doesn't undergo crash testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. XE Safety Features The XE comes standard with rain-sensing windshield wipers and an adaptive speed limiter, the latter of which can be set manually or can use information from the navigation system or traffic sign recognition system (both optional) to prevent you from speeding. Jaguar also offers a rearview camera, a surround-view camera system, emergency braking, lane departure warning, active lane keep assist, a driver condition monitor, active park assist for both parallel and perpendicular parking, blind spot monitoring with active blind spot assist, rear cross traffic monitoring, front and rear parking sensors, a head-up display, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality. Which Jaguar XE Model Is Right for Me? Jaguar suggests that the best way to narrow your XE search is to start by picking your engine. For 2018, there are four available engines, all of which come with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The main engine is a turbocharged four-cylinder, available in 247-horsepower and 296-horsepower versions. A turbodiesel engine can be added to most trim levels, while only the XE S comes with a supercharged V6. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. Once you've settled on an engine, select the trim outfitted with the amenities you want. Available trim levels include XE, Premium, Prestige, R-Sport, S, and Portfolio (see below for more details on each trim). For the best value, we recommend the entry-level XE. It comes with a nice arrangement of standard features, and you can add options like a $410 rearview camera or a $1,020 Cold Climate package for less money than upgrading to the Premium trim level. Jaguar XE The Jaguar XE comes standard with synthetic leather seats, 10-way power-adjustable front seats, an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system, HD Radio, a USB port, Bluetooth, a six-speaker audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, push-button start, and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Jaguar XE prices start at $35,725. Jaguar XE Premium Added features of the XE Premium ($38,325) include a rearview camera, an 11-speaker Meridian sound system, a memory function for the driver's settings, and auto-dimming power-fold exterior mirrors. Jaguar XE Prestige The XE Prestige ($42,225) adds grained leather seats, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, keyless entry, navigation, front power lumbar support, and interior mood lighting. Sport Editions Jaguar lists three models that lean toward the sportier side, all of which include most Prestige trim features. The R-Sport ($45,825) comes with sport seats and uses unique styling elements to brandish its sportier side. The XE S ($52,275), the most powerful trim in the lineup, comes with a 380-horsepower supercharged V6 engine. The range-topping XE Portfolio ($56,500) has a more powerful version of the base four-cylinder engine   tuned to 296 horsepower   and a rich array of tech and safety features. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Jaguar dealer. The Final Call The Jaguar XE is a good pick for those who enjoy driving, want an extra boost for their commute, and will rarely have rear-seat passengers. Its performance is on par with sports sedans like the Cadillac ATS , BMW 3 Series , and Audi A4 . As a relatively new addition to the class, the XE is also a good option for those who want something a little less commonplace parked in their driveway. However, if you want to stand out with sharp exterior styling or an overly posh interior, you're out of luck; the XE doesn't quite hang with some of its German counterparts. And not only does the XE have one of the lowest predicted reliability ratings in the class, but it also comes up short on back-seat and trunk space. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis. Read the full 2018 Jaguar XE review on U.S. News & World Report for more details, photos, specs and prices.
AAth6aY	autos	autosenthusiasts	Thousand of Corvettes come together for America's biggest 'Vette show	Now in its second year as a four-day event, the 2017 edition of the Corvettes at Carlisle show was another home run for the organizers.	Now in its second year as a four-day event, the 2017 edition of the Corvettes at Carlisle show was another home run for the organizers. Aided by exceptionally tame weather for August, the show drew over 5,000 Corvettes and 60,000 fans from across the globe to the largest Corvette-themed event. Keeping all those fans entertained can sometimes be a difficult task so every year the Carlisle Events staff works on a key display where some specific milestone in the Corvette world is celebrated. For 2017, the '67 L88 Corvette took center stage. With only 20 examples produced in 1967, and 16 known to exist, half of those were on display during the weekend. There was even a fully functional L88 engine display to show just how special these cars are. This year Carlisle also hosted Callaway's 30-year reunion of the (RPO) B2K Callaway Twin Turbo Corvette. Introduced in 1987, this was the first and only time that Chevrolet had a factory orderable non-GM Performance option on a Corvette. As you can guess, there were some examples in the Callaway display. The 25th anniversary of the Callaway Speedster was showcased as well, with some examples at the show. Also set up with a strong presence was the National Corvette Restorers Society (NCRS), with their tent housing a number of Corvette generations that have gone through the certification process. Some NCRS level cars could also be found in the invitational display exclusively set up for the 1967 Corvette. This was a great mix of Vettes that ranged from survivors to full blown restorations. This year, a pair of well-worn C1 Corvettes showed up and stole the show. Their popularity rivaled that of the multi-million dollar L88s as fan favorites. Beyond some of the high-end displays, there was also the swap meet area that was lined with vendors selling restoration and aftermarket parts, and a vast amount of used Corvette parts and cars. For those hunting parts, it is a safe bet that if you can't find it in the swap meet area at Carlisle, chances are you aren't going to find it. From mechanical and body parts to automobilia there were plenty of folks selling their items throughout the swap meet area. Project cars could also be found. But if you were looking for a turnkey ride, then the car corral was the place to look. This year, as in previous years, there was a wide selection of cars to choose from that appealed to the varied tastes of the attendees looking for a car. From NCRS certified to Pro Street and restomod it was all well represented. For those that didn't want to drive away with their purchase, and prefer to get their hands dirty, numerous project cars in varying degrees of completeness could be found. The other aspect that makes buying a car at Carlisle a painless process is that the folks that run the show offer title and registration services on the premises, along with financing through a third party. Another show favorite is the burnout contest. Corvette demographics don't show the average owner beating on their cars, so the burnout candidate counts are usually low at the show. This year there were three: Ella Miller the daughter of the co-owner of Carlisle events Lance Miller usually does one with her Corvette-bodied go-kart, and two other individuals took up the challenge. The owner of the silver C5 was repeat participant. His car nearly burnt to the ground last year during the burnout attempt. And then there is the bikini contest. Like it or not it's a Carlisle tradition, and as expected, it continues to be a favorite that rivals any of the Corvette happenings throughout the weekend. This year there were only five entries for the contest. With such a large gathering of the Corvette faithful in one spot, the show is a golden opportunity for companies like Chevrolet to display their cars and also inform prospective buyers of what they have coming down the line. They had a sizeable presence this year with a full product display. Beyond the GM display, the Manufacturer's Midway was also lined with aftermarket vendors selling everything from complete frames to engines and restoration parts. The largest was show sponsor Corvette America, with their extensive line of licensed Corvette reproduction parts for every Corvette generation. It's still early to find out what displays will be at the show for 2018, but we suspect that it will be tied in with some significant Corvette produced in 1968. The bikini contest and the burnout contest will also be on the list, and we know that it will take place on Aug 23-26, 2018. Follow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter
AAuJwxQ	news	causes-homelessness	Former homeless mom, featured in 2000 article: 'My life is wonderful now'	The old Beacon-News story, tucked away in a shoebox, recalls a time in Estrellita Velazquez's life most people would want to keep stored far away.	The old Beacon-News story, tucked away in a shoebox, recalls a time in Estrellita Velazquez's life most people would want to keep stored far away. But the 59-year-old former Aurora, Ill., woman does not want that memory to fade like the newspaper print itself. Now living in Athens, Ga., she gets the crinkled, yellowed page out every now and then, despite the tears it brings to her and husband Raul's eyes, as a reminder of how far she and her family have come since Dec. 12, 2000, when the story was published. Velazquez isn't sure why this last time she so carefully unfolded it that she felt compelled to contact the newspaper   to say thank you for this intimate portrait of a family's struggle that she claims "saved my life." The article, titled "Sunshine and Shadow," was written by former reporter Benjie Hughes. And one of the photographs, shot by then-staffer Callie Lipkin, featured Velazquez and husband, Raul Galdamez, with piles of their possessions next to the van the family had temporarily been living in. The story was about their path to homelessness   most of which was the result of Velazquez's cocaine addiction that led to a bitter custody battle with her own mother over her young children. The parents won the court case, and Velazquez says she and her mother, Mary, made peace with each other before the elder woman died of ovarian cancer in 2005. "I do believe she just wanted to help," she told me in a phone interview from Georgia. "What my mother did was wrong, but I forgave her. And what I did was wrong too, but she forgave me." Still, cocaine is a nasty foe, and Velazquez admits she did not completely kick her drug habit until years later. But seeing her story in print, she told me, is what began her road to sobriety. "It brought out something in me ... It woke me up." And had it not been for this very public spotlight, "I probably would be dead right now ... killed or overdosed like most of my friends who did drugs with me and are now gone." The story focused on the parent's red-tape custody case, a cause championed by Diane Nilan, who was then executive director of Hesed House, where Velazquez and her family stayed for over a year. But it was mostly a story about a mother's love. Velazquez maintains she "was always a good mom" who never used drugs around her children. But she also struggled with mental health issues, which in turn led to the use of drugs. Still, it was not until 2010 when the family moved to Georgia that Velazquez said she could finally claim to be drug free. And she wanted us to know that in these past eight years, "we are all doing just fine." "If I had known then what I know now, I would have never touched the stuff," she says of her cocaine habit. "I wasted a lot of years." Velazquez credits her eventual success against drugs to her husband, who she describes as "a great man." Raul was working for a Naperville, Ill., business at the time, she told me, and asked for a transfer to Georgia, so his wife could leave behind the old triggers of her addiction. It was a good move. The family now owns their home, she said, where Armando, who was only 7 when they were homeless; Dianna, then 6, and Angellita, who was 4, are living while working full-time jobs and/or taking classes. Elena, who was then 11, is living on her own with her young daughter and working as a plasma technician. The "Sunshine and Shadow" feature was not the first time Velazquez and her family had been in the paper. A month earlier, a photo of Raul comforting his wife at Hesed House after the children were taken by the state was published with a story about the 15th anniversary of the homeless shelter. And a file photo of the family was again used five years later to accompany a feature about Nilan after she'd written a book, "Crossing the Line: Taking Steps to Understand and End Homelessness." Nilan, now executive director of Hear Us, a Naperville-based nonprofit that brings awareness to issues of children and homelessness, easily recalled this struggling but close-knit family. And she was delighted, but not especially surprised they have continued to not only survive but thrive. "(Estrellita) was always just so grateful for all the little things," she recalled. "Even though she had an uphill climb on such a slippery slope, she just still managed to find a way to keep trying. She had something very special." That included being "so connected in such a loving way to her family," Nilan added, "in a way that was beyond the norm." Velazquez insists that despite the ugly custody battle   at one point, she was arrested for violating an order of protection when she went to see her kids, she said   she never stopped caring deeply for her mom. After Mary died, Velazquez says she "could smell her presence in their home." But since moving to Georgia, that sensory reminder is gone ... which is just fine. "She knows I am doing good now," says Velazquez. "The kids are doing beautifully. She has let go." Now dealing with diabetes, high blood pressure and a herniated disc, Velezquez says she "thinks a lot about the future now" and wants her story to be a reminder to people who are struggling with physical, emotional or financial issues that "no matter how bad things can get in life to never give up hope." "My life is wonderful now ... I have so much to be grateful for. So much to be happy about." All of which, Nilan tells me, is why this woman is so unforgettable. "It strikes me that the people who have the least are the ones who really have the most," she said. "Estrellita's ability to overcome what she was dealt will always be an inspiration."

To the next chapter. Many celebrity splits have rocked Hollywood   including Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux and exes Chris Pratt and Anna Faris. Look back at some of the most shocking breakups through the years. John Cena and Nikki Bella Cena and Bella called off their one-year engagement on April 15, 2018. The Blockers actor popped the question during Wrestlemania 33 in 2017. "I have been waiting so long to ask you this. Stephanie Nicole Garcia-Colace, will you marry me?" he asked at the time. They'd later confirm their split in an exclusive joint statement to Us Weekly. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan The pair announced in April 2018 that they were separating after nearly nine years of marriage. They tied the knot in 2009 three years after meeting on set of Step Up and welcomed daughter Everly in 2013. "Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision   just two best friends realizing it's time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible," they said in a joint statement to Us Weekly. "We are still a family and will always be loving, dedicated parents to Everly." Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston The actors announced in February 2018 that they were separating after two years of marriage   and seven years together overall. "In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year," the pair told Us Weekly in a joint statement. "We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship." Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie The exes made headlines when the actress filed for divorce after two years of marriage in September 2016 citing irreconcilable differences. In February 2018, the pair were reportedly still working out their divorce settlement. They are parents of six children   Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne. Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert The country superstars announced their split after four years of marriage in July 2015. "This is not the future we envisioned," their representatives told Us Weekly in a statement at the time. "And it is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately. We are real people, with real lives, with real families, friends and colleagues. Therefore, we kindly ask for privacy and compassion concerning this very personal matter." Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale Us Weekly exclusively revealed in November 2015 that Rossdale cheated on Stefani with their family nanny, three months after the pair confirmed their split. "While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment," the stars told Us in a statement at the time. The exes were married for 13 years and are parents of three sons   Kingston, Zuma and Apollo. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin It's over. The Oscar winner and Coldplay frontman announced in March 2014 that they were going their separate ways after more than a decade of marriage. "It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate," they said in a joint statement. "We have been working hard for well over a year, some of it together, some of it separated, to see what might have been possible between us, and we have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much, we will remain separate." The exes   who are parents of daughter Apple and son Moses   finalized their divorce in July 2016. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes Moving on. Holmes and Cruise announced that they were divorcing after five years of marriage in June 2012. "Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest. This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family," Holmes' attorney Jonathan Wolfe said in a statement to Us at the time. The pair welcomed Suri in April 2006. Chris Pratt and Anna Faris The couple announced in August 2017 that they were legally separating after eight years of marriage. "We tried really hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep the situation as private as possible moving forward. We still love each other and will always cherish our time together," they said in a joint statement. The parents of Jack both filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences that December.

These expert-approved tips will keep you calm, happy, and focused. 45 Things Doctors Want You to Know About Mental Health For some people, it's the everyday stresses of life that get them down. For others, it's an unexplained chemical imbalance in their brain that leads to depression, anxiety, and an overall feeling of hopelessness and helplessness. Just because it's an invisible disease doesn't mean it isn't serious; an estimated 1 in 20 people over the age of 12 in the US have depression , according to the CDC. But the good news is that a bad state of mind doesn't have to be permanent. Through a combination of lifestyle changes, seeking professional help, and taking medication, you can achieve better mental health. We tapped medical doctors, psychologists, and other health professionals for their top tips on achieving a better state of mind. Although everyone experiences mental illness differently and it's always advised to seek the help of a medical professional, these 45 tips are a good place to start. Then, make sure you avoid the 15 Foods That Make Your Depression or Anxiety Worse . 1. Don't Be Ashamed "Don't be ashamed about it. Almost every family is touched by mental illness in a family member. There is no need for mental illness to remain in the shadows. Mental illness is just like any other illness. It is diagnosed by specific criteria, it responds to appropriate treatment and it is universally recognized throughout the healthcare field."   Christopher Hollingsworth, MD 2. See a Therapist If You Need To "Therapists are very valuable for helping to change one's way of thinking through cognitive behavioral therapy. It need not be long term. Sometimes a short course can help one reorient one's thoughts."   Gary J. Kerkvliet, MD 3. Or Seek Another Kind of Professional Help "Seek and be consistent with professional help. No excuses. With services such as DoctorOnDemand.com, there is no reason why you cannot confidentially, safely, comfortably and affordably see a professional to help you."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 4. Find a Doctor You Like "If your doctor makes you feel rushed or answers questions using too much medical terminology or just makes you feel uncomfortable, try to find another doctor. On the other hand, you have a responsibility to be prepared for your appointments. Bring a list of questions, bring your list of medications, know your health history   maybe bring an index card that summarizes your history if it is complicated. Consider bringing a trusted friend or family member with you to offer support and take notes."   Lisa Doggett, MD 5. Don't Isolate Yourself "Remaining isolated during times of stress or depression is highly likely to increase whatever uncomfortable feelings and symptoms you are experiencing. Social interaction helps with normalizing feelings and the human experience, it communicates that we are not alone and provides us with an opportunity to express negative emotions and feelings."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 6. Try New Experiences "Seek out experiences that are positive and make you happy. Why push yourself to experience negative situations and people?"   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 7. Stay Stimulated "For all mental health, keep the brain stimulated every day"   Gary J. Kerkvliet, MD, internist, primary care physician 8. Get Outside Dr. Kerkvliet also recommends getting out of bed and going outside. It may be hard to do, especially if you're depressed, but even a little sunshine and vitamin D can improve your mood. 9. Lace Up Your Walking Shoes "Simply walking 20-25 minutes a day at a moderate pace can reduce anxiety and depression by over 40 percent"   David Sabgir, MD, FACC 10. Experience Nature "There's a great new book out by Florence Williams, Nature Fix. The benefits of being in nature and its effect on mental health are powerful."   David Sabgir, MD, FACC 11. Get Help as Soon as You Experience Symptoms "Getting help early from a professional you trust, being honest about your condition with yourself and seeking support from close family and/or friends is key. Keeping your appointments with counselors and doctors involved in your care and following their treatment recommendations (especially taking any medications you are prescribed) will greatly increase your odds of getting better and staying healthy."   Lisa Doggett, MD 12. Find a Coping Mechanism That Works "Have multiple coping mechanisms. We are all going to feel stress and possibly depression as we walk through the journey of life. Dealing with mental illness is how you cope with the stress that will come upon us."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 13. Write Down Your Negative Self-Talk "I would recommend you write down the exact thoughts you are having (literally, what are you saying to yourself in your head). This will help you objectively see the content of your thoughts so you can read them and "reframe" them; meaning, dispute the thoughts. Reframing will help you find more positive alternatives."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 14. Have a Good Work-Life Balance "Seek out balance in your life. Work, family, recreation, hobbies, relationship, friendships, physical health, spirituality, nutrition and mental/emotional health should all have an active and vibrant part of your life. Not one dominates all other aspects of your life."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 15. Strive for High Emotional Intelligence "Having a high intelligence quotient is great, but having a high emotional intelligence quotient can be better in terms of long-term stability. Especially in high-stress situations, or in leadership roles, what defines a good leader is often not their intelligence, but their level of maturity and control of their emotions."   Christopher Hollingsworth, MD 16. Take a Magnesium Supplement "Magnesium is known as the anti-stress mineral and serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that is boosted artificially by some medications, depends on magnesium for its production and function. Magnesium also regulates melatonin production for better, more rejuvenating sleep. I recommend 500mg-600mg of elemental magnesium as an optimal daily amount. Not all forms of magnesium are easily absorbed by the body. Mix magnesium citrate powder in filtered or spring water and squeeze a half a lemon and stir, hot or cold, and just sip this throughout the day. "   Carolyn Dean, MD, ND, Medical Advisory Board Member, Nutritional Magnesium Association 17. Get Plenty of Sleep "Get enough quality sleep (usually 7-8 hours per day for adults). Practice good sleep hygiene: try to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, if you possibly can, weekends included. If you can't sleep after about 15-20 minutes, leave your bedroom, and go to a different room if you can. Do a quiet activity (no media or devices   think: reading or meditation) until you start to feel tired, and then you can return to your bed. Your bed should be for sleep (and sex) only."   Lisa Doggett, MD 18. Joke Around "Practice humor. Even just putting a smile on your face improves your immunity. The reason there are two comedy channels in my hospital is that we teach patients to use humor for health."   Murray Grossan, MD 19. Get Moving "When stressed or depressed, it can feel almost impossible to find the motivation to get up and moving. Fatigue and decrease in motivation and energy can be a few of the many side effects of feeling stressed and depressed. One reason for feeling this way is that when we are depressed, our brains are likely not producing or releasing enough of the 'neurotransmitter of happiness' called serotonin. Countless studies have shown that exercise increases both serotonin production and release, and is the reason most feel better after they get out and moving."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 20. Get Proper Medication If You Need It Once you visit with a medical professional, you may need to be put on medication. It's not shameful; sometimes, taking the proper medication can help improve your mental state. "Medications can also help set right the biochemistry within the brain," says Gary J. Kerkvliet, MD. 21. Practice Mindfulness "Learn what mindfulness is and incorporate it into your daily life. Meditation is a form of mindfulness and has powerful benefits for mental health."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 22. Hang Out with Friends and Family "When we have friends or family near us during stressful times, allowing them to give you a hug will trigger your brain to produce and release the attachment hormones called oxytocin and vasopressin. This makes us feel love and connected; thereby, likely decreasing the feelings of sadness, loneliness and stress."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 23. Learn Counted Breathing "Hourly, do one-minute counted breathing. Inhale count four and exhale count six. This sends a message to your amygdala to reduce stress hormones, and counting puts your anterior lobe onto "nice" subjects. Over a six-week period, your overall stress chemistry will be reduced."   Murray Grossan, MD 24. Start Journaling "Write in a journal! I have written in a journal nearly every night since I was 11 years old, but it's never too late to start! Writing down your worries can provide a release and help you move past them. I also find that re-reading old journal entries gives me perspective and provides me with a wisdom that helps me through more recent challenges."   Lisa Doggett, MD 25. Talk to a Friend Who is a Good Listener "If you have a friend that you can elicit to help you, ask them to listen to the thoughts you are having and help you reframe them."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 26. Avoid the People You Need to "Avoidance gets a bad rap. There is nothing wrong with avoiding situations and people who will bring stress, worry or sadness into your life. If people or situations don't add to your life, maybe it shouldn't be in your life."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 27. Learn to Say No "Learn to say 'no' to people and activities that will make you feel drained or overwhelmed. By saying 'no,' you are then saying 'yes' to your own mental health and more rejuvenating activities."   Lisa Doggett, MD 28. Try to Forget the Sad Thoughts "When stressed or depressed, we are usually having worrisome, sad or overall negative thoughts. Studies show that thinking of or remembering sad events decreases serotonin production in a part of our brain that helps us to be able to control attention. What this means is that by continuing to think of sad events, it makes it less likely we will be able to focus on anything else; this is why it is so difficult to get ourselves out of the negative thinking loop."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 29. Exercise Every Day "Exercise has been key for me to avoid depression and anxiety, and some studies show it can be as effective as medication for mild depression. I exercise every day, no matter what, first thing in the morning before I have an excuse to skip it."   Lisa Doggett, MD 30. Look at Your Happy Photos "Look at photos that you have taken that remind you of positive times, as this may help stimulate serotonin production, helping you to feel better."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW 31. Stay in the Moment "Mindfulness: Stay in the moment. Don't dwell on things past or worry about the future."   Gary J. Kerkvliet, MD 32. Eat Healthy Meals "Eat three healthy meals a day, with lots of fruits and vegetables, and avoid too many snacks or sodas."   Lisa Doggett, MD 33. Try an Anti-Inflammatory Diet "Anxiety and depression can be mitigated through modifications of lifestyle changes in diet, exercise and counseling services. In relation to improving lifestyle, a key factor is an anti-inflammatory diet through decreasing sugar intake and gluten."   Muneer Imam, MD, Medical Director of the Center for Integrative and Innovative Therapies 34. Prepare for the Next Stressful Situation "Emotionally inoculate yourself. Use the techniques of visual imagery, preparation and fact-finding to ward off stress and prepare for stressful situations."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 35. Find Work You Love "Find work that you enjoy. So much of our lives is spent at work   finding a job that helps you meet your goals and where you feel valued and productive is so important!"   Lisa Doggett, MD 36. Avoid Alcohol and Drugs "Avoid drugs (including tobacco and marijuana) and avoid heavy drinking. Substances can have a major effect on mental health and sleep. Men generally should not drink more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day, and women should limit themselves to one."   Lisa Doggett, MD 37. Don't Overdo it on the Caffeine "Avoid too much caffeine, especially if prone to anxiety, though 1-2 cups of coffee or tea per day is completely fine. Don't drink caffeine within about eight hours of sleep if you are sensitive to it."   Lisa Doggett, MD 38. Focus on What You Can Control "Try not to worry about things you have no control over, focus on things you do have control over."   Christopher Hollingsworth, MD 39. Ask for Help "Ask for help when you need it, and give help when someone else needs it. Both go a long way to improving mental health."   Lisa Doggett, MD 40. Be Honest With Your Doctor "Good communication with your doctor or other professionals you see for mental health concerns is essential. Also, be honest! Your doctor or counselor can't help you unless they understand the full, true picture of what you are experiencing. Honesty is essential in building a trusting relationship."   Lisa Doggett, MD 41. Get in Shape "Be in great physical health. The mind/body interaction is powerful. A healthy body leads to a healthy mind, and a healthy mind leads to a healthy body."   John Mayer, Ph.D, Clinical Psychologist at Doctor On Demand 42. Know Yourself "Know yourself in order to be better able to control your emotions."   Christopher Hollingsworth, MD 43. Turn to Your Hobbies "The best way to decrease the stress is by playing with it wisely. We should try spending more time on our hobbies or something that would elevate our mood, be it catching up with our old friends or chatting to family, so that we get a more positive outlook in life and build up a strong barrier so that stress cannot attack us easily."   Lisa Doggett, MD 44. Find a Support Group "Try to help yourself by seeking out community support groups and learning as much as you can about your illness."   Christopher Hollingsworth, MD 45. Go Out in Public "The human brain is hardwired for social and emotional engagement, and our basic human need is to be heard and understood."   Danielle Forshee, Psy.D, LCSW

Credit scores of 719 (for a new car) or 655 (for a used car) or higher will help you qualify for the lowest auto loan interest rates. Even if your credit score is lower, you may still qualify for a decent rate. If you don't know your credit score, you can check it for free on Bankrate . How can I get the best car loan interest rate? Borrowers with a lower credit score may see higher auto interest rates. If your credit score is on the lower end (around 500), some lenders may offer higher interest rates. Taking steps to improve your credit score can go a long way toward getting a better interest rate. What's the difference between new and used car interest rates? Loans for newer cars tend to have lower interest rates than those for used cars. Lenders see newer cars as less of a risk -- they're less likely to break down, and lenders can identify exactly how much they'll depreciate over time. Newer cars have more predictable resale value down the line than newer cars, and that predictability results in a lower interest rate. What are other important car ownership costs to consider? Beyond the cost of monthly car loan payments, car insurance can be a significant expense. Make sure you understand car insurance rates and the best car insurance companies available in order to select the best car insurance coverage for your needs.

Kudos for its exceptional off-roadability and tool-like nature; gripes are a wish for more power and a slightly quieter engine, and compromised on-road handling due to the tallish tires and high center of gravity. (We've driven Xterras equipped with +1 aftermarket 16-in. wheel/tire packages, and that makes all the difference-something to consider if most of your driving keeps you on the pavement.) It also served our "MT TV" crew during Sport/Utility of the Year testing and filming; fold down the rear seats, mount the camera in back, and "Action." We've had no mechanical problems of note, other than the still sticky shift/brake interlock and a lack of spring in the strut units that hold up the rear deck. We'll have them addressed during the 15K service. Logbook Quote"It delivers most of the goodness of more costly sport/utilities, but for a ton less cash." Base price $25,799 Price as tested $26,398 Vehicle layout Frt eng, 4WD, 5-door, 5-pass Engine 3.3L V-6, SOHC, 2 valve/cyl Hp @ rpm 170 @ 4800 Torque @ rpm {{{200}}} @ 2800 Transmission 4-speed automatic 0-60 mph, sec 10.9 EPA mpg 15 city/19 hwy Total mileage 14,593 Avg test mpg 15.9 Problem areas Balky shifter interlock; weak deck struts Non-warr cost $0 2000 Subaru Legacy OutbackOur Outback's days with us are about done. It served frequent duty as photo-shoot support vehicle and as a weekender for one editor who has a place in the mountains. That same editor attended an event near Phoenix and snagged the Subie for the 800-mile round trip. He noticed what others have complained about: a loud and irritating wind howl coming from the A-pillar area at around 75 mph. His other road notes: "Interior is well appointed and driving position is near perfect for me, though front seat lumbar support is too high and too firm. Center stack layout is good, with rotary HVAC controls and a stereo with decent-size buttons." He wasn't as happy with the "road map shiftgate that makes three-point turns a frustrating adventure." Brake pedal is also a bit soft, though there's no shortage of actual stoppage power. The Outback's trip to the dealer was totally routine: an oil and filter change, top off fluids. Say buh-bye. Logbook Quote"At nearly five grand less, this is probably a better buy than the new six-cylinder." Base price $26,095 Price as tested $27,650 Vehicle layout Frt eng, AWD, 5-door, 5-pass Engine 2.5L flat four, DOHC, 4 valve/cyl Hp @ rpm 165 @ 5600 Torque @ rpm 162 @ {{{4000}}} Transmission 4-speed automatic 0-60 mph, sec 10.5 EPA mpg 22 city/27 hwy Total mileage 12,583 Avg test mpg 20.1 Problem areas None Non-warr cost $0 2002 Porsche BoxsterWe loved our previous Boxster long-term test car, but sent it back to Stuttgart with a list: "More power!" we demanded. "More tactile interior trim," we requested. "Why not a six speed?" we whined. Porsche responded by saying "Take that!"-in the form of a new Boxster S. We said "Yessssssssss." The S packs everything we talked about, and a lot more, for its base price of $49,930. To that we added Black Metallic paint ($805), Sport Package ($2235), traction control ($870), 18-in. Turbo Look alloy wheels ($1190), an Exclusive Options charge (whatever that is, at $381) plus D&D ($765) for a total of $56,346. So far, the 3.2L/250-hp version of the Boxster's horizontally opposed six, close ratio six-speed transaxle, and confidence-inspiring Carrera brake system have alone proven themselves worth the cost differential over the already improved standard Boxster.

One interesting comment was: "As the MPV is a bit smaller and sportier than other minivans, it's the one that even single people would consider." We missed the 15,000-mile service by a bit, but to no harm. Our dealer performed a factory recall adjustment to the emissions system, as well as the usual round of oil, oil filter, air filter, and cabin filter changes. A slight brake shudder showed up, and the dealer technician noted, "Rotors are slightly warped, but the pads are still fine-would leave it alone for now. So when the pads go, the brake job will have to include replacement of the front rotors. Besides the usual around-town duty, the MPV was loaded to the gills with guys and gear for our annual trek to the SEMA show in Las Vegas. The occasional cold-start problem we mentioned previously has gone away, perhaps due to the emissions systems adjustment. Logbook Quote"Who needs power doors? These are light and easy to operate."

On our walk to work, on public transit, even outside of our homes. And it's hard to pass people in need constantly, but it's also hard to know how to fix such an overwhelming problem.	San Franciscans encounter homelessness every day. On our walk to work, on public transit, even outside of our homes. And it's hard to pass people in need constantly, but it's also hard to know how to fix such an overwhelming problem. One user on Reddit was curious how to help, and their simple question, "Former homeless people of reddit , what can we do to help homeless people the most?, " at press time had over 2,300 comments offering suggestions. The entire thread is worth a look; it's full of thoughtful responses and interesting conversations. But the thing that stands out the most   other than the heartbreaking family circumstances that so often led to homelessness in teen users   is the kindness of strangers. "When people ask homeless what do you need, they are thinking about objects, things like hats, sock and gloves or any other things useful in routine life. These objects make a small difference," one user wrote. "But the most important things are not objects. Things that make most impact and helps someone are non-objects. Dignity. Kindness and understanding. Encouragement." "I lived in my car for 3 months and the only part that wore on my sanity was feeling different and looked down on by everyone that could see my situation," user name76 wrote, echoing the sentiments of many other posters. "Physical needs weren't that hard to meet." If you want to learn more about homelessness in San Francisco, a great place to start is the Chronicle's homelessness project page .

"I was homeless a few years ago for a couple months. I was quite lucky in that I was very resourceful and street smart as well as clean and sober. I slept on the beach sometimes and in an underground parking lot other times. I eventually figured out the shelter system and that helped me get better access to food and resources. I remember getting help with free food like day old bread and free fruit/sandwiches etc as well as free clothes and I was grateful for all of it. "What I remember most though are the people who saw past the mental illness, past the skittish, scared girl and into the human being underneath. The hotel clerk who let me charge my phone and gave me free coffee, no strings attached; the police officer who told me about shelters instead of writing me a ticket; and the shelter worker who chatted with me about some silly show on tv. "I always remember those people and when I now work with homeless and disadvantaged people I always look for their humanity even when it is hard to find."   Pyid "I think the best help happens through organizations. It's hard to get out of homelessness because each piece a person is missing (a place to live, an income, etc.) makes obtaining all the rest more difficult." "Individual contributions can be helpful, but none of them are the solution. People don't panhandle for change to put a down payment on an apartment. Offering food or socks is appreciated, and certainly a good thing to do. But if you want to help people get out of the situation, only charities or public programs are equipped to provide the holistic support people need."   trebuchetfight "I was not homeless for very long, and I had some money, but was not going to blow it on a hotel when I had a perfectly good car and could hide it for the night down rural streets in my hometown. "I went to Walmart and needed to buy a hat, gloves and thicker socks, as well as some food. My friend's mom saw me there, and somehow she got me to talk about what was going on in my situation. She listened and asked a few questions. Very sweet and kind lady. She told me a story about how she went through something similar. She then INSISTED on purchasing my cart for me. It wasn't much, but I will never forget it."   Starkohren "When I was homeless, it would have been nice if it was made clear the options that were available in regards to finding housing etc. It would have been good to be able to use somewhere as an address for registering for benefits and things like that as I had such a hard time getting my money every fortnight, I was lucky in that I had someone whose address I could use but that could have ended at any time."   ramona1987 "It's community things that help best, I find. I got put on a program for homeless teens where someone came and checked on me every week and took me to a community house thing. We'd do things like learn simple practical or social skills like learning how to cook and fix things or learning how to tie a tie. They'd talk to us and build up friendly relationships. They never tried preaching to us or anything, we were never forced to join in, we could spend the day just being there and watching everything if we wanted. But they treated us like people so everyone always did something. "I didn't really realize it at the time, but looking back that extreme amount of kindness helped a lot. People who didn't know me went out of their way to help me and make sure I was alright just out of the kindness of their heart."   BlueCarmine "I was 18, finally leaving abusive parents. I could only get part time work, and it just wasn't enough to have a roof over my head and food at the same time. A thing that really helped me was this wonderful woman who came up to me while I was panhandling in the rain - she gave me a backpack, and a heavy wool coat. The backpack was full of socks, gloves, hand-warmers, a beanie, toiletries, and a letter from her saying everything would be OK. "In one fell swoop, she gave me warmth, and dignity."   Capt_Gingerbeard "There needs to be more opportunities for homeless or otherwise desperate people to do community oriented work. Where I live there used to be a program that had street people volunteering to pick up trash and hang holiday decorations and such. It was only for an hour or two at a time and in exchange they got access to laundry and showers and such, in addition to a daily meal available for all. "People don't realize that the toughest part of being homeless isn't going without food. Of all the struggles, food is the easiest. Other things, like bathing, sleeping, s------g, are a little tougher, but you learn to take care of your needs fairly quickly. It's the time that gets you. You're outside, somewhat uncomfortable, maybe asking for handouts, being told to move along, get a job, etc, for hours and hours. Feeling totally useless messes with your head. The idea of getting wasted is very appealing. You start to resent "housies." Other homeless people are the only ones you relate to. It becomes a trap. If you don't have a safety net out there you eventually lose any desire to rejoin society. "So just about any low pressure activity would be really helpful for homeless people to snap out of their rut and build some kind of connection to the community."   moreLSDplease "My boyfriend was homeless for a period of his life because of an abusive parent. He was lucky enough to have friends and family that helped to pull him out of his situation, but it obviously had a huge impact on how he lives his life. "He always carries a few pre-made packs with toothpaste and a toothbrush, deodorant, disposable razors and shaving cream, socks, hand/feet warmers, etc. When he sees someone who needs help he gives them a pack and cash if he has it on him. "But the best and most truly invaluable thing he does for the homeless people he meets is he stops and has a real conversation with them. He listens and shares stories and treats them with respect and dignity... "He always tells me that it's not the money people need, it's normalcy. A daily routine and normal social interaction. Brushing your teeth, combing your hair, saying hello to your neighbor, and spending your day doing normal things and feeling normal. Too many cannot find this normalcy and so they turn to drugs and alcohol to escape their reality. Because they think they'll never feel normal again."   jproxduh "Don't just throw money at them. When I was on the street, a guy came up to me and gave me a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush. I really needed them but the change people gave me went towards food because it was a necessity. It was amazing and he stopped by and had a chat with me. He understood what I needed and it made my day."   iamprocrastinating_ "I was somewhat homeless, as in I was living in cheap hotels. It was not uncommon that I checked out of one hotel and couldn't check in to the next for several hours. Sometimes I drove from one city to another and pulled over to take a nap. Nothing scared the s--- out of me like someone banging on my window. The person would say they were just seeing if I was okay ... I was, but you might have just given me a f------ heart attack."   shrinkingviolet219 Hoping to help your neighbors in need this holiday season?

BBIq49J	autos	autosreview	2018 Volkswagen Golf Alltrack	2018 Volkswagen Golf Alltrack	Overview: The Volkswagen Golf has long been one of our favorite cars, blending practicality with effortless athleticism and grace. What started in the mid-1970s as a single hatchback has grown into a lineup with more variations than are offered by some entire car companies. And with each new member of the family, we find ourselves newly impressed. The all-wheel-drive, wagonoid Alltrack, which first hit streets in the United States as a 2017 model, is no exception. Essentially a lifted Golf SportWagen with beefier plastic exterior trim, the Alltrack very slightly expands the family and takes aim squarely between Subaru's Crosstrek and Outback. Subaru's faithful could teach Catholics a thing or two about devotion, but for those who can be convinced to look further afield, the Alltrack is an excellent alternative a new flavor of granola, if you will. What's New: The Alltrack was lightly tweaked for 2018. A refreshed front end, new headlights and taillights, and a new infotainment system make up the bulk of the changes. The new look is sharp and modern, and the available LED headlights are a definite aesthetic and functional improvement on last year's standard halogen and optional bixenon bulbs. Inside, on SE and SEL trim levels the new MIB II infotainment system stretches the 8.0-inch touchscreen to include the menu buttons that surround the display screen, with volume and tuning knobs representing the only topographic features. (Base S models get a 6.5-inch unit with physical buttons surrounding the screen.) The new system looks better and is as ergonomically sound as the previous setup but feels laggy. Equipment has been shuffled among the trim levels, too, with active-safety equipment becoming standard across more of the lineup What We Like: It's a Volkswagen Golf wagon what's not to like? The Alltrack exhibits the same polish under hard driving as its hatchback siblings but offers a soft-road-ready all-wheel-drive system (with brake-based torque vectoring for tight corners) and 13 cubic feet of extra cargo space behind the second row. The Alltrack's body cladding and slightly lifted ride height give it a rugged façade, which could help this wagon attract some buyers who might otherwise choose a crossover. We like the Alltrack just as it is, and we're happy to see more Golfs of all stripes on the market. What We Don't Like: The Alltrack, along with the rest of the Golf family, has won two consecutive 10Best Cars awards, so there's not much to gripe about. The raised suspension adds a little more body roll during hard cornering, but it's mostly inconsequential. The Alltrack is quite a bit more expensive than the almost identical Golf SportWagen, however, a car that can be equipped in its lowest S trim level with the same 4Motion all-wheel-drive system. Opting for that setup precludes some of the high-luxe and high-tech features that can be had on an Alltrack, but we might keep the cash and skip the lane-keeping assist in favor of the lower ride height anyway. Also, manual-trans Alltracks are limited in the twist department, with 184 lb-ft of torque to the automatic's 199. But, hey, at least VW still offers a manual. Verdict: We may someday tire of Volkswagen's expansion of the Golf family, but today is not that day.

Back in 1968, the company issued 16 car and truck models roughly sized to fit in our Matchbox car carrying cases, but with their wheel-wells hogged out to accommodate what looked like red-line Polyglas tires on Hurst alloy wheels, spinning on polished wire axles. They might have been sized and variably scaled like Matchbox cars, but these bright metallic customized babies were fast. Not surprisingly the first 16 models included most of the pony cars Camaro coupe, Firebird convertible, Mustang fastback, Cougar, and Barracuda. But because those other guys didn't establish the marketing arrangements like Chevy has, big kids eager to celebrate this milestone with a big-boy car (or perhaps replace their aging 45th anniversary 2013 Camaro Hot Wheels Special Edition ) will need to head back to their Chevy dealers. Research Chevy's latest models on MSN Autos The 2018 Hot Wheels Camaro will break cover in Las Vegas at the SEMA show.

Orange brake calipers, seat inserts, and interior upholstery stitching are included along with gray and silver stripes and gray forged 20-inch wheels (shod in summer tires on SS models) that again ape those early fast-spinning ones. Also included in the deal are a unique grille with chrome inserts, a ground effects package, dark-lens tail amps set in a black panel with the Hot Wheels emblem, a 50th Anniversary Hot Wheels badge on the steering wheel, carpeted floor mats with orange stitching and "ghost" stripes, and doorsill plates with a light-up stripe of orange. Coupes also get a unique spoiler, but convertibles must retain their stock wing because it incorporates various radio, GPS, and telematics antennas. This package adds $4,995 to a 2LT grade V-6 or 2SS V-8 Camaro, so budget at least $36,490 for a V-6 coupe and $53,990 for a V-8 convertible both of which go on sale in February 2018. That's actually down from the $6,995 pricing of the Kinetic Blue 45th-anniversary 2013 package. Then, as now, no performance upgrades were included. Is owning one of a scheduled run of 2,500 V-6 or V-8 street-legal Camaros not quite "collectible" enough for you? Well then register here, and pray that the independent third-party selects you to be invited to purchase one of the 69 race-ready COPO Camaros that will be built for 2018 and specify the Hot Wheels edition upgrade. The 2018 COPO Camaro making its debut in Las Vegas at the SEMA show will feature this package, except its paint is a slightly different metallic "Supercrush" orange with a much more elaborate Hot Wheels graphics package (production Hot Wheels COPOs will get Crush paint). The show car will be fitted with a new 302-cubic-inch racing engine based on the LT1 V-8 offered in the stock SS but built for drag racing with many unique components, including a shorter-stroke crankshaft that enables exceptional high-rpm capability. (Other COPO engine options include a naturally aspirated 427 or supercharged 350, the latter of which can put down 8-second quarter-mile runs at nearly 160 mph. All COPO Camaros get an SFI-approved ATI TurboHydramatic 400 three-speed automatic transmission and a drag-optimized live-axle rear suspension.) As for COPO Hot Wheels package pricing, we're only told that it's likely to be "considerably more" than $4,995. But hey, it's only money, and unlike your Hot Wheels collection back in the day, you can't take it with you. Pub Ammo: The Custom Camaro was first among the original "sweet sixteen" Hot Wheels vehicles to be released in 1968. It came in some 20 colors, with Gold and Creamy Pink being the rarest.

With models ranging from the workaday XL to the luxurious Limited trim to the off-road special SVT Raptor, the F-150 lineup has a little something for everybody.	Vehicle Overview The 2014 Ford F-150 is a versatile full-size pickup that can be configured in a number of ways. With models ranging from the workaday XL to the luxurious Limited trim to the off-road special SVT Raptor, the F-150 lineup has a little something for everybody. The 2014 F-150 range includes the following trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, FX2 and FX4, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum, Limited, Tremor, and SVT Raptor. Powering the F-150 lineup are four engines. The base engine is the 3.7-liter V-6, which produces 302 hp and 278 lb-ft of torque. Above that are two V-8 engines, including a 5.0-liter unit making 360 hp and 380 lb-ft, and a 6.2-liter producing 411 hp and 434 lb-ft. The twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 rounds out the F-150's engine offerings, producing 365 hp and 420 lb-ft. All engines come paired to a six-speed automatic transmission with a shifter-mounted switch for manual gear changes. Rear-drive is standard on most trim levels, with four-wheel drive available. Models with the naturally aspirated V-6 are EPA-rated at 17/23 mpg city/highway, while turbocharged EcoBoost models are rated at 16/22 mpg in rear-drive trim and 15/21 mpg with four-wheel drive. The 5.0-liter V-8 is rated at 15/21 mpg, while the 6.2-liter V-8 achieves 13/18 mpg in rear-drive models, 12/16 mpg in four-wheel-drive pickups, or 11/16 mpg in the off-road-focused SVT Raptor. A number of different rear axles are available, including a locking 4.10 differential for the F-150 Tremor sport truck. Tow ratings range from 5500-11,300 pounds, depending on equipment. Three bed sizes are offered along with three cab styles. The F-150 Tremor is only available as a regular cab, while the King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited are only available in Supercrew. We liked the Ford F-150 enough to name it our 2012 Truck of the Year . During that rigorous program, we said of two F-150 testers we sampled, "Regardless of the drivetrain, the judges were unanimously impressed with the F-150's ability to earn its keep. In towing or hauling, the consensus was both trucks only got better the harder they were working." The EcoBoost engine deserves particular praise for its V-8-like performance and reasonable fuel economy for a full-size pickup. Like the body, the F-150's cabin can be configured in numerous ways. Base XL models feature a front bench seat and column shifter in regular cab format, and all others receive front bucket seats with a center console storage bin. Cloth seats, manual locks, manual air conditioning, and an AM/FM radio are standard on XL models. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the range-topping Limited model features standard leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, rearview camera with parking sensors, power tilt/telescope steering wheel with memory, heated and cooled front seats, passive keyless entry, remote start, a 10-speaker CD audio system with MP3 playback capability, USB and iPod interface, Sync with MyFord Touch infotainment and Bluetooth, and a navigation system as standard. The Ford F-150 was named a Top Safety Pick by the IIHS, scoring ratings of Good in all categories except the new small overlap front crash test (the truck has yet to be tested). The 2014 Ford F-150 received a four-star rating out of a possible five from the NHTSA. New for 2014 The F-150 Tremor sport truck joins the lineup for 2014, offering EcoBoost power, a short wheelbase, and locking rear differential. A natural gas option arrives for the 3.7-liter V-6 .

Featuring athletic handling and a well-tuned ride, this sleek and sporty coupe is among our top-ranked luxury small cars.	Few cars can match the performance chops of the 2018 BMW 2 Series. Featuring athletic handling and a well-tuned ride, this sleek and sporty coupe is among our top-ranked luxury small cars. The 2018 BMW 2-Series is ranked: #6 in Luxury Small Cars #5 in Luxury Convertibles Is the BMW 2 Series a Good Car? The BMW 2 Series is a great car. Not only is it one of the most athletic cars in the class, but it also provides a comfortable ride. The base four-cylinder engine delivers quick acceleration, though spirited drivers will most likely prefer one of the more powerful six-cylinders. The 2 Series has a refined, well-built cabin, and it's available in both coupe and convertible versions. The 2 Series also has a good reputation for safety and reliability. Should I Buy the BMW 2 Series? If you don't plan on carrying passengers in the back row often and you want the prestige of owning a BMW, you should consider purchasing the 2 Series. That said, you'll want to be careful when adding options to your 2 Series, since the cost for upgrades tends to add up quickly. For a more accommodating rear seat, consider the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the Audi A3 . The Alfa Romeo Giulia is another thrilling sports sedan that performance-minded shoppers should take a spin in. Compare the 2 Series, A3, and Giulia » Should I Buy a New or Used BMW 2 Series? The 2018 2 Series is a part of a generation that started in 2014, and there have been few changes since then. That means you could opt for an older model and get a similar car for less money. All-wheel drive and a convertible body style became available in the 2015 model year. The performance-oriented M2 was introduced in the 2016 model year. Increased horsepower, reshuffled standard and available features, and enhanced exterior styling are notable changes to the 2017 2 Series. If you're interested in a used model, check out our reviews of the 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 BMW 2 Series . If you decide an older model is right for you, check out our Used Car Deals page for savings and incentives on used vehicles.

To keep our recommendations unbiased, we decline expensive gifts from carmakers, and a third party handles our advertising. How Much Does the BMW 2 Series Cost? The 2018 2 Series costs less than most new cars in its class. Prices for the BMW 2 Series coupe range from $34,950 for the 230i to $45,450 for the M240i. Both models also come in convertible form (sticker prices start at $40,750 and $50,050, respectively), and you can add all-wheel drive to any model for $2,000. The performance-oriented 2018 M2 costs $54,500. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local BMW dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our BMW deals page . BMW 2 Series Versus the Competition Which Is Better: BMW 2 Series or Mercedes-Benz C-Class? While the BMW 2 Series leans more towards performance, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is more of a touring car. Choosing between these two cars comes down to what type of driving you favor. Though the 2 Series is the winner when it comes to performance, the Mercedes still holds its own with a powerful lineup of engines. In terms of interior opulence, the C-Class takes the cake. The Mercedes also offers more rear-seat passenger space, but it costs $5,300 more than the BMW. Which Is Better: BMW 2 Series or Audi TT? Available as either a four-seat coupe or a two-seat convertible, the Audi TT is a luxury sports car with sleek exterior styling and cutting-edge technology. However, its midrange performance can't match the power and handling of the BMW 2 Series. The TT also costs roughly $9,000 more than the 2 Series and offers less passenger and cargo space. Go with the BMW. Which Is Better: BMW 2 Series or Audi A3? The Audi A3 doesn't fare as well as the BMW 2 Series in our rankings, but it offers its own set of strengths. As a sedan, the A3 offers easier access to the rear seats and more legroom than the 2 Series. In addition, the A3 has more standard features than the Bimmer including heated front seats and leather upholstery and lively performance. That said, the 2 Series delivers sportier performance and rates higher for predicted reliability. For additional space and features, go for the A3. Otherwise, the BMW 2 Series is a better all-around vehicle. Compare the 2 Series, C-Class, and TT » 2 Series Interior How Many People Does the 2 Series Seat? Both coupe and convertible 2 Series models are four-seaters, with standard synthetic leather upholstery and a split-folding back seat. The front seats have 10 power adjustments, making it easy for a variety of body shapes to set a cozy driving position. Like many small luxury cars, the 2 Series has cramped back seats that are best left for kids. 2 Series and Car Seats Caregivers will appreciate how easy it is to find and use this BMW's LATCH hardware, which includes two full sets of lower and upper anchors on each rear seat. 2 Series Interior Quality The 2 Series' cabin is exquisite. Lots of top-notch materials are on hand, creating an atmosphere that wouldn't be out of place in a much pricier vehicle. 2 Series Cargo Space The BMW 2 Series coupe has more trunk space than a Mercedes-Benz C-Class , Audi A3 , and Alfa Romeo Giulia . Plus, you can expand the 13.8-cubic-foot trunk (in coupe models) by folding down the rear seats. Convertible models have slightly less space. 2 Series Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The 2 Series comes with BMW's iDrive infotainment system, Bluetooth, and HD Radio. The infotainment system is a bit cumbersome at first, but once you're familiar with it, you'll find the interface is intuitively laid out. Voice commands and a touchpad are available, but innovative features like BMW's gesture control are still reserved for the 5 Series and not offered in the 2018 2 Series. Upgrades worth considering include wireless Apple CarPlay, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound system, and an 8.8-inch touch screen. Read more about interior » 2 Series Performance 2 Series Engine: A Potent Suite of Engines For 2018, the 2 Series comes in three iterations, each with a distinct engine. The good news is that each is tuned to deliver exhilarating acceleration, even the base four-cylinder power plant of the 230i. Performance junkies will prefer the six-cylinder power of the M240i or M2, but be prepared to pay to play, as each adds a significant sum to your price tag. For spirited drivers, the extra cost will be worth it. 2 Series Gas Mileage: Base Model Is Above Average The 2018 230i gets better fuel economy than most of its rivals in our luxury small car rankings . It gets an EPA-estimated 24 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway. This drops to 21 mpg city/30 mpg highway for the M240i, and 20/26 mpg for the M2. 2 Series Ride and Handling: Thrilling BMW's tuning on the 2 Series is where much of the magic lies. This car is one of the most athletic in its class, and elements like responsive steering and dynamic suspension make it a joy to drive. BMW's available M Sport adaptive suspension gives you the ability to pick from a firm, sporty ride or a softer experience as well. Rear-wheel drive is standard (and the only setup for the M2), and BMW's xDrive all-wheel-drive system is available in the 230i and M240i models for $2,000. Read more about performance » 2 Series Reliability Is the BMW 2 Series Reliable? The 2018 BMW 2 Series has a great predicted reliability rating of four out of five from J.D. Power. BMW 2 Series Warranty The 2018 2 Series comes with a four-year/50,000-mile limited warranty. Read more about reliability » 2 Series Safety 2 Series Crash Test Results The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awards the 2018 2 Series with the highest rating of Good in all crash tests performed and names it a Top Safety Pick. 2 Series Safety Features The 2 Series comes standard with rain-sensing windshield wipers and a rearview camera. Additional safety features include front and rear parking sensors, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, high-beam assist, automatic high beams, adaptive headlights, real-time speed limit information, and an active driving assistant that prompts you to slow down before a curve. Read more about safety » Which BMW 2 Series Model Is Right for Me? The 2018 2 Series comes in three trim levels (230i, M240i, and M2), with horsepower increasing as you move up in price and trim. If you're building a 230i, your first decision is between three design packages (Sport Line, Luxury, and M Sport), followed by the choice to add amenities via the Convenience Tier or Premium Tier. Additional 2 Series options include bundles like the Track Handling package, which adds high-performance brakes, steering, and suspension. You can also select between standalone options like Apple CarPlay, a navigation system, and wireless charging for enabled smartphones. For Bimmer fans, there is no substitute for an M2, but you can get pretty close with the M240i and save yourself $9,050 in the process (the difference in starting price between the two). The M240i comes with a turbocharged six-cylinder engine, performance-tuned components, and unique body panels. BMW 2 Series 230i The 230i is the entry-level edition. Prices start at $34,950 for the two-door coupe ($40,750 for the convertible) and include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive. A six-speed manual transmission is available for no extra charge, while adding all-wheel drive bumps up the price by $2,000. Standard tech features include BMW's iDrive infotainment system, a 6.5-inch touch screen, a seven-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, a USB port, HD Radio, push-button start, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and a rearview camera. SensaTec upholstery (BMW's synthetic leather), a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and automatic climate control are also included. BMW 2 Series M240i The M240i comes as a coupe ($45,450) or a convertible ($50,050). Its standard drivetrain consists of a 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive. Like the 230i, a no-cost manual transmission and a $2,000 xDrive all-wheel-drive system is available. The M240i also comes with a model-specific body kit, a moonroof, ambient lighting, sport exhaust, M Sport brakes, and adaptive M suspension. BMW 2 Series M2 The top-of-the-line M2 is only available as a rear-wheel-drive coupe. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission; a $2,900 seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is on the options list. Standard features include an 8.8-inch touch screen, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound system, carbon fiber trim, leather upholstery, front seats with 14-way power adjustments and heat, and a proximity key. In addition to suspension and handling upgrades, the M2's performance enhancements include an M-tuned exhaust with quad tailpipes, a track-ready cooling system, and an M rear spoiler.

AA5bw9B	health	nutrition	The 20 worst things you can eat and why	We'd advise consuming these foods as infrequently as possible.	We'd advise consuming these foods as infrequently as possible. Eating healthy is about moderation, choosing "real" foods over fake processed ones, and portion control. It's also about making the right decisions and educating yourself as to why some foods are healthier than others. Read on to learn not only which foods are the worst that you can eat, but why they're so bad for you. Sausage Sausages (which includes everything from hot dogs to Slim Jims, bologna and salami), by definition, are processed. When you process meat (which serves to keep it fresh longer, among other things) by smoking, curing, salting it or preserving it via chemicals, you're loading it up with sodium, and the meat used usually also contains a ton of saturated fat, boosting the fat and cholesterol content into the stratosphere. Not only does sausage contain very little in the way of nutrients, excessive consumption has also been linked to colon cancer. Bacon Bacon may be one of the most delicious foods on earth, but it's also (unfortunately) horrible for you. Three slices of bacon contains about one-fifth of the suggested daily sodium allowance, but it's also cured using nitrates and smoke, which can contribute to increased chances of cancer and heart disease. Bacon is also fried in its own fat, which is full of saturated fat and cholesterol.More: If you need bacon in your life, check out these ridiculous bacon products you didn't know existed. Frozen dinners TV dinners might be convenient, but very few have anything to offer in the way of nutritional value. They're also pumped full of fat, calories and sodium in order to make something that's just been microwaved after sitting in a freezer for months palatable. Frozen dinners that are low in fat are also unhealthy, even though advertisements might tell you otherwise; they're still highly processed, and full of chemicals and sodium.More: Make sure you know before you buy. These are the 10 unhealthiest frozen dinners. Burgers The average restaurant burger contains upwards of 20 percent fat, which means that a fifth of that patty is pure animal fat, full of cholesterol and other unhealthy components. Once you start adding cheese and bacon, you drive the fat content into the stratosphere. Also, a supermarket-bought patty can contain meat from hundreds of cows and if just one of them was sick, that can be transmitted to you if the meat isn't cooked through. Our advice: If you're going to eat a burger, make it a small one, make sure the fat content isn't higher than 15 percent and cook it through unless you know it's from a reputable source.More: Ever wonder which fast-food burgers are the worst for you? Here are the 10 unhealthiest fast-food burgers around. Potato chips Potato chips are one of those foods that really have little to no nutritional value whatsoever. They're simply salted deep-fried starch, full of fat, calories, sodium and carbohydrates. To top it off, potato chips contain acrylamide, a carcinogen that forms when food is fried at a high temperature.More: Some chips are unhealthier than others. Click here to see the unhealthiest potato chips. "Diet" foods "Foods labeled 'fat-free' or 'diet' can often contain more sugar and chemicals than their full-fat counterparts," nutritionist Keri Glassman told us. "They end up being less satisfying and are over-consumed."Think of it this way: Fat is flavor, so when the fat comes out, the flavor needs to be replaced somehow, with artificial fillers, chemicals, salt and sugar. It's always healthier to eat real foods, even if they contain fat and calories, than their chemical-laden "diet" counterparts.More: Not only are diet foods bad, but 'diet miracles' are too. These are the ones you might want to avoid. Margarine There was a brief time when it was believed that margarine was healthier than butter, but that's gone out the window. The reason? Trans fats, quite possibly the worst thing you can put into your body, raise bad cholesterol, increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, and even damage the walls of blood vessels. Use a healthier fat like olive oil, or just stick with a small amount of real butter. Artificial sweeteners Sugar substitutes, like Equal, Splenda and Sweet & Low, are pure chemicals: acesulfame potassium, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame and neotame, to be exact. Because they're devoid of sugar and calories, we tend to think we can consume as much of it as we want, but in many ways they're unhealthier than using real, natural sugar. The fact is, we really don't know just how much damage they're causing. Recent research indicates that excessive consumption of artificial sweeteners can result in cardiovascular disease, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.More: Even though they're unhealthy, we taste tested them so you know which one is best for your coffee. Popcorn If you were to buy some popping corn, add a healthy oil and a sprinkling of salt, and pop it yourself, you'd be left with a healthy (if starchy) snack. But let's face it: Nobody actually does that. Microwave popcorn is loaded with chemicals, from the ones lining the bag to make sure oil doesn't leak through to others that prevent the bag from catching on fire. The popcorn itself is also usually coated in preservatives, salt and partially hydrogenated oils (also known as trans fats) masquerading as butter, which is given its flavor via a chemical called diacetyl, which is toxic when inhaled. As for movie theater popcorn, it's one of the unhealthiest things you can eat, especially when topped with that liquid "butter," which is nothing but artificially flavored oil. Movie theater popcorn portions are also simply out of control.More: Ever wonder how unhealthy that movie theater popcorn really is? Bagels Bagels are made with refined white flour, which has had all of its nutritional value processed out of it, and they contain on average upwards of 400 calories. They're also extraordinarily dense, in some cases the equivalent of eating six slices of bread. Once you pile on the butter and cream cheese, you're headed straight for a mid-workday nap. If you must have a bagel, choose a mini-bagel, preferably one with whole grains, and scoop out the middle. Deli meats Like sausages, deli meats are also processed, and you really wouldn't want to see what has to be done to an actual turkey breast in order to turn it into "deli-style" turkey. It's basically liquefied, mixed with fillers and sodium, then re-formed, with the finished product devoid of just about any nutritional value. Stick with the real stuff instead.More: Some deli meats are worse for you than others. These are some you may want to consider cutting back on. Toaster pastries Toaster pastries might be convenient, but they're also unhealthier than you might realize. The crust is made with white flour and unhealthy fats, and the filling is just pure sugar, with next to no actual fruit. Add icing and you're looking at upwards of 10 packets of sugar per two-pack! Now that's not a good way to start your day, is it? Pizza Anyone who's ever eaten a greasy slice of pizza knows that it's unhealthy, but the extent might surprise you. One slice of New York-style pizza can contain up to 500 calories and 10 grams of saturated fat, and the numbers get even higher if you make it deep-dish, which has a much-thicker crust which is usually made with butter. Once you start adding cholesterol-laden toppings like pepperoni and sausage, the unhealthiness factor gets out of control. If you need to eat pizza, stick to thin crust, blot the oil off of it, and use the opportunity to load it up with vegetables.More: We figured out which frozen pizzas are the worst for you. Check out the list here. Cheese The biggest offender on that slice of pizza? The cheese. Cheese is incredibly dense, and is packed with solid milk fat, which is very high in cholesterol and calories. One average-sized cheese cube (the kind you might find in a toothpick at a cocktail party) can contain four grams of fat, more than half of it saturated. By the time you realize that you just downed 10 of them without even thinking about it, you've nearly maxed out your fat quota for the day. Biscuits and gravy Yes, this might be a little specific, but a biscuit topped with cream gravy, usually flecked with chunks of sausage, is basically a heart attack waiting to happen. Biscuits are usually made with shortening in order to make them light and flaky, which is a major source of trans fat, and cream gravy is basically all fat: It starts with a roux (butter mixed 50/50 with refined flour and cooked), then milk or cream is added until it's diluted. Finally, chunks of fatty sausage are mixed in, and the whole mess gets ladled onto the biscuits. Cream gravy is also a common topping for country-fried steak, resulting in one of the unhealthiest foods man has ever produced. Ice cream Ice cream, especially the super-dense premium varieties, is the worst of both worlds: It's heavy cream, which is full of cholesterol, mixed with boatloads of sugar (and other add-ons like brownies and cookies). While it might be tempting to down that whole pint, you might want to cut yourself off after a couple of spoonfuls. Packaged cakes and cookies Few foods contain more trans fats than packaged sweet cakes and cookies. The reason? The addition of partially hydrogenated oils, which help keep the food shelf-stable and moist at the same time. Lots of preservatives are also added to prevent the fat from spoiling. It all amounts to nothing short of a "Frankenfood" that is devoid of just about anything that's natural. And that's before we even get to the sugar and fat content!More: These store bought cookies have calories that will make your head spin. Cinnabon Another specific food, but honestly, these things are so unhealthy that they're in a class all by themselves. A Cinnabon Classic contains 880 calories and 36 grams of fat, 17 of which are saturated. By comparison, a Big Mac contains 550 calories and 29 grams of fat, 10 of which are saturated. Don't forget that this is a dessert, however, so there are nearly 60 grams of sugar, the equivalent of nearly two cans of Coke. How about an apple?
AAAGO2m	foodanddrink	newstrends	Would You Snack on Limeade Oreos?		The real question is: How many have you tried? Fruit Punch Only the Kool-Aid Man would bust through walls and shout "oh yeeaaaaah" over this one. Most of us were left scratching our heads at these vanilla cookies with fruit punch-flavored creme , which was exclusively sold at Walmart last summer. Banana Split Now this is a serious feat of cookie engineering. Banana Split Oreos debuted in the summer of 2013 , and they are all the things: One vanilla cookie, one chocolate, and a filling that's half strawberry-flavored, half banana. Pumpkin Spice As the nation went Pumpkin Spice Latte-crazy, Oreo responded with the perfect cookie to dunk in it. They debuted in 2014 but were so popular that they've returned to stores this fall. Cotton Candy This past February, Oreo made the bold decision to release vanilla Oreos with a pink and blue Cotton Candy-esque filling , giving us hope that spring and happy memories of life without perpetually frozen noses would soon arrive. Berry Burst Back in 2008, Oreo sold Strawberry Milkshake-flavored Oreos . This version, released in 2011, seems like a very subtle twist on the flavor, but it ushered in a wave of fruity Oreo flavors over the next few years. Creamsicle The same summer Oreo said, "Hey, guys, these Berry Burst Ice Cream Oreos are kind of just like Strawberry Milkshake Oreos-but better," it also debuted Creamsicle Oreos , which featured vanilla cookies and a half-orange, half-vanilla filling. Candy Corn In 2012, Oreo got everyone thinking about Halloween a little early, debuting these vanilla Oreos with Candy Corn-flavored creme filling just after Labor Day. Brownie Batter We've been dipping Oreos in chocolate for years, but this new flavor, released in August , took the cookie to a whole new level of decadent-and made us wonder why we've been using our fingers to get that last smidge of brownie batter out of the bowl. We could've been using Oreos THIS WHOLE TIME. Watermelon Watermelon is a summertime must-have, but in cookie form? The fruity filling had mixed reviews when it launched in 2013, though we'd heard it was better received than the candy corn variety . Root Beer Float Transforming drinks and frozen desserts into sandwich cookies has been a popular trend for Oreo, so it only makes sense that the brand would create a mashup of the two . The half-root beer, half-vanilla creme filling initially gave us pause-who wants a cookie that tastes like soda?-but thankfully, the frosting doesn't overpower the cookie. Caramel Apple Oreos with a bright green and brown filling may not look all that appealing at first, but when you realize they're like eating a caramel apple, cookie-crust pie , you'll be shoveling them into your mouth by the handful. Key Lime Pie As our news editor put it, this treat's like pure summer, sandwiched between two vanilla cookies . And they're a lot easier to eat on the go than the real thing. Lemon Twist Oreo's released its lemon flavor with vanilla cookies and chocolate. We're not sure how we feel about the latter combination, though one Tasty Test reviewer admits they're "not nearly as bad as I'd thought they'd be," and even goes as far to say they're "kind of good." Limeade Before there were Key Lime Pie Oreos, there were Limeade ones . It was a summer 2014 limited-edition treat served alongside Fruit Punch Oreos, suggesting that someone in the R&D department was clearly on a fruity drink kick. (Considering this lime trend, we have to wonder what summer 2016 has in store for us: Margarita Oreos, perhaps?) Gingerbread If you didn't want to go through the trouble of baking your own gingerbread cookies in 2012, Oreo had your back, releasing cookies with a gingerbread filling loaded with cinnamon flavor. They made a repeat appearance during the holiday season in 2013, so who knows-they could come back again this year. Fingers crossed. Marshmallow Crispy In February 2014, Oreo turned two beloved, gooey treats into sandwich cookies: cookie dough and marshmallow crispy treats . The latter featured a vaguely marshmallow-y creme filling studded with crisped cereal bits. Red Velvet The Internet collectively lost its mind when Red Velvet Oreos hit stores this past February, and it marked a surprising change for the brand: The chocolate cookies were red to match the cake, while most limited-edition flavors tend to be plain chocolate or vanilla. Cream cheese-flavored filling helped the treat stand out from Oreo's OG cookie. Triple Double Neapolitan If Double Stuf and Mega Stuf Oreos weren't enough Oreo for you (or if the frosting-to-cookie ratio was just off), Triple-Double Oreos are your jam ... er, dessert. This version paired vanilla cookies with chocolate and strawberry creme fillings, presumably so you could eat the cookie the way everyone eats Neapolitan ice cream: Consuming all of the chocolate and throwing out the rest. Cherry Cola The story behind the cherry cola Oreo is a bit more straightforward: Oreo die-hards were presented with three fan-suggested finalists earlier this year and were asked to vote on their favorite flavor. Et voila! We've now been graced with these. They taste like if you bottled up your childhood summers and spread them across two chocolate cookie sandwiches, BTW. Wasabi Yes. You read that right. Also introduced earlier this year (to the Chinese Oreo market) were these WASABI OREOS. And-wait for it-they were rolled out alongside...... Hot Chicken Wing Yes. You ALSO read that right. :) :) :) :))))))) Firework OK. You can breathe now. We're back in the realm of semi-normal-ish Oreo flavors. This particular cookie quite literally pops in your mouth, as it features popping candy. Waffles & Syrup Sure, these were a limited-time-only Albertson's exclusive , but at ome point in time, we lived in a world where Waffles & Syrup-flavored Oreos existed. Have you ever heard a better excuse for having cookies for breakfast? Blueberry Pie Veering away from the classic outer cookies are these graham crackers ones. They give way to a blueberry creme filling . Delightful all around. Fruity Crisp This magical flavor also featured those graham cracker cookies, but this time, the creme filling was uber-flecked with-you guessed it-those "fruity crisps" that you grew up loving. Blueberry Ice Cream No, they're not the same as blueberry pie Oreos. Don't you see how we're back to chocolate cookies now?? Mickey's 90th Birthday More specifically, these are birthday cake-flavored Oreos in celebration of Mickey Mouse's forthcoming 90th birthday , but does it really matter? They are crazy. They are delicious . Seriously-think Dunkaroos meets........Oreos. Rainbow "Shure, Bert!" This 2013 limited-release flavor featured golden Oreo cookies with lime and raspberry sherbet flavors stuffed in between. Daaaamn. Candy Cane How could I leave you on any other note?
AA4Tc3G	autos	autosreview	2014 Hyundai Accent SE First Test	The 2014 Hyundai Accent strikes a good balance, separating itself from others with its handsome styling and strong performance.	The standout cars of the subcompact segment are those that offer the least amount of compromise for an affordable price. The 2014 Hyundai Accent strikes a good balance, separating itself from others with its handsome styling and strong performance. Sharing the same platform, engine, and transmission with the Kia Rio, the Accent is powered by a 1.6-liter I-4 producing 138 hp, providing more-than-adequate power to motivate its relatively featherweight 2579 pounds. The Accent achieves 0-60 mph in 9.0 seconds, onto a quarter-mile time of 16.8 seconds at 82.8 mph, putting it at the middle of the pack, behind the Chevrolet Sonic and the last-generation Honda Fit, but ahead of the Toyota Yaris and the Nissan Versa Note. Normal stoplight-to-stoplight acceleration under 40 mph is more-than adequate, as the 1.6-liter punches above its power rating. Highway entrance ramps and freeway passing are not things to fear, but the necessary burying-of-the-throttle results in a rather uneconomical outcome. The six-speed automatic transmission is the best part of the drivetrain. Shifts are smooth, unnoticeable, and when you need them to be, quick. After initial acceleration onto the highway, the sixth gear does its job to settle the car down, transitioning the car to a low-rpm cruise ( the 2012-2014 Hyundai Elantra is shown in this First Test ). Steering is light and a bit muted, not transmitting much from the road in favor of ease and comfort. Handling is neutral, the Accent favors good road manners and refinement over sporting pretensions. The Accent is no canyon carver, but it's not supposed to be. The Accent took a respectable 28.0 seconds to lap our figure-eight course, at an average of 0.60 g, placing the Accent above the last-gen Fit, Yaris, and Versa Note in the average g category, but below the Chevrolet Sonic, and Kia Rio in the overall figure-eight time. The Accent is capable of an EPA-rated 27/37 mpg city/highway, for a combined 31 mpg. It rates in the middle of the subcompact group, coming in behind the CVT-equipped 2014 Nissan Versa Note with a combined 35 mpg, the 2015 Honda Fit at 35-36 mpg, and the 2014 Toyota Yaris at 32 mpg, but comes in ahead of the 2014 Chevrolet Sonic with a 1.8-liter I-4 at 28 mpg, though with a 1.4-liter turbo I-4 the rating matches that of the Accent. Inside, our Accent SE test car had a leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel, while the bezel surrounding the control stack is finished in glossy black. The gauges are particularly attractive, and deceptively premium in appearance, backlit with Hyundai's signature blue lighting. Seats are a little on the flat and unsupportive side, but can be forgiven for the impressive amount of rear-seat legroom and space available in the cargo area. Capacity with the rear seats in place is 21.2 cubic feet, but lay the rear seats flat, and usable space expands to 47.5 cubic feet. The Accent is not a cargo wizard like the Honda Fit, but the hatchback provides plenty of space for luggage-hauling and grocery runs. An exceptionally intuitive optional Bluetooth hands-free system mated to a six-speaker audio system provides quality sound, and connecting a phone or iPod is as simple as plugging into the easily accessible USB port or connecting via Bluetooth. For 2014, Hyundai upgraded the Accent with new standard and optional equipment. The Accent receives a one-touch triple turn signal, sliding sun visors, and a driver's blind spot-mirror. The standard audio system is updated for improved voice recognition and sound quality. Hyundai incorporated new projector headlights with LED accents, welcome lamps, driver's side auto-up window and tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel added to SE hatchback and Premium Package sedan models. The Accent is Hyundai's attempt to create a refined subcompact that provides the same sense of solidity as the rest of the automaker's contemporary lineup. With a blend of high-quality interior components for its class, a solid drivetrain, strong performance, and sharp styling, the Accent is a decent choice for the average subcompact consumer. 2014 Hyundai Accent SE Four-Door Hatch BASE PRICE $18,205 PRICE AS TESTED $18,315 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front-engine, FWD, 5-pass, 4-door hatchback ENGINE 1.6L/138-hp/123-lb-ft DOHC 16-valve I-4 TRANSMISSION 6-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 2579 lb (62/38%) WHEELBASE 101.2 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 162.0 x 66.9 x 57.1 in 0-60 MPH 9.0 sec QUARTER MILE 16.8 sec @ 82.8 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 116 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.80 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 28.0 sec @ 0.60 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY/COMB FUEL ECON 27/37/31 mpg ENERGY CONS., CITY/HWY 125/91 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS 0.63 lb/mile

Follow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter ACURA ILX Base Price: $29,000* Body Type: Sedan Unchanged: Acura's smallest sedan, based on the old Honda Civic platform, will likely soldier on unchanged before it's redesigned or discontinued. It could receive a new exterior look as part of its refresh to put it in line with the rest of Acura's lineup. A fresh multimedia system is also possible. But don't expect anything new under the hood; the ILX will likely keep the same powertrain for the rest of the current model's life cycle.

With 573 hp and 476 lb-ft, Acura's hybrid supercar offers strong acceleration and unflappable handling thanks to torque vectoring from its front electric motors. The NSX's drive mode selector includes a Quiet mode, which lets the car operate electrically so you can pull out of your driveway without startling the whole neighborhood.

Last year, a 10-speed automatic replaced the six-speed as the sole gearbox option with the base 3.5-liter V-6. The Sport Hybrid model will remain the only grade with all-wheel drive and is available only as a single, loaded trim. No word on whether the RLX will get the updated multimedia system found in the refreshed MDX and TLX.

In a test last year, the updated nine-speed automatic felt better behaved than in prior model years. The TLX V-6 with the Technology and Advance packages also gets new 19-inch wheels.

New stand-alone options include a microfiber steering wheel, race-tuned suspension, and carbon-fiber side mirror covers. With the two-seater not mentioned in FCA's five-year plan presented in June, don't expect it to see another generation, especially with Alfa planning to revive the 8C and GTV.

An AMG V-8 comes standard, and the V-12-powered coupe has been updated for 2019. Now called the DB11 AMR, it gets 30 more horsepower, a retuned transmission, sportier handling, and a more vocal exhaust in Sport mode. The drop-top Volante doesn't get a V-12 option.

As the name suggests, the DBS Superleggera is lighter than the DB11 it's based on and makes significantly more power. Styling changes to the front and rear give the Superleggera a more conventional Aston Martin look not seen on the DB11 or Vantage. A drop-top Volante model will also be offered.

A new AMR model gets a retuned suspension, 21-inch wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, and a 205-mph top speed. At some point next year, the fully electric RapidE will go on sale, potentially making more than 800 hp. Only 155 will be built.

Instead of styling it like a smaller DB11, designers gave the Vantage a DB10 concept-inspired look. An AMG-sourced V-8 is the only engine option for now, but the Vantage makes up for its lack of a V-12 with responsive handling and a great exhaust note. It's world-class quick, hitting 60 mph in an estimated 3.5 seconds.

The base engine is shared with the front-drive A4 Ultra, the more powerful version reserved for all-wheel-drive models. Automatic emergency braking, a panoramic sunroof, and heated leather seats are standard. A convertible , a plug-in hybrid hatchback , and two performance versions are available.

The A4 offers a balance of handling and ride quality, as well as a refined interior. An impressive suite of technology and active safety features is also available. Buyers looking to save money will appreciate the relatively affordable A4 Ultra model, but enthusiasts will be drawn to the sportier 354-hp S4.

In place of the previous V-8, the 2019 RS 5 uses a 444-hp twin-turbo V-6. Thank to a quick-shifting transmission and rear-biased all-wheel drive, both RS 5s should easily hit 60 mph in less than 4.0 seconds. Even without the RS 5's powerful engine, A5 and S5 models pair good looks with well-designed interiors and desirable technology.

The center console features a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system above an 8.6-inch secondary touchscreen. A 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster is offered, as are a number of driver-assist features. Expect the sportier S6 and a turbo-four model in late 2019. Also Consider: BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Volvo S90 Sum Up: A stylish luxury sedan packed with technology Research the Audi A6 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi A6 near you AUDI A7 Base Price: $72,000-$84,000* Body Type: Hatchback Major: Like its four-door A6 sibling, the fast-roofed A7 is redesigned for 2019. Its cabin is almost identical to the A6's, with the same layout, premium materials, and tech options. The coupelike styling, rear hatch, and rear cargo room differentiate it from the A6 and other midsize luxury sedans. Expect the S7 to be announced soon, with an even more powerful RS version likely following in a couple of years. Also Consider: BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, Porsche Panamera Sum Up: A sportier, more practical A6 Research the Audi A7 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi A7 near you AUDI A8 Base Price: $86,000-$110,000* Body Type: Sedan Major: Audi swung for the fences with this redesign. The flagship A8 got a new look and updated powertrains, plus a ton of high-tech luxury features, including Traffic Jam Pilot, a semi-autonomous driver-assistance system too advanced for U.S. laws. A heated, massaging footrest is also available for the right rear passenger to use in conjunction with a pillowy headrest and reclining, massage seat. Also Consider: BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS, Mercedes-Benz S-Class Sum Up: A luxury flagship that may soon be its own chauffeur Research the Audi A8 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi A8 near you AUDI R8 Base Price: $141,500-$197,000* Body Type: Coupe, conv Minor: Earlier this year, Audi introduced a limited edition rear-drive version of the R8 called the RWS. Not only is the R8 RWS lighter and more tail-happy than the regular car, but it's also less expensive. Expect an entry-level V-6 version with well over 400 hp and a track-focused R8 GT to join the lineup soon. Those models will likely arrive in the U.S. as 2020 models and could coincide with a midcycle refresh. Also Consider: Acura NSX, Aston Martin Vantage, McLaren 570 Sum Up: A supercar you can drive daily Research the Audi R8 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi R8 near you AUDI TT Base Price: $45,000-$66,000* Body Type: Coupe, conv Unchanged: Following last year's introduction of the 400-hp TT RS, Audi's smallest sports car should get a face-lift next year. Expect both ends to receive A7-inspired styling changes, with the interior likely getting a few updates, as well. There's also a chance the base engine will get a bump up to 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque, matching its output in a different application. Additional changes should be minor. Also Consider: BMW Z4, Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, Porsche 718 Sum Up: A sporty but practical coupe or roadster Research the Audi TTS Coupe or TT Roadster on MSN Autos | Find an Audi TT near you BENTLEY CONTINENTAL GT Base Price: $205,000-$241,500* Body Type: Coupe, conv* Major: The latest-generation Bentley Continental GT shares a platform with the current Porsche Panamera, as well as a modified version of Porsche's PDK eight-speed twin-clutch automatic gearbox. Lavishly appointed, the four-seat coupe will be the first to go on sale, likely soon followed by the convertible variant. Expect a twin-turbo V-8 to join the engine lineup, and possibly a plug-in hybrid variant. Also Consider Aston Martin DB11, Rolls-Royce Wraith, Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe Sum Up: The quintessential British grand tourer, now with a slight German accent Research the Bentley Continental GT on MSN Autos | Find a Bentley Continental GT near you BENTLEY FLYING SPUR Base Price: $193,000-$250,000* Body Type: Sedan Unchanged: Last year the Flying Spur gained a V8 S Black Edition model, with 21-inch black alloy wheels, accented headlights and taillights, and contrast cabin stitching.

Apparently, no one told McLaren the 720S is one of the quickest cars we've ever tested. It will hold its own against the 918 Spyder in the quarter mile, and it set a production car lap record at Willow Springs' big track. For less than $300,000, that's incredible.

Nissan has no plans to stop selling its decade-old sports car even though few would be surprised if it did. Following last year's minor face-lift, the 2019 model gets two new colors, a standard auto-dimming rearview mirror, and some minor shuffling of the options packages.

For the first time in the U.S., all-wheel drive is available on all versions equipped with the base engine. The V-6 has also been dropped in favor of Nissan's ultra-advanced turbo-four. The new engine, available only on front-drive models, can vary its compression ratio to improve power or fuel economy depending on the situation. Nissan's extra comfy Zero Gravity seats are standard.

Nissan has steadily updated and improved its supercar killer in that time, and with those improvements has come a higher price tag. Late last year, Nissan partially reversed that trend with a $10,000 drop in base price. A few updates from the new NISMO GT3 race car could trickle down to the regular GT-R, but don't expect a redesigned model to arrive any time soon.

The new motor makes 40 hp and 49 lb-ft more than it did before, and the car offers better features and a more refined driving experience. The Leaf's 151-mile range is 40 percent better than the previous version. For 2019, Nissan plans to add a long-range battery option that will go about 225 miles on a charge.

Expect the restyled fascia to be influenced by the look of the new Altima, with the rear getting updated taillights and a sporty quad exhaust. Inside, the Maxima should get Nissan's latest active driver aids and an updated infotainment system. There's also a chance the VC-Turbo four-cylinder might replace the V-6.

It doesn't look like that will happen for 2019, though. Still, the existing model's cabin is more spacious than the exterior would suggest, and the Sentra's low base price makes it more affordable than many of its competitors.

For 2019, the previously optional sports exhaust is standard. We also expect Porsche to bring back the Boxster Spyder and Cayman GT4. Power will likely come from a detuned version of the 911 GT3's naturally aspirated flat-six, not the turbo-four used in other Boxster and Cayman models.

It's less powerful than the turbocharged GT2 RS but is the most powerful naturally aspirated car Porsche has ever sold. That means there are now 24 variants of the 911.

Don't expect many changes for 2019, though. There are numerous available powertrains, and buyers looking for additional legroom will like the Panamera Executive's stretched wheelbase.

Changes will be minimal for 2019. The driving range is rated at 57 to 58 miles on a full charge, and charging a depleted battery takes three hours using a Level 2 charger.

BBH9KRa	autos	autosluxury	2018 Lexus LS: What You Need to Know	The Lexus LS is redesigned for the 2018 model year, but it still finishes in the bottom half of our super luxury car rankings.	The Lexus LS is redesigned for the 2018 model year, but it still finishes in the bottom half of our super luxury car rankings . The Lexus looks good at a high level, but there are some nits worth picking that are enough to knock it down a few pegs in this expectation-filled class. The 2018 Lexus LS is ranked: #4 in Super Luxury Cars Is the Lexus LS a Good Car? Yes, the Lexus LS is a good car. (After all, the worst super luxury car is still better than the best car in many other classes.) Still, the LS brings a lot to the table. It moves well thanks to a powerful engine and solid handling. It's well-built and looks great inside. There are lots of standard and available tech features, and there are plenty of seating upgrades for both rows of seats. However, the LS has a frustrating infotainment system that lacks smartphone connectivity technology, which you can get even in nonluxury vehicles. Should I Buy the Lexus LS? The LS is certainly a good value in this class, as it's a great car that costs less than a lot of other super luxury cars. That said, if you're going to shell out the money for one of the premium vehicles in this class, you might as well make sure you're getting one of the best options. Even though it costs more, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class makes a better choice for a super luxury car. You may also want to consider the Lexus GS, which is a luxury midsize car. It's smaller than the LS and lacks some of the LS' bells and whistles, but it's a nice car and costs way less. Should I Buy a New or Used Lexus LS? The Lexus LS is fully redesigned for 2018. It offers revamped styling inside and out, along with a host of other changes. The LS' brand-new platform aims to improve handling and driving dynamics, while also increasing space. It has 3.4 more inches of rear legroom than the outgoing model, and the trunk size increases from 13.9 to 16.9 cubic feet. Several driver assistance and advanced safety features are available for the first time, including a head-up display, pedestrian alert, side collision warning, front cross traffic alert, reverse automatic braking, traffic sign recognition, active steering assist, lane trace assist, and a surround-view camera. Lexus gives the LS an all-new powertrain: a twin-turbocharged V6 that puts out 416 horsepower and returns an estimated 19/30 mpg city/highway. This setup beats out the 2017 model's 386-horsepower 4.6-liter V8, which gets 16/24 mpg city/highway. Also new for 2018 is the Lexus LS 500h hybrid. It's likely that you can save money by shopping for a used 2017 or older LS. If you're considering an older model, be sure to read our reviews of the 2017 Lexus LS and 2016 Lexus LS. If you decide an older model is right for you, check out our Used Car Deals page to learn about savings and discounts on used vehicles. We don't base our car reviews on our personal opinions. Instead, we combine the findings of professional test drivers with data such as reliability ratings and safety scores to give you a complete overview of every vehicle we rank. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News & World Report has been ranking the best cars, trucks, and SUVs for 10 years, and our staff has more than 75 years' worth of auto industry experience combined. To keep our reviews unbiased, we don't accept expensive gifts or trips from car companies, and an outside company manages our advertising. How Much Does the Lexus LS Cost? Lexus hasn't yet released official pricing data for the redesigned 2018 LS, but the company claims it will have a base price of around $75,000. While that's an increase over the previous LS generation, it's still one of the lowest starting prices in the super luxury car class. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Lexus dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Lexus deals page. Lexus LS Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Lexus LS or Mercedes-Benz S-class? Asking any car to measure up to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class is a tall order. The S-Class is Mercedes' flagship sedan, and as you might expect, no expense is spared. The S-Class delivers nearly unparalleled levels of interior luxury and has roughly infinite standard and available features. If that weren't enough, the S-Class has a lineup of powerful engines, handles capably, and provides an incredibly supple ride. While the LS is a fine vehicle, it's just not in the S-Class' league. Which is Better: Lexus LS or Lexus GS? The main differences between the LS and the Lexus GS are driving dynamics and price. The LS is a big, opulent cruiser. It envelops you in a serene, silent cabin covered in high-quality materials. The GS is no slouch when it comes to interior design, but its cabin materials aren't quite as rich as those in the LS. However, it's worth noting that the GS costs tens of thousands of dollars less than the LS. The GS is more of a sports sedan designed to give you some behind-the-wheel thrills. The LS is a cruiser made to get you to your destination in opulence. One type of driving dynamic is not necessarily better than the other   the choice has more to do with your personal preferences. Both the Lexus LS and Lexus GS are great cars, but they are designed for two different types of drivers. A test drive can help determine which is a better fit for you. LS Interior How Many People Does the LS Seat? The Lexus LS seats five people, and there are numerous available seating upgrades. Both rows have plenty of space, but class rivals offer more room up front and in the back. LS and Car Seats There are two full sets of LATCH car-seat connectors in the LS. They're located in the rear outboard seats. LS Interior Quality You won't be disappointed by this car's interior. There are premium materials throughout, and the cabin looks great. Lexus didn't overlook small details, and the interior gives off a distinctive feel. LS Cargo Space The LS has 16.9 cubic feet of trunk space, and the LS Hybrid has 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space. In either model, you'll have room for roughly a dozen shopping bags. You'll also have plenty of space for a weekend's worth of luggage. LS Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation Standard features in the LS include push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10-speaker audio system, satellite radio, HD Radio, Bluetooth, a USB port, a moonroof, and an infotainment system with a 12.3-inch screen, navigation, and the Remote Touch Interface, which responds to smartphone-style inputs and includes handwriting recognition. Available features include quad-zone automatic climate control, a 23-speaker Mark Levinson audio system, the Lexus Enform Remote (which lets you start the car, lock and unlock the doors, and control climate settings from your phone), a Wi-Fi hot spot, and a 7-inch touch screen in the rear seat. Though you'd expect a super luxury car to offer everything you can think of, the LS isn't available with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto   two connectivity features that are increasingly common even in nonluxury vehicles. (For more information, read What Is Apple CarPlay? and What Is Android Auto? Then, see the Best Cars With Apple CarPlay and Best Cars With Android Auto.) The infotainment system is complex as well, and the touchpad controller is more cumbersome to use than a touch screen. LS Performance LS Engine: Hybrid or Not? The LS has one gasoline-only powertrain and one hybrid powertrain. The gasoline-only LS 500 and LS 500 F Sport feature a 416-horsepower, twin-turbo V6 engine. The LS 500h hybrid features a V6 and two electric motors that produce a combined 354 horsepower. Both setups are paired with 10-speed automatic transmissions. With either powertrain, you'll have plenty of power to move this big sedan without any trouble. The 500 and 500 F Sport have slightly better acceleration than the 500h, but the hybrid setup won't hold you back in any driving situation. LS Gas Mileage: Nothing to Sneeze At The LS 500 gets typical fuel economy ratings for the class, earning 19 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. For comparison, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class earns 19/28 mpg city/highway. The LS 500h gets better mileage than other super luxury cars, earning 25/33 mpg city/highway. LS Ride and Handling: Not Sporty, but Capable Though this isn't the most athletic car in the class, the LS holds its own when the roads get curvy. Its steering is sharp, and it handles turns well. It also rides smoothly, which is to be expected with a luxury car. LS Reliability Is the Lexus LS Reliable? The 2018 Lexus LS doesn't yet have a predicted reliability rating from J.D. Power. Lexus LS Warranty The Lexus LS is covered by a four-year/50,000-mile warranty and a six-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. Most class rivals have similar warranty terms. LS Safety LS Crash Test Results The 2018 Lexus LS hasn't yet been put through crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. LS Safety Features Standard driver assistance features include a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, pedestrian detection, and forward collision warning. Available active safety features include a 24-inch head-up display, pedestrian alert (which can detect the direction a pedestrian is walking), side collision warning, front and rear cross traffic alert, reverse automatic braking, traffic sign recognition, active steering assist (which automatically controls steering and braking in some situations), lane trace assist (which "traces" the path of the vehicle ahead of you in case there aren't road lines), and a surround-view camera. Which Lexus LS Model is Right for Me? Lexus has yet to release a lot of information about the LS sedan, which will be available for purchase in early 2018. However, we do know it will be offered in three trims: the base LS 500, the LS 500 F Sport, and the LS 500h (the hybrid). Pricing estimates have not yet been released, but Lexus claims the LS 500's starting price will be around $75,000. The LS 500 F Sport and LS 500h are predicted to start at about $5,000 to $10,000 higher than that. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Lexus dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Lexus deals page. The Final Call The redesigned 2018 Lexus LS offers solid performance and a beautiful, feature-laden interior. However, it's held back by some pretty glaring errors, at least by the absurdly lofty standards of this class. That's why the Lexus finishes in the bottom third of our class rankings   and why there are probably better buying choices among super luxury cars. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis. Read the full 2018 Lexus LS review on U.S. News & World Report for more details, photos, specs and prices.

So it should be no surprise that, when it's not working correctly, a ton of issues will follow. Here are 20 warning signs to keep an eye out for.	Your liver is one of the largest and most important organs in your body. So it should be no surprise that, when it's not working correctly, a ton of issues will follow. Here are 20 warning signs to keep an eye out for. 20 Warning Signs Your Liver Sends You Your liver does a lot for your health. As one of the body's largest organs, it's responsible for metabolic functions like converting nutrients from your diet so your body can use them, and making sure toxic substances are flushed out before they cause any harm. When your liver is in trouble, though, there are a handful of ways it lets you know and here are 20 warning signs to watch out for. And, liver problems commonly stem from excess alcohol consumption, you may want to consider taking our test to see if your boozing habits are healthy or not . 1. You Have Super-Itchy Skin Primary biliary cholangitis   a chronic disease that destroys the bile ducts in your liver   doesn't typically have super-noticeable symptoms, but one early sign is experiencing itchy skin. Sure, your skin might just be dry, but if it's becoming a regular thing, it might be worth getting checked out   especially because itchy skin is also an indicator of cirrhosis of the liver. And for more about skin symptoms, check out these 20 Skin Symptoms That Indicate More Serious Health Issues . 2. Your Skin or Eyes Are Turning Yellow Seeing the whites of your eyes start to turn yellow   or experiencing yellowing of your skin   can be incredibly scary, but it has a solid explanation: called jaundice, it's due to a high level of bilirubin in the body , which is a yellow-ish pigment that's secreted by the liver. If you do notice the discoloration, it could be from many different liver issues, from cirrhosis to hepatitis B . And for more reasons your skin may be deteriorating, bone up on the 20 Reasons Your Thyroid Is More Important Than You Imagined . 3. You've Gained a Lot of Weight If you're suddenly gaining weight out of nowhere, your liver might be to blame. It could be a sign you have liver cirrhosis, a disease that develops slowly and replaces healthy liver tissue with scar tissue, blocking blood flow through the liver and inhibiting the organ from working properly. For more weight loss inspiration, check out 50 Genius Weight-Loss Motivation Tricks . 4. You're Losing Weight While suddenly gaining weight can be a warning sign from your liver, losing weight can be a symptom, too. Seeing the number drop on the scale isn't just a sign of liver cirrhosis   it's also a red flag of hepatitis C , a viral infection that leads to the inflammation of the liver. And for more great health advice, learn the 20 Best Ways to Have A Healthy Thyroid . 5. Your Palms Are Red Speaking of red flags, do you suddenly have red palms for no reason? It could be due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , a condition that involves too much fat being stored in liver cells that affects people who barely drink   or totally avoid!   alcohol. 6. Your Sleep Schedule Is Out of Whack There are many things that can disturb your sleep pattern, but a 2012 study published in the Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis found one possible culprit is liver cirrhosis, which can make it especially hard to get a good night's rest   even if you're counting sleep like it's your job. If it turns out your liver's fine and you're still having trouble nodding off, you may want to check out The 10 Best Pillows For A Better Night's Sleep . 7. Your Memory Has Gotten Worse Forgetting where you left your car keys is one thing, but if your memory has gotten much worse lately, there might be a reason for that. When you're experiencing liver failure, your organ can't properly remove toxins from the blood, and that can result in them building up in the brain   aka hepatic encephalopathy . Unfortunately, one of the results of that is memory loss. To help counteract this, master the 10 Ways to Develop a Photographic Memory . 8. You're Always Tired Feeling really tired lately, no matter what you do? Liver disease might be to blame. One incredibly common symptom is chronic fatigue, which according to a 2006 study published in the Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, could occur due to changes in neurotransmission within the brain. If you find yourself regularly exhausted at all time, learn the 50 Ways to Be A Higher-Energy Person Immediately . 9. Your Appetite Has Disappeared You used to chow down like you were in a food competition, and now you're never hungry. So what gives? Another common symptom of liver disease is a loss of appetite, making your non-existent hunger pangs something to be weary of. 10. You're a Man Experiencing Enlarged Breasts One of the most shocking warning signs of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is experiencing enlarged breasts if you're a man. It's a very mind-boggling occurrence, but there's an explanation: it's thought that the growth of excess breast tissue   aka gynecomastia   occurs due to an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. And for more on preventative care, bone up on The 15 Most Common Types of Cancer . 11. Your Personality Is Changing Experiencing changes to your personality can be scary   and sometimes it might be others that notice before you do. Just like how hepatic encephalopathy can cause memory loss, all those toxins building up in your brain can also decrease mental function , causing you to not act like yourself. 12. You Bruise Really Easily As you get older, your body can start to bruise more easily due to your skin getting thinner. If there's really no explanation for why more marks are showing up on your body, though (meaning you're relatively young), it might be a good idea to look into liver disease, which can also make it a more frequent occurrence. 13. You Have Swollen Legs and Ankles Liver disease can be caused by everything from alcohol use to obesity, and one common warning sign is something you probably wouldn't expect: swelling in your legs and ankles. If you're experiencing the puffiness and aren't sure why, a visit to your doc might be in order to make sure it's not something serious. 14. You Feel Confused Unfortunately, the hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver failure can also mess with your ability to understand things. This can result in you feeling confused about things that wouldn't normally confuse you. 15. You're Having Body Pains You haven't been working out more than usual, so what gives with all your body pain? One possible reason is primary biliary cholangitis, which aside from causing itchy skin can also lead to bone, muscle, or joint pain. 16. You Feel Really Bloated If your bloating can't be blamed on a big meal, it might be due to the buildup of fluid in the abdomen, which is known as ascites . Since abdominal swelling is a warning sign of liver disease, it's a good idea to make a doctor's appointment, just in case. 17. Your Urine Is Dark Seeing dark urine in the toilet after going to the bathroom can be a total shocker   and it's also a tell-tail sign of liver disease. While bilirubin is responsible for the yellowing of the eyes or skin, it can also change the color or your pee due to being excreted through the kidneys. 18. You Can't Concentrate Let's be real   everyone has dealt with concentration issues. Sometimes your brain just doesn't want to work. If you feel like you're having trouble concentrating regularly, though, that could also be your liver giving you a warning sign that it's failing . 19. You Have the Chills, All the Time Have a chronic case of the chills that no amount of cozy blankets can fix? It could be a sign of cholestasis during liver disease, which occurs when the organ's flow of bile is reduced or has stopped completely. And for more great health advice, learn The 100 Ways to Live to 100 . 20. You Have Dry Eyes or a Dry Mouth There are plenty of different reasons behind experiencing dry eyes or a dry mouth   from your age to the medications you're taking   but one possible culprit is a lot more serious. Primary biliary cholangitis is known to cause the problem, but luckily it's an early symptom of the chronic disease.

AA3gfvH	autos	autosnews	2007 Volvo S80 Road Test	There's one element of Volvo's image it doesn't like to broadcast: The brand is a key icon of the stereotypical liberal. But,Volvo wants to sell the all-new 2007 S80 to conservatives, too. Read this full Road Test article at Motor Trend	There's one element of Volvo's image it doesn't like to broadcast: The brand is a key icon of the stereotypical liberal--or, as University of California, Berkeley linguist Geoffrey Nunberg describes the demographic, the "latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show." Volvo wants to sell the all-new 2007 S80 to conservatives, too. While the new Volvo flagship's design whispers its luxury in an egalitarian way, any devotee of modern Scandinavian elegance, conservative or liberal, will like the S80. An optional Yamaha V-8 will allow bourbon-drinking, red-meat eating, Wall Street Journal-reading, Marine haircut-wearing, Crawford, Texas-loving right-wing freaks to drive it stealthily and be admired for owning a safe, virtuous car even as fuel supplies tighten. The S80 has lost the Swedish Buick look of the 1999-2006 model. The new design looks like a grownup S60, slightly stretched with more chrome. The C-pillar is faster, and its unity of design makes the old car look awkward. Only the rear view is a bit unresolved, where a thin horizontal chrome strip bridges the taillamps to keep the back end from looking too chunky. The new S80 is taller and you sit fairly high in the driver's seat, yet there's ample headroom, even with a sunroof. It has roughly the same overall length as the outgoing model, but with a longer wheelbase, wider stance, and aforementioned taller overall height. It also has a new, stiffer body structure and an L-shaped front suspension link attachment for more wheel movement. An active three-mode suspension (comfort, sport, and advanced) based on Volvo's Four-C technology uses sensors to adjust the suspension to road conditions. With that rakish C-pillar, the rear seat looks like it should be cramped. But the car has loads of rear leg- and headroom, courtesy in part to a fairly low seat cushion that'll have a six-footer sitting with his knees bent upward. Colors, material, and fit and finish are all of high, harmonious quality. There's optional perforated-leather heated and cooled front seats, a superb optional 130-watt Alpine digital amp with Dolby Pro Logic II Surround and 12 Dynaudio loudspeakers (40-watt amplifier and eight speakers standard). There's the "2001: A Space Odyssey" monolith navigation screen, rising from the middle of the front-center Dynaudio speaker via a wireless remote control. Volvo has redesigned the radio controls so that the right knob changes radio stations, no longer serving as source control. There's also an MP3 player input inside the console box. Volvo's optional Personal Car Communicator tells you whether you've locked the doors and whether they were locked when you come back to the car, and uses a heartbeat sensor inside the car to tell you if there's a human you might not know hiding there. Has someone at Volvo has been renting slasher thrillers from Netflix? Trigger the pushbutton starter with the key in your pocket or slide the key into a handy slot next to the button. It's one of the better pushbutton starters extant. There are no iDrive-style contraptions or overengineered solutions to newly discovered problems. Volvo says engineers went out of their way to provide only user-friendly technology. Designers combined this with an interior that looks inviting, not ostentatious. It has the "flying bridge" center console first seen in the S40, supple leathers, and a choice of two shades of real wood trim or etched aluminum trim, which at presstime Volvo was deciding whether to import to the U.S. Tell 'em you want it. Two new gee-whiz safety technologies get mixed reviews. The BLIS blind-spot warning system works much better than Audi's, which in the Q7 uses big, yellow light strips inside the sideview mirrors to warn you of a car in your left or right blind spot. The S80 has smaller amber lights under the A-pillars' audio speakers for gentler notice. Volvo saves its alarmism for a big red light on the dash above the front cowl. Using the adaptive cruise control to determine if you're approaching a solid object too quickly without decelerating, it buzzes and flashes abruptly (without taking control of throttle or brake). But like adaptive cruise, it has trouble distinguishing objects off-center or at a right angle, so a car that had pulled off the road at an S-turn in our Southwestern Swedish drive and a farm tractor that made a quick left turn into a driveway caused it to buzz. You can switch it off. These options are available whether you choose the brand-new 3.2-liter inline-six or the Yamaha 4.4-liter 60-degree V-8 from the XC90, offered for the first time in a Volvo sedan. The transmission with either engine is a smooth, new six-speed unit, with a gearshift-operated manumatic control (but no paddle shifters, we're happy to say; no one should get into this car and pretend he's Fernando Alonso). Manually shifting the six gears is satisfying, and the tranny won't upshift for you until you exceed the redline. Europe gets an optional six-speed manual with any of three engines, which includes an updated version of Volvo's 2.4-liter inline-five turbodiesel, with particulate trap, rated 185 horsepower and 295 pound-feet. The V-8 comes with the XC90's all-wheel-drive system standard. AWD isn't available with the front-drive six, although Volvo may offer it with a different six in the future. With AWD, 95 percent of torque goes to the front wheels under normal conditions, but most of that torque is shifted to the rear wheels on demand. Under full-throttle standing starts, there's enough rear squat and torque-shift lag to feel torque steer when going for the zip-to-60. Once it settles, the car clicks smoothly through the six gears and provides satisfying grunt, although the engine noise is high and whiny for a V-8. The six is less quick, of course, but most S80 buyers will be happy with this smooth, torquey new engine. The S80 had excessive road noise for a luxury car. Volvo says it plans to work on the bushings to solve the problem up to its summer introduction in Europe (we have to wait until next February). Handling is predictable, and optional speed-sensitive steering, in which boost disappears at high speeds, has a light, precise touch with excellent feedback. It's a great improvement over the old S80's numb steering. You'll have a good sense of the road conditions, and you'll be able to find optimum safe speeds on wet, slippery surfaces. Most will prefer the "advanced" setting on the three-mode system, even when it gets firm on chattery roads with the V-8 sport package's 18-inch wheels. Body roll is moderate in corners, but without much understeer. It's not trying to be a BMW, but the S80 feels more tossable and light on its feet than a non-AMG Mercedes. More to the point of its direct competitors, the Volvo feels more involving than an Acura RL, but it doesn't command the road as an Audi A6 does. It's a ride-handling combo that seems right for the modern Scandinavian-furniture feel of the interior. Coming from a brand with its stereotype, the S80 achieves a great deal of balance. It's a sedan with a comfortable, elegant, but not ostentatious interior and a clean, almost plain exterior that belies its prestigious intentions. That kind of image should go over well with modern thinkers from the right and the left. 2007 Volvo S80 Base price $38,000-$49,000 (est) Vehicle layout Front engine, FWD (I-6) or AWD (V-8), 5-pass, 4-door, sedan Engines 3.2L/235-hp/236 lb-ft DOHC 24-valve I-6; 4.4L/311-hp/325 lb-ft DOHC 32-valve V-8 Transmission 6-speed automatic Curb weight, F/R DIST 3500-3850 (mfr) Wheelbase 112.0 in Length x width x height 191.0 x 73.0 x 59.0 in 0-62 mph 6-5-8.0 sec (mfr est) EPA CITY/HWY FUEL ECON Not yet rated On Sale In The U.S. February 2007 S80 = MKS Can Volvo do for Lincoln what Mercedes-Benz did for Chrysler? Just as the 300 and Dodge variants use the last-generation E-Class platform, the outgoing S80's platform (which continues in the S60, V70, and XC90) has evolved into the D3 architecture underneath the Ford Five Hundred/Freestyle, Mercury Montego, and now, the 2008 Lincoln MKS. But while Ford was eager to point out the Volvo connection to the Fords and Mercury, especially in issues of safety, it's low-key about that connection in the 2008 Lincoln MKS, which replaces the outgoing LS. The Volvo platform is flexible--it serves the smaller S60, the V70, and XC90--and like the Fords and Mercury is stretched to 203.8 inches overall in the MKS, with a 114.4-inch wheelbase. As shown in concept, the Lincoln has 20-inch wheels, all-wheel drive, the Yamaha V-8, and six-speed automatic. A base front-drive model with the new Volvo 3.2-liter six would be a good way to amortize that powertrain. For the 2010 model year, Lincoln will stretch the platform further for its new "modern flagship," a front- or all-wheel-drive sedan codenamed E386. Lincoln is expected to sell it without dropping its venerable Town Car. Meanwhile, the new S80 platform will be the basis for a big 2008 wagon and possibly a hybrid-powered 2010 sedan.
BBH6sqU	autos	autosnews	End of the Road: Marking the Passing of the Australian Auto Industry - The Big Picture	The death of an auto industry	A moment's silence, please, to mark the passing of the Australian auto industry. The last car to be designed, engineered, and manufactured in Australia, a Holden Commodore SS-V Redline sedan, rolled off the General Motors Holden assembly line in October. The end of the road arrived 69 years after another Holden, the hunchbacked 48/215, proudly announced the birth of "Australia's Own Car." Officially, GM's decision to quit making cars in Australia which followed similar exits by Ford and Toyota  was the result of the Australian government ending financial support for auto manufacturing. But that's not the whole story: Australians had also fallen out of love with the Australian car. From 1998 through 2003, GMH sold an average of almost 88,000 Holden Commodores a year. By 2010, however, Commodore sales had slumped to less than 47,000 a year and by 2016 less than 26,000. Based on a 1940 design for a small Chevy that was never built, the first Holden launched in November 1948 was a tough, roomy sedan with space for five and their luggage, powered by a torquey, easy-driving engine. Aussies loved the formula: Within 10 years, one in every two new cars sold in Australia was a Holden. Others in Detroit noticed Australia's predilection for cars that were American in flavor, and by 1960 both Ford and Chrysler had opened factories Down Under. Australian cars started out as mini-me Americana. The FC Holden of 1958 looked like a scaled-down '55 Chevy, and the FB Holden launched in 1960 echoed the grin and fins of a '57 Chevy. Early Falcons and Valiants were simply Australian-made copies of the American Ford and Chrysler compacts. By the late '60s, things had changed, however. The cleanly styled 1963 EH Holden looked vaguely American but was not obviously a riff on any domestic GM product. Chrysler's first Australian-designed Valiant appeared in 1971, and the Ford Australia studio set up by Jack Telnack in 1966 had its first all-Australian Falcon on the road by 1972. There were American influences in the styling and the mechanical hardware, but the cars were unique. In addition to four-door Holden, Falcon, and Valiant sedans, there were wagons, as well as two-door coupe, panel van, and long-wheelbase luxury variants. And, of course, everyone made a ute. They were created by Australian engineers and designers and built by Australian manufacturing specialists. Sure, senior execs rotated in from the head office Edsel Ford II ran Ford Australia's sales and marketing operation from 1978 to 1980, and Mark Reuss headed GMH in 2008 and 2009 but talent went the other way, as well. Former Ford Motor Company CEO Jac Nasser and current GM design chief Mike Simcoe started their careers in Australia. But Australia's auto industry had a fatal flaw. It had been tooled up around a single vehicle genre, the large family sedan, and by the early 21st century Australian consumers had come to prefer small hatchbacks, SUVs, and all-wheel-drive pickups instead. As long as Aussies had wanted vehicles that weren't made anywhere else and as long as there was support from the Australian government, GM and Ford could be persuaded to keep building Holdens and Falcons in Australia. But the home market simply wasn't big enough to justify the cost of retooling those factories to make cars, trucks, and SUVs that could be easily imported instead. Chasing export markets for Australian-made cars to keep Australian factories profitable wasn't really an option, either, as strategic product planning decisions made in Detroit were often at odds with a complex global matrix of cost imperatives and political expediency. An ambitious 1990s GMH plan to sell a version of the VT Holden Commodore in the U.S. as a Buick , for example, was ultimately killed by UAW opposition to the project. Read our Last Test of the Australian-made 2017 Chevrolet SS right here . Australia's best-selling vehicle last year was the Toyota HiLux pickup, followed by the Toyota Corolla , the Hyundai i30, and the Ford Ranger . The Australian car is dead, and with it an industry that once trained thousands of Australians in the art and science of automaking is, as well.

"I got a call from a man in West Virginia. I don't recall his name, but he wanted advice about buying a Boss 302 Mustang," Rick Parker said. Parker and his wife, Jacquie, operate Signature Auto Classics in Gahanna, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus specializing in Ford performance cars of the 1960s and early 1970s. Parker gave the caller some buying tips and then left him with one caveat if he did not buy the Boss 302, maybe he would give Rick second dibs on the car. That's exactly what happened. The Boss 302 proved to be too rough for the man in West Virginia, so he gave Rick the phone number of a man named Kenny in Pennsylvania. Kenny had the car at his house and was a neighbor friend of the two brothers that owned the Boss 302. "He did car repairs for them, if that makes sense. That's kind of his connection. He's a good fellow; good on cars. What a nice man, and we started talking cars." In that conversation, Parker discovered the two brothers, Keith and Brian, also owned a Boss 429 that was stored down the street from Kenny's house, in the back of their fabrication shop in the warehouse. "Kenny took me over to the warehouse, which is like 35,000 square feet, and asked if it was okay to take me back and show me the white Boss 429. It was sitting there with years and years of dirt and dust on it." On this visit, Rick Parker bought the project Boss 302. He didn't even touch the Boss 429 because it wasn't for sale. Still, it was impressive to see. "The hood was open. I remember seeing the air cleaner, the snorkel, the smog, the magnesium valve covers. I just thought, what a car!" Parker kept his patience and did not pester the two brothers to sell, but he made sure to keep in contact and let them know he was very interested in their Boss 429. A year passed, then two, and finally one day Parker spotted a text on his cell phone. The brothers were "ready to do something." Rick drove back to the shop for a hard look, to discover KK1470 a Boss 429 that was early enough to be an S-code, which was sweet news to Rick. He considers the S-code Boss 429 to be the most desirable of the 1969-1970 Boss 429s. "The first 279 were S-codes. They have magnesium valve covers. They have a bigger connecting rod, and then after Ford went through those first 279 cars they realized they didn't need all that on a regular street motor." The more Parker inspected this '69 Boss 429, the more impressed he was with the car's originality. Somebody had repainted the body 30-35 years ago, but the car was absolutely rust free and complete. Most Boss 429 barn finds, Rick says, are "missing air cleaner, snorkel, carburetor, and distributor." Not this one. Parker was so impressed he said it would be sad to restore this car. Back in Ohio at his shop, Rick said his biggest expense has been soap and water, because his plan is to "clean this car and enjoy it." &amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;gt; Follow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter

But here's the dilemma: There are only so many grilled chicken breasts you can eat before you get bored and turn to more flavorful ideas that often come with a big dose of unwanted calories. That's why we plucked out some of our favorites from the Eat This, Not That! archives for the most delicious poultry creations you can easily make at home. Add some of these 53 healthy chicken recipes for weight loss to your weekly lineup, and ditch chicken boredom once and for all. But before you check out the recipes, here are some helpful tips that will help you make sure your chicken recipe is safe to eat and delicious. And if you're looking for even more dishes to add to your weekly roundup, make sure you check out 18 Healthy Salmon Recipes You'll Love ! How do you properly store chicken in the fridge? "You want to store your chicken on the bottom of the fridge, under any cooked or raw products," says Patrick Ochs, corporate executive chef at Pubblica Italiana and Dalia at The Celino Hotel . If you're storing your container of leftover pasta under a couple of slabs of red meat, you definitely want to reconsider. Why? The last thing you want is the raw juices seeping into your already cooked food because it could cause foodborne illness. Why shouldn't you wash raw chicken? Washing raw chicken is a no-go. As Meredith Carothers, the technical information specialist at the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service told us in a former article that washing raw chicken in the sink increases the risk of cross-contamination. "By rinsing chicken meat, there is a potential to spread foodborne illness bacteria, like Salmonella or Campylobacter, to other surfaces or utensils," she said. "If these surfaces or utensils are not cleaned or sanitized, it could spread to ready-to-eat foods and cause foodborne illness." How can you tell when raw chicken has gone bad? Head chef of HelloFresh , Claudia Sidoti had previously told us in a different article that there are three main signs that indicate raw chicken has gone bad . "Fresh, raw chicken should have a pink, fleshy color. As it starts to go bad, the color fades to a shade of gray. If the color starts to look duller, you should use it immediately," she said. Once that meat turns gray, toss it! Another way is to smell it. If emits a potent, sour smell remove it from the fridge and throw away outside immediately. Thirdly, the chef instructed us to touch the meat, "Raw chicken naturally has a glossy, slimy texture. However, if the slime remains after rinsing underwater, it likely went bad." How long should you marinate your chicken for? "Depending on how much salt you use in your marinade, you can ideally marinate for days. I prefer to marinate for at least 24 hours to really penetrate the meat with flavor," says Ochs. Should you add salt to your marinade? "I personally prefer to add salt to my marinade, especially for large cuts of meat," says Ochs. "Depending on how much salt you use in the marinade, also limits the time you keep it on. Adding salts allow the meat to be evenly seasoned." RELATED: These are the easy, at-home recipes that help you lose weight. 1.

Simplest Beer Can Chicken Yes, this recipe calls for cooking a whole chicken mounted on beer cans. But hear us out: The liquid creates steam that helps cook the chicken from the inside and keep it moist.

Get our recipe for Simplest Beer Can Chicken . 15. Loaded Alfredo Pasta with Chicken and Vegetables We put a healthy spin on a typical Alfredo dish you would find at a restaurant.

Get our recipe for Chicken Under a Brick . 32. Chicken Burger With Sun-Dried Tomato Aioli We know chicken burgers can err on the side of bland, so this recipe takes the basic patty up a notch with a sun-dried tomato aioli sauce.

The Best-Ever Oven Fried Chicken Southerners may grunt and grumble about the travesty of "fried" chicken not being cooked in big skillets of melted lard, but we'd bring this crispy, succulent bird to a church potluck in Savannah without batting an eye. A long soak in buttermilk spiked with hot sauce both tenderizes and flavors the meat, while the spiced panko provides a layer of captivating crunch. We won't go as far as to say you won't taste the difference (properly fried chicken has a depth of flavor that stretches straight to your soul), but we can say with confidence that this chicken hits the spot. Get our recipe for Oven Fried Chicken. 36. Mom's Chicken Noodle Soup Chicken noodle soup does everything a comfort food is supposed to do, and does so without a hefty caloric price tag. But steer clear of canned chicken soup: Not only is it sparse on chicken and vegetables, but a single cup can also carry up to half a day's worth of sodium. This version is light on the salt, and loaded with chunky vegetables and shredded chicken for a truly hearty bowl of soup. Get our recipe for Mom's Chicken Noodle Soup. 37. Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Given the rate of wing consumption in this country, clearly hot sauce-slathered chicken and blue cheese is a winning combination for American palates. We stay true to the flavors people love basting the chicken in hot sauce butter after grilling, topping with a yogurt-based blue cheese sauce but manage to do what no one else out there has done yet: make Buffalo chicken into a healthy meal. Try the same technique with grilled shrimp. Get our recipe for Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. 38. Margarita Chicken Sizzling chicken and steak platters clutter the menus of nearly every major chain restaurant in this country, a testament to the enduring popularity of meat and melted cheese. We can't fault people for loving it who wouldn't? but we do take issue with the fact that these savory skillets rarely contain fewer than 1,000 calories, regardless of who's holding the spatula. That is, unless you are. Our version a meal that you can have on the table in 20 minutes contains all the same bells and whistles (Cheese! Salsa! Sizzle!) while skipping nearly 900 calories per portion. Get our recipe for Margarita Chicken . 39. Chicken Tikka Masala It takes many years to master the complex spice art at the heart of Indian cuisine, but tikka masala is the perfect beginner's dish light on ingre­dients and relatively mild in flavor. Tikka masala normally involves a heavy hand with both butter and cream, but we found that the combi­nation of Greek yogurt and half-and-half gives you the same velvety texture for a fraction of the calories. Get our recipe for Chicken Tikka Marsala. 40. Kung Pao Chicken What makes a stir-fry so incredibly comforting? It's knowing that, after a long, difficult day, a lean and flavor-packed meal can be prepared in a single pan in under 10 minutes. A real kung pao kicks like a karate kid, loaded with dried chiles that imbue the mash-up with a capsaicin glow. But in most versions across the restaurant and takeout spectrum, the heat takes a backseat to Chinese-American food's more dominant flavor profile: fat plus salt. This one puts the heat back in the driver's seat. Get our recipe for Kung Pao Chicken. 41. Sesame Noodles with Chicken Italians might cringe in horror to hear it, but the noodle originally comes from Asia. The point being though that sometimes, a box of fettuccine is just as appropriate for an Asian-inspired meal as it is for an Italian repast. Think of this as a salad, with the noodles sitting in for lettuce. Add some protein and as many or as few vegetables as you like, and toss the whole package with a light but powerful dressing. It's the culmination of four millennia of noodle knowledge. (Well, maybe not, but it's awfully tasty.) Get our recipe for Sesame Noodles with Chicken . 42. Thai Chicken Curry Redolent of ginger and lemongrass, chiles, and coconut milk, Thai curry brings all of the classic flavors of Southeast Asian cuisine salty, sour, bitter, hot together in one dish. What's more, it derives all of its flavors from ingredients packed with powerful antioxidants. Even coconut milk contains lauric acid, among the healthiest forms of fat you can consume. The flavors may be exotic, but the tender chicken, the bouquet of vegetables, and the rich coconut milk will all taste wonderfully familiar. Get our recipe for Thai Chicken Curry. 43. Chili-Mango Chicken Stir-Fry The combination of heat and sweet is a rollercoaster for our taste buds and a partnership that lurks behind knowingly or not our affection for so many Asian dishes: General Tso's, orange chicken, and mu shu pork, among others. Here, that combination upgrades a basic chicken stir-fry to something special with just two ingredients: The metabolism-boosting heat comes from a lashing of chili sauce (look for the bottle with the Red Rooster and a green screw-on cap) and the sweet from a thin coating of quick-cooked mango chunks. Get our recipe for Chili-Mango Chicken Stir Fry. 44. Chicken Scaloppine Another Italian classic lost in translation. Too many cooks (including the ones at Macaroni Grill) interpret this dish traditionally chicken or pork, lightly floured and cooked with sage and prosciutto as a huge helping of meat, breaded and fried and covered in a murky, sodium-strewn gravy. Our lighter, more authentic version wraps chicken and sage in a layer of prosciutto, which then becomes a crispy skin that keeps the chicken moist while it sautés. A splash of wine and chicken stock directly into the cooking pan becomes your 2-minute sauce. Just the latest proof of why simpler is so often better. Get our recipe for Chicken Scaloppine . 45. Chicken Cordon Bleu It's French in name, but it feels American, right down to its molten cheese core. Normally, this chicken is stuffed, breaded, then deep-fried into submission. But our testing found that a high-heat oven provides all the crunch we want without all the calories we don't. If honey mustard feels a bit like gilding the lily, it is, but at 350 calories for the whole dish, why not? Get our recipe for Chicken Cordon Bleu. 46.

The pressure of what to wear when you meet the president (and possibly the first lady) is tenfolds anxiety-inducing compared to picking out a normal ensemble for work meetings. Most of us mere mortals may never get to experience these nerves (we, for one, don't mind), but we can empathize with celebrities who often have a front row seat or access to meeting the president. When this happens, they are photographed and publicized (we want to know what happened when Barack Obama met The Rock!), which means their outfits have to be on point. And, you know the celebrity's team of stylists have carefully thought out his/her every outfits. Most celebrities appear in modest dresses, suits, and the like, along with giddy smiles and a few tears. Ahead, see what the stars wore while meeting the presidents. Katharine Hepburn With Franklin D. Roosevelt Did you know that FDR and Katharine Hepburn were related through a common ancestor on the Mayflower? Well, when the actress joined the president for a luncheon devoted planning a radio show special on behalf of his 1940 presidential election to which Hepburn wore a signature button down they probably talked about that and more. Marilyn Monroe With John F. Kennedy Hollywood's most iconic blonde bombshell sang a brow-raising rendition of "Happy Birthday" for President Kennedy's 45th birthday in a stunning glittery gown. Fun fact: This is the only known photo of the two rumored lovers. Barbra Streisand With John F. Kennedy Barbra Streisand is obviously a mega star in her own right, but even this diva looked smitten with JFK when she met him in 1963. Her elbow-length white gloves and feathery boa are fancy and fun. And look at that chic bob! Elvis Presley With Richard Nixon In 1970, Elvis appeared at the White House in a collar nearly as exaggerated as his belt and was named a "Federal Agent at Large" by President Nixon he also received an honorary badge. Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs, and Brooke Shields With Ronald Reagan President Reagan and his wife Nancy snapped a quick photo with the famous supermodels at a Tribute to Bob Hope's 80th birthday at the Kennedy Center in 1983. All the women were in gowns Brinkley in a two-piece number (a look that's recently back in style )! Michael Jackson With Ronald Reagan President Ronald Reagan awarded Michael Jackson with the Presidential Public Safety Communication Award; the award was the result of MJ's classic song "Beat It" being used as the anthem of Reagan's public service campaign against teen drinking and driving. The King of Pop donned a single glove, naturally. Michael Jackson With George H.W. Bush Michael Jackson visited the White House in this snazzy black and red military-inspired ensemble in 1990 when he received the "Artist of the Decade" award from the first President Bush. The megastar received this honor more than one time throughout his life. Whitney Houston With George H.W. Bush Music legend Whitney Houston got a private tour of the White House from the president himself 1990. During that visit, President Bush named the icon a "Point of Light Contributing Leader." Brooke Shields With George H.W. Bush In 1991, Brooke Shields joined President Bush and many others at "Welcome Home, America," the United Service Organization's 50th anniversary. (Her sleeves are perfectly turn-of-the-decade.) To the delight of the audience, Frank Sinatra sang the patriotic ballad "What is America to Me?" at the event. Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Diana Ross With Bill Clinton Many celebrities were thrilled when Bill Clinton was elected the 42nd president of the United States. Just before his inauguration, to celebrate cultural diversity, the likes of MJ, Diana Ross, and Stevie Wonder performed in a two-day festival called America's Reunion on the Mall . The monochromatic ensemble Ross chose for the event is truly as iconic as she is. Sarah Jessica Parker With Bill Clinton The VH1 Save the Music Foundation (founded in 1997) raised funding to maintain and support music programs in public schools across the United States. In 1999, the nonprofit organization held its Concert of the Century, and famous supporters of the arts such as SJP showed love. The star had just begun her role on Sex and the City and we think Carrie would very much approve of this outfit. Lenny Kravitz With Bill Clinton Grammy-winning rocker Leny Kravitz also performed at VH1's Concert of the Century. The "American Woman" singer rocked the mic onstage, showing off his patriotism with his red, white, and blue guitar. 'Merica. Meryl Streep With Bill Clinton Meryl Streep got close and personal with President Clinton at the Concert of the Century. The Oscar-winning actress maintained a close relationship with the Clinton family, campaigning for Secretary Hilary Clinton in her 2016 presidential bid and was reportedly considered to play her in a biopic. Keith Richards With Bill Clinton Only a rocker could meet a president in just a vest. Here, the Rolling Stones singer-songwriter poses with the former president backstage at the 2001 Concert for New York City, a benefit concert in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Mandy Moore With George W. Bush Mandy Moore appeared with President Bush and the FLOTUS at TNT's annual holiday spectacular, "Christmas in Washington," in 2001 (for which she chose an appropriately festive red dress). She starred in the romantic comedy classic The Princess Diaries and released her self-titled third album that same year. Ashanti With George W. Bush In 2003, R&B songstress Ashanti joined the president at the same holiday celebration clad in a chic black dress with button details. Carrie Underwood With George W. Bush "Christmas in Washington" continued in 2005, and Carrie Underwood belted out various holiday staples onstage including "Last Christmas" and "O Holy Night." All eyes were on the American Idol winner as she glittered in a sparkled in a white ballgown, reminiscent of holiday tinsel. Ciara With George W. Bush Ciara also scored an invite to the 2005 "Christmas in Washington" special, dressed in a festive emerald gown. The singer's debut album Goodies put her on the map , and Ciara spent much of that year touring the country with fellow R&B and hip hop up-and-comers Bow Wow and Omarion. Hilary Duff With George W. Bush When George W. Bush was elected president for a second time, the 2005 inaugural festivities included a youth concert headlined by Disney darling Hilary Duff (note the totally early 2000s red streaks in her hair) and featuring American Idol winner Reuben Studdard, Jojo, and Ryan Cabrera. The concert, called "America's Future Rocks Today," caused a stir when Brett Scallions of the band Fuel cursed on stage. A totally different time, 2005. Oprah Winfrey With Barack Obama Oprah Winfrey stepped out in a grey power suit to offer one of the earliest endorsements of then-Senator Barack Obama's first presidential run in 2007. Passionate about the young senator's cause and drive, the TV mogul even hit the road with the Obamas and joined them on the campaign trail. To this day, Winfrey and the Obamas remain the best of friends. Kerry Washington and Usher With Barack Obama Kerry Washington and Usher showed some love to the future 44th president as he campaigned for his first election in 2008. The trio reunited once more at President Obama's White House farewell party in 2017, which, apparently, was a total rager  word on the street is that the demure actress was moshing! Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony With Barack Obama Snazzily dressed in their best black-tie attire, J.Lo and Marc Anthony posed with the First Couple at President Obama's inaugural ball in 2008. The then-married couple also performed together at the big event, singing the romantic duet "No Me Ames" onstage. Fergie With Barack Obama Barack Obama thanks Fergie for performing the national anthem during the 2009 White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn in 2009. The star wore a classic white trench coat. Mariska Hargitay With Barack Obama Barack Obama and Law and Order: SVU star Mariska Hargitay shared an air kiss during a Domestic Violence Awareness Month event in the East Room of the White House in 2010. The star kept it classic in black, which also paid homage to her character Olivia Benson's professional wardrobe. Kobe Bryant With Barack Obama The Los Angeles Lakers guard looked so dapper in a suit while presenting a jersey to Barack Obama during an event with the National Basketball Association 2009 champions in the East Room of the White House in 2010. George Clooney With Barack Obama The actor dressed up in formal attire and visited Obama to talk about Sudan during a meeting outside the Oval Office in 2010. Sheryl Crow With Barack Obama Sheryl Crow went in for a hug after hitting the stage at the 2009 "We are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration" in Washington, D.C. (in a T-shirt featuring his visage, no less). The singer-songwriter supported President Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and even performed at a 2015 Democratic primary debate. Alicia Keys With Barack Obama The "Girl on Fire" reconnected with President Obama at a World AIDS Day event at George Washington University. The event, Hosted by ONE and (RED), was attended by politicians (including former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton) and major entertainment influencers like Keys and U2 frontman Bono. Jennifer Hudson, Victoria Justice, and Justin Bieber With Barack Obama The celebrities joined the First Family in the capital for the the 2011 "Christmas in Washington" festivities. And all showed up in their formal holiday best (Bieber even went for a white jacket!). It wouldn't be Jennifer Hudson's last time performing in front of the Obamas, however; the Chicago native dazzled the crowd at the president's second inaugural ball with a jazzy rendition of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together." Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara With Barack Obama The cast of ABC's family sitcom Modern Family laughed it up with the president during a 2012 visit to the White House. President Obama looked excited to be meeting some of his favorite actors he is, after all a huge fan of the show and tunes in regularly to watch the Pritchett family's shenanigans. (Unrelated, but can we just take a moment of appreciation for Bowen's biceps?) Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney, and Kyla Ross With Barack Obama President Obama hosted a reception for the 2012 US Olympic women's gymnastics team in the White House, celebrating the Fierce Five's accomplishments at the London games. The young women traded their leotards and warm up suits for business casual. The ever-playful POTUS even asked to pose with McKayla Maroney to recreate her viral "not impressed" face. "[Obama] the coolest person I ever met," the gold medal-winning gymnast said about the president. "He's got the hardest job in the entire world." Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck With Barack Obama In 2010, President Obama became the first sitting president ever to appear on a daytime television show when he appeared on The View . The cast's choice of apparel didn't differ much from what they typically wear for the show, with each woman showing off her personality via her clothing. Two years later, he and Michelle visited the ABC show again to talk about his presidency and his desire to be re-elected. Katy Perry With Barack Obama "What are those?!" Just kidding. At a 2012 event in Doolittle Park, Katy Perry showed off her killer shoes to President Obama as her grandmother (who was also her date for the night so precious!) looked on. David Beckham With Barack Obama David Beckham shook hands with the president they were both in a suit and tie after his team won the Major League Soccer Cup in 2012. Shakira With Barack Obama The president shook hands with Shakira, who wore a casual ensemble, during an event to hand over land titles to representatives of the Afro-Colombian community at the Plaza de San Pedro in Cartagena, Colombia in 2012. Beyoncé With Barack Obama Beyoncé was personally selected to sing the national anthem at President Obama's second inauguration ceremony in 2013, and looked stunning . But her performance wasn't without controversy. Critics believed that Beyoncé had lip-synced through the entire song (really?), but she was able to prove her haters wrong when she gave a stellar impromptu performance of the song a week later during her Super Bowl press conference. We never doubted you, Bey. Kelly Clarkson With Barack Obama Kelly Clarkson also attended President Obama's second inauguration, sporting a burgundy peacoat and a bright purple scarf for the occasion. The singer reminded the country that she is *the* original American Idol with a heartfelt and passionate rendition of "My Country Tis of Thee." Dwyane Wade and LeBron James With Barack Obama After the Miami Heat won the 2013 NBA championship, the entire team swapped their jerseys for tailored suits to visit the president, who just happens to be a major basketball fan. Though he should be partial to the Chicago Bulls because of the hometown connection, President Obama has admitted that he would have liked to play for the San Antonio Spurs if he were a pro-baller. "They're smart, they're well-run, they're focused on team," he said of the Spurs in 2018. "They treat everybody in the organization with respect, and that is the kind of organization that I want to be a part of." Mariah Carey With Barack Obama The Queen of Whistle Notes and Shade Mariah Carey was all smiles beside President Obama during the 2013 National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony in Washington D.C. Guess she knows him. Gloria Steinem With Barack Obama President Barack Obama awarded Gloria Steinem, who wore a classic black dress, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2013. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson With Barack Obama At the 2014 TNT "Christmas in Washington" event, President Obama exchanged greetings with The Rock, who really stepped up his game in a three-piece suit, onstage. A year later, the two would cross paths again..well, kinda the actor played The Rock Obama , the angry, jacked up version of the president, in a Saturday Night Live skit when he hosted the show in 2015. Rita Ora With Barack Obama Rita Ora also attended "Christmas in Washington," joining the Obamas onstage to sing Christmas carols and we really want a pair of gloves. Meryl Streep With Barack Obama In 2014, President Obama awarded Hollywood legend Meryl Streep with a Medal of Freedom for the indelible impact she made on the world of acting. He may have held the highest title in the land as president, but Obama was also pretty much the president of Streep's fan club. "I love Meryl Streep," President Obama gushed at the event. "Her husband knows I love her. Michelle knows I love her. There's nothing they can do about it." Streep, who has a very specific aesthetic and doesn't bend to the whims of fashion, chose a wildlife motif dress to receive the honor. Ellen Degeneres With Barack Obama During the last few months of his presidency, President Obama made an appearance on The Ellen Show to talk about his wife Michelle, his daughters, and his life plans post-White House. Ellen wore her usual button-down and suit jacket combo. Later that year, Obama awarded his bestie (and Diana Ross, Robert DeNiro AND Tom Hanks) with a Medal of Freedom for her contributions to the LGBT community. Eva Longoria With Barack Obama Eva Longoria joined President Obama in a rousing rendition of "Jingle Bells" in a white belted coat dress at the 94th Annual National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony in 2016. The actress has long been a friend and supporter of the president; she campaigned for Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and even served on a high-profile committee to help hm figure out what he should do after his tenure in the White House. Janelle Monae With Barack Obama Rocking a fabulous coat, Janelle Monae performed at the White House Fourth of July party at the request of President Obama's daughter Malia, who also happened to be celebrating her 18th birthday. The fête was the first of many great Obama-hosted parties that the singer attended, and to this day, Monae maintains that "there is nobody who can party like [Barack Obama]." Hope our invite doesn't get lost in the mail next time! Aretha Franklin With Barack Obama The two share a laugh at the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building in 2015. Barack Obama and the singer, who was in a neutral metallic ensemble, were there for the portrait unveiling ceremony for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Hilary Swank With Barack Obama The two shared a friendly hello during the second-annual White House Student Film Festival in 2015. The event features the winning short films created by students highlighting the idea of service and helping the community. Swank kept it sleek and profesh in a dark colored blazer. Ludacris With Barack Obama The president greets musician Ludacris (who was in a suit) and other guests during a gathering of criminal actors, hip-hip artists, justice activists, state and local elected officials, and community leaders in 2015. The leaders gathered for a screening of Fixing the System , a special documentary about criminal justice reform. Reese Witherspoon With Barack Obama The actress was bundled up in black as she stood on stage with Barack Obama and Malia Obama during the national Christmas tree lighting ceremony in 2015. Leonardo DiCaprio With Barack Obama The actor and president, both in full suits, arrived for a discussion on climate change during the South by South Lawn festival at the White House in 2016. Prince Harry and Barack Obama The pair matched in crisp button-downs while watching a wheelchair basketball game on day 7 of the Invictus Games in Toronto in 2017. Kanye West With Donald Trump Kanye West shocked the world when he announced his support for the 45th president of the United States. West claimed that he went to Trump Tower in early 2017 in black sweats and a gold chain to talk to the president about finding solutions to gun violence in his hometown of Chicago. Though he didn't vote in the 2016 election, the rapper said that he would have been Team Trump if he had, putting him in direct conflict with his wife and Hillary Clinton supporter Kim Kardashian. Kanye West and Jim Brown With Donald Trump Kanye rocked a "Make America Great Again" red hat while retired NFL player Jim Brown donned a suit as they made an appearance at the Oval Office to have a chat with the president. Brown has used his stardom to advocate for civil rights and spearhead initiatives to help African Americans. Kim Kardashian With Donald Trump The reality star and business mogul went to the White House in May 2018 to meet with Trump about criminal justice reform issues, which eventually lead to Trump granting 63-year-old Alice Marie Johnson clemency for a low-level, non-violent drug offense that happened in the '90s. Here, Kim, dressed in a blazer, is pictured speaking alongside the president in June 2019 at a second chance hiring and criminal justice reform event in Washington D.C. Kid Rock With Donald Trump The musician is an avid Trump supporter , so no surprise here that he was all dressed up at the White House while shaking hands with Trump in October 2018. The musician was there prior to the signing of H.R. 1551, the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act . The Trumps With Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, and Camilla Parker Bowles The Queen, a (royal) celebrity in her own right, along with her family, met with Melania and Trump in December 2019. The group gathered for a reception hosted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II ahead of the NATO alliance summit. All the ladies wore their brightest hues.

BBUoXbO	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	For Better Meatloaf, Use This Big Little Trick	From the meat to the mix-ins, anything is fair game.	A Big Little Recipe has the smallest-possible ingredient list and big everything else: flavor, creativity, wow factor. Psst we don't count water, salt, black pepper, and certain fats (specifically, 1/2 cup or less of olive oil, vegetable oil, and butter), since we're guessing you have those covered. Today, we're making your new favorite meatloaf. Meatloaf has been an American favorite since the late 1800s . So it's no surprise that, over a century later, the number of meatloaf recipes is seemingly endless (or, over 30 million according to Google). From the meat to the mix-ins, anything is fair game. Take this favorite Food52 recipe: Meatloaf, Plain and Simple by longtime Food52er Sdebrango . When it won our Your Best Dinner That Makes a Good Lunch recipe contest, Food52 editors described it as a "no-frills meatloaf" with "everything you love with none of the distractions." Yet it still has 14 ingredients , including two meats (beef, pork) and various vegetables (onion, carrot, celery). For what it's worth, compared to a lot of meatloaf recipes, Sdebrango's is relatively simple. This one uses three meats and comes with its own homemade blackberry barbecue sauce. This one throws in bacon and Parmesan for good measure. And this one is so umami-focused, its glaze alone has six ingredients. So, just how simple can classic meatloaf be? We know we need to add mix-ins, otherwise we'd just have a giant hamburger. But which ingredients are necessary? And which ones can we do without? Meat It's called meatloaf for a reason. (Though, I have always wanted to try this lentil loaf !) The default pick is beef in American cookbook classics from The Joy of Cooking to The Fannie Farmer Cookbook . Pork and veal sometimes make an appearance, as do wildcards like bacon and pancetta. But, if all-beef was good enough for the recipes that helped make meatloaf such a favorite in the first place, it's good enough for me. If you can, get freshly ground beef from a butcher; it's coarser and looser, which means a less-dense loaf. And I like to use 15 to 20 percent fat, which means a very-flavorful, never-dry loaf. Bread In The Food Lab , J. Kenji Lopéz-Alt describes bread crumbs as "perhaps the most important ingredient of all when it comes to improving the texture of a meatloaf." Not only do they help retain moisture, but they increase tenderness, too. Some cooks use other starchy ingredients, like rolled oats or even puffed rice cereal , but we're going to use English muffins. Unusual, yes, but stick with me: In a meaty situation like this, I prefer blitzing up my own fresh bread crumbs versus using dried. But the catch with fresh bread? Its crust is often too hard to blitz, so recipes will tell you to ditch it. But the catch with ditching the crust? It's full of flavor. Because English muffins are individually shaped, they have an even higher ratio of crust, and, because they're pre-packaged, the crusts are soft and blitz-able. They're also reliably flavorful, with sourdough-esque vibes. And I always have them in my freezer. Eggs Sure, egg yolks add some rich flavor to a meatloaf, but the real reason we need eggs is for structure to help bind the meatloaf together. This is especially important since we're making a free-form meatloaf, or one that you shape by hand, versus using a loaf pan. The shape won't be as perfectly rectangular, but the crust will be way better (read: more deeply browned) since there's more exposed surface area. Thanks to the eggs, our free-form loaf will stay together in the oven and yield neat slices at the table. Onions While bread and eggs are structural they bind the meatloaf aromatics are all about flavor. Which is probably why so many recipes have so much fun with them. Onion, celery, carrot, mushrooms, fresh herbs, dried herbs, and on, and on. This recipe stops at onion. Admittedly, I didn't think this would be enough. But my standard approach for Big Little Recipes is to start as simple as possible, then add more as necessary. So, I sautéed yellow onion like, a lot of yellow onion until it was very tender (the last thing you want in a meatloaf is crunchy bits) and had complex, caramelized flavors. And, to my own surprise, the result was chef kissing fingers. It reminds me of French onion soup, where you need little more than onions and beef broth to make something special. Ketchup Every meatloaf needs a glaze. Many of them are ketchup-based, with perky additions like dried spices, vinegar, and sugar. The ironic part is that ketchup already has dried spices, vinegar, and sugar. Which is why a lot of cooks (including Ina Garten ) just use ketchup. We'll do the same. Think of it like ketchup on a burger it's simple, and it works. I also like mixing some ketchup into the meatloaf itself, to add a little sweetness and acidity to balance all the savoriness. A lot of recipes call for tomato paste to do the same, but why bother when we're already using another flavorful tomatey ingredient? Water! The secret ingredient in the legendary restaurant Rao's meatballs is water. Yep, water. As in, two cups of water mixed into two pounds of meat. This nifty trick yields a noticeably moister, lighter meatball and, if a meatloaf is just an oversized meatball, why can't the same apply? I tried the Rao's ratio with one meatloaf and let's just say it didn't go great. Decreasing the water fixed all this. Then, adding the water at a different step took an otherwise humble meatloaf over the top. Remember those caramelized onions? As soon as they're golden brown, we're going to pour the water all over them. Not only does this cool them down faster, but it de-glazes all those good bits stuck to the bottom of the pan and creates an ultra-flavorful onion broth. Plus, it's a headstart for cleaning your sauté pan. That's pretty cool, too. If you're like me, you already have most of these ingredients in your kitchen. And while the whole thing comes together quick enough for a weeknight, I think it's the perfect Sunday supper not in the least because any leftovers make the very best sandwiches to bring to work throughout the week.

A big engine, bold looks, and expansive interior should keep the all-new Camry selling.   Cleveland, OH I've never understood the Toyota Camry 's popularity. It's not the best midsize sedan in most categories, and yet it has wildly outsold all others for years. The latest Camry, completely redesigned for 2018, seems to be more of the same: more expressive styling, more power, more space, more safety, and more efficiency. Going by past experience, it's safe to bet it will get more sales, too. While its new styling isn't for everyone, including myself, the Camry offers enough to appreciate that I can see why tens of thousands of people continue to buy one each month. Truly, the only damning complaint left is that it still doesn't offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, though Toyota intends to fix that next year. Read also: 2018 Toyota Camry First Drive: The Same As Ever, But Better 2018 Honda Accord Vs. 2018 Toyota Camry: The Family Sedan Battle 2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid Review: More Efficient, More Useful The new Camry has a starting price of $23,495, which isn't the lowest in the segment, but you get what pay for; the base Camry LE comes equipped with standard tech, infotainment, and safety features that most base-model competitors don't. The Camry XSE I tested, meanwhile, costs $35,333 and comes with Toyota's new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. You can spend even more, however, by choosing the optional 3.5-liter V6 engine. Still, regardless of engine, the XSE is the Camry's new top trim level, and it's common these days for fully loaded midsizesize sedans to reach over thirty-five grand in price. Toyota hasn't played it safe with the Camry's design in recent years. The last few generations have been penned with an aggressively styled look that never seemed to match its four-door family car mission. And yet, people have continued to buy them in droves. This new design is the wildest one yet, especially in this sporty-looking XSE trim. Toyota does give you options, though; other trims have tamer front and rear fascias. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and while my eyes don't behold a lot beauty in the Camry, I do appreciate the functionality contained within its shape. The roofline, for instance, doesn't slope into the rear window until after the passenger compartment, which provides for class-reading rear seat headroom. Also, designers have pulled down the bottom of the side windows, which combats claustrophobia and aids visibility. The new Camry's interior is well designed and constructed with materials appropriate for its price point. That is to say, it's no luxury car, but neither does it feel cheap inside. There's decent leather on the seats, nicely finished plastics, and some glossy surfaces to mix things up. Again, though, look past the shape of things to find what makes the interior special: space! The Camry is a very roomy sedan   among the best in the segment and behind only the new Honda Accord . Rear-seat passengers, in particular, have a surprising amount of space to stretch out their limbs. Note, though, that Toyota achieved this feat, despite shrinking the car's height, by lowering the seats themselves some inches. That means the Camry may be harder to get in and out of for some people. While Toyota has updated its Entune infotainment system with better graphics and snappier performance, it still looks and operates like a system that's a few years older than state of the art. Also, Toyota is still not offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on the Camry either, though we're told it will be on 2019 models. Ironically, the Camry does offer wireless charging for your smartphone, which is accomplished via a well-placed charging pad ahead of the shifter. Other bits of tech to appreciate inside the Camry include the large, high-res head-up display, and a fair number of USB ports for charging devices. Toyota gets kudos for offering a pair of very powerful engines. One is a 3.5-liter V6 offering a muscle car-like 301 horsepower, while my Camry XSE tester sports the new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 208 horsepower and 186 pound-feet of torque. In other trim levels, it still makes 203 hp, and that's more power than base engines in the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima , and Chevy Malibu , and its fuel efficiency is among the highest in the group, as well. That said, the 2.5-liter is naturally aspirated, and without the aid of a turbocharger, achieving peak power requires lots of revs. The eight-speed automatic transmission, meanwhile, is tuned for efficiency and upshifts as quickly as possible. Thus, the engine's full power isn't normally felt unless you snick the shifter over into Sport mode, which remaps the shift points to hold gears longer. As for handling, the Camry benefits from an all-new platform that's significantly stronger than before, as well as a new rear suspension, both of which contribute to a higher level of overall handling. Other things, like the steering and braking, feel more capable than in Camry's past, too. Better than before, however, doesn't mean best; the Camry's handling still falls short of segment leaders like the Mazda6 and Honda Accord. Toyota takes safety seriously because it knows that buyers do too. Every Camry sold, regardless of price and trim level, comes with the Toyota Safety Sense suite of advanced safety features. This includes automatic emergency braking, full-speed radar-based cruise control, a lane departure warning system with lane-keep assist, and automatic high beams. This XSE model also comes standard with a blind spot and rear cross traffic alert system, as well as front and rear parking aid sensors. And finally, an optional 360-degree camera system is also included. More and more automakers are following Toyota's lead by including advanced safety features as standard equipment on all their cars. Ford recently announced that its CoPilot360 safety suite will soon come standard on all models, and Nissan has promised the new 2019 Altima midsize sedan will come standard with automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and Intelligent Driver Alertness. Still, Toyota deserves credit for starting this trend that greatly increases the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike. As mentioned, despite the Camry's new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine being the most powerful base engine you can buy in a midsizesize family sedan, it's also one of the most fuel efficient. It scores official ratings of 28 miles per gallon in the city, 39 on the highway, and 32 combined. While the new Accord has a slightly higher combined rating of 33 mpg, the Camry bests it on the highway by one mpg. The Camry also has a big 16-gallon fuel tank, which means over 500 miles can go by between fill ups. If fuel efficiency is your top priority, Toyota also offers the Camry Hybrid, which can achieve up to an incredible 52 mpg combined. What's more, Toyota offers the hybrid version in several trim levels, not just expensive ones that come loaded with features you may not want. Even the base Camry LE is offered as a hybrid.

AA5bCkb	autos	autosnews	2014 Lincoln MKZ	With the Lincoln MKZ redesigned for 2013, changes for 2014 are limited to new paint options. As a completely redesigned model in 2013, the 2014 Lincoln MKZ sedan has few changes for 2014.	Vehicle Overview As a completely redesigned model in 2013, the 2014 Lincoln MKZ sedan has few changes for 2014. Although the MKZ shares much of its underpinnings with the Ford Fusion sedan, the Lincoln is larger overall. Unlike the Fusion, a V-6 engine is available on the MKZ. The base engine is a 240-hp 2.0-liter EcoBoost I4 with 270 lb-ft of torque, while a 300-hp, 277 lb¬-ft 3.7-liter V-6 is available. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic and are available in front- or all-wheel drive. Four-cylinder models are EPA-rated 22/33 mpg city/highway with front-drive and 22/31 mpg with all-wheel-drive. The V-6 front-drive model is rated 19/28 mpg, while all-wheel-drive models are rated 18/26 mpg. An MKZ Hybrid is also available. The hybrid model is powered by a 141-hp, 129 lb-ft 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle I-4 mated to an 88-kW electric motor and a CVT. The MKZ Hybrid is EPA-rated 45/45 mpg. After the 2013 MKZ 's debut at the 2012 New York auto show, we said, "While it's way too early to say whether the 2013 MKZ will help reverse Lincoln's fortunes, on paper at least it looks to be a strong entrant in its segment, with a number of unique features and design touches that should help distinguish it from the Ford sibling." We were impressed with the 2013 Lincoln MKZ 2.0 AWD's performance during our First Test due in part to its performance tires. "The sticky rubber certainly helped generate some damn impressive test numbers. Try 106 feet to stop from 60 mph (1 foot better than the 2013 Mustang GT!), 0.91 g on the skidpad (just 0.03 g shy of the Mustang!), and a 26.5-second time in our figure eight. While its sub-110-foot braking figure can be attributed in part to the cheater tires, the MKZ's handling number isn't that inflated. … The Super Sports also helped the 200-pound-heavier Lincoln slightly beat the Fusion's acceleration figures with times of 6.6 seconds in the 0-60 sprint and 15.0 seconds through the quarter mile." The Lincoln MKZ offers a huge new panoramic glass roof. The 15.2 square-foot glass panel can slide back dramatically to create a large roof opening. Lincoln also says the glass reportedly provides the same protection from harmful rays as SPF 100 sunscreen." Other unique features include gear selector buttons on the left side of the center stack and a two-tier center console. The 2014 Lincoln MKZ sedan has a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars) and is considered a Top Safety Pick+ by the IIHS for cars built after November 2012. New for 2014 With the Lincoln MKZ redesigned for 2013, changes for 2014 are limited to new paint options.

BBH6ntg	autos	autosmidsize	2018 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T First Test Review: Quicker and More Agile	A fresh look at Hyundai's middling midsizer	Once incredibly popular, midsize sedans are quickly falling out of favor as Americans choose crossovers. Every single nonpremium midsize sedan on the market has slipped in the sales charts during the first 11 months of 2017. But that doesn't mean the segment is becoming any less competitive. Honda has rolled out an impressive new Accord , right on the heels of Toyota introducing a solid new Camry . For the 2018 model year, Hyundai has spruced up the Sonata with a fresh transmission lineup, a more upscale interior, and a more refined exterior with a newly designed grille, hood, and headlights. An updated chassis succeeds in improving handling. Despite many changes, Hyundai kept the same engines. Most buyers will find the standard 2.4-liter engine sufficient with 185 hp, as we've noted before. The 2.0-liter turbo-four engine still makes 245 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, but it receives a new eight-speed automatic transmission. The turbocharged Sonata drives like a V-6 without feeling bulky. Remarkably, our turbocharged 2018 Sonata tester went from 0 to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds. That's almost a whole second quicker than the prerefresh 2015 Sonata Sport 2.0T we clocked at 8.0 seconds. Unfortunately, this more potent Sonata is slower than its direct competitors. A 2018 Honda Accord 2.0T Touring we tested reached 60 mph in just 5.7 seconds, tying a 2017 Chevrolet Malibu 2.0T Premier we've also tested. The Sonata also fell behind in the quarter-mile run with a time of 15.3 seconds at 93.7 mph. The Accord managed the run in 14.3 seconds at 99.3 mph, and the Malibu sped through the test in 14.3 seconds at 99.4 mph. Associate road test editor Erick Ayapana and testing director Kim Reynolds both praised the Sonata for its satisfying brake feel during the track tests. Reynolds noted the Sonata felt nimble around the figure eight, where it recorded a time of 26.7 seconds at an average of 0.66 g pretty close to competitors we've tested. On real roads, the Sonata doesn't feel like a large sedan as it would be considered these days. It handles tighter maneuvers with ease; we didn't have to make nearly as many three-point turns as we expected. As we said in our First Drive review, the eight-speed transmission performs smoothly. Hyundai updated the Sonata's steering, and it shows. The result is a precise steering wheel that does what you command it to do. Buyers looking to maximize fuel economy will likely choose the Sonata Eco. If you're willing to make do with 178 hp, you can achieve an estimated 28/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined on this model. Our more powerful Sonata is rated 23/32/26 mpg. Or at least that's what the EPA says. In our Real MPG tests, the turbo Sonata exceeded expectations by a considerable margin. Our results came back at 23.5/40.5/28.9 mpg city/highway/combined. That highway number would be quite impressive even on smaller cars with smaller engines. Although slower than certain competitors, the Sonata 2.0T receives a competitive price tag. This top-trim model came loaded with standard features; there are no packages and limited accessories available. Safety features include rear parking sensors, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind-spot detection, rear cross traffic alert, lane change assist, lane keep assist, and brake assist. Meanwhile, expect almost all the comfort and convenience features you can hope for on a model in this segment, including a hands-free trunk, LED headlights and taillights, heated and ventilated front seats, dual-zone auto climate control, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless device charging, and a 10-speaker audio system with subwoofer. Special visual cues including a mesh grille, dark chrome exterior trim, black lower front bumper, and black bezel headlamps are included on 2.0T models. After adding carpeted floor mats, our model rang out to $33,460. The 2018 Honda Accord Touring with the 2.0-liter engine has a similar set of features, but it wears a price tag of $36,690. However, this model comes standard with a head-up display. Inside the cabin, the Sonata 2.0T doesn't look quite as new as the Accord. While other automakers are moving toward touchscreen-only controls, the Sonata still has quite a few buttons. The infotainment system also looks a little older, thanks in part to the map graphics. But we found the sport seats to be very comfortable. It's quite easy to see out of the Sonata, thanks to its low front windshield and large side windows. In our eyes, the Sonata is not the top competitor in its segment. But once again, the Sonata stands apart because it offers great value for the money, a particularly impressive feat once you get to the top trim level. With improved acceleration and driving dynamics, as trite as it sounds, the Sonata is a good pick in a segment filled with many good options. 2018 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T Limited BASE PRICE $33,335 PRICE AS TESTED $33,460 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front-engine, FWD, 5-pass, 4-door sedan ENGINE 2.0L/245-hp/260-lb-ft turbo DOHC 16-valve I-4 TRANSMISSION 8-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 3,522 lb (61/39%) WHEELBASE 110.4 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 191.1 x 73.4 x 58.1 in 0-60 MPH 7.1 sec QUARTER MILE 15.3 sec @ 93.7 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 113 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.87 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 26.7 sec @ 0.66 g (avg) REAL MPG, CITY/HWY/COMB 23.5/40.5/28.9 mpg EPA CITY/HWY/COMB FUEL ECON 23/32/26 mpg ENERGY CONS, CITY/HWY 147/105 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS, COMB 0.74 lb/mile
BBHnGQc	autos	autosreview	2018 Ford Mustang GT Manual	2018 Ford Mustang GT Manual	From the February 2018 issue The arrival of the 2016 GT350 made the Mustang GT the middle child of the family overnight. We praised, doted on, and rewarded the GT350, giving it two 10Best Cars awards. But we will admit that its exotic-sounding 8250-rpm 5.2-liter V-8 made us a little neglectful of the rest of the brood. Here we are in a Mustang GT review, and we still can't shut up about its big brother. Middle children hate this. For 2018, Ford makes some changes to the GT that earn it more of our attention. Clearly we are gaga for high-revving V-8s, so we love that the GT's conventional cross-plane V-8 now revs to 7400 rpm, 400 more than before and a mere 850 short of the GT350's. Direct injection joins port injection, and the compression ratio rises from 11.0:1 to 12.0:1, bumping horsepower from 435 to 460, or 66 shy of the GT350. Torque rises from 400 pound-feet to 420. Other changes include the swapping of steel cylinder liners for a spray-in coating, a change that increases displacement from 4951 cubic centimeters to 5038. Don't worry; it's still a five-oh. In testing, our six-speed manual transmission (a 10-speed automatic is optional) matched the zero-to-60-mph time of the outgoing car at 4.3 seconds but opened 0.3-second and 3-mph gaps through the quarter-mile with a 12.6-second run at 115 mph. By 150 mph, the new GT was 2.4 seconds quicker. The extra power isn't glaringly obvious, but it gives the GT barstool bragging rights over the 455-hp Chevrolet Camaro SS. Just know that if the argument spills into the streets, the Chevy is still quicker. An optional GT Performance package brings larger front brakes, a limited-slip differential, and Michelin's newest performance tire, the Pilot Sport 4S, sized 255/40ZR-19 up front and 275/40ZR-19 out back. Choosing the $1695 MagneRide option also inverts the Stang's front struts and tweaks the spring rates for greater lateral and vertical stiffness. Cornering grip rises slightly to 0.96 g (we saw 0.94 g in the old model) thanks to the GT Performance pack, but that's just a number. It wasn't until we took the GT through the Angeles National Forest that we learned how it has adopted the stability and willingness of the GT350. Body roll is tightly checked, the magnetorheological dampers glue the tires to the tarmac without brutalizing the ride, and the Michelins give more warnings than a TSA officer. Even the electrically assisted steering reacts naturally and has pleasing heft. The GT starts at $35,995. One like our test car equipped with the new digital instrument cluster, power leather seats, the latest Sync infotainment system, MagneRide dampers, and the GT Performance package pushes $50,000. A GT350 is about $8000 more. Skip a few nonperformance options and you'd have a $44,000 GT, a car we'd never neglect.

BBGim3y	autos	autosenthusiasts	1988 Mazda RX-7 SE - 1,100hp Afterthought	Will Tetro never planned on having an 1,100hp FC RX-7 with a Chevy V8 under its hood. It just sort of happened.	You go out and get yourself a '97 Accord LX with an intake when you go looking for some sort of alternative to driving that truck of yours around full-time. Will Tetro, he goes out and builds an 1,100hp RX-7 for that. Will isn't exactly the superhero you think he is, though, mobbing to work and back in an '88 Mazda with roughly eight times the power it's supposed to have. "Honestly, this car was never supposed to be brought to this level," he says, dashing whatever image you may have already formed of full-throttle passes home from the grocery store with a ham on the passenger seat. The truth? It all happened as an afterthought. Will's always liked Mazda's sports car platform his mom owned a first-generation model before he was born, and he later bought an FD body. So when a friend offered to sell him the missing link to the RX-7 trifecta, he was all over it. His wanting to make the car something special, though, that was a product of how unique the chassis is. "One of the main reasons I built the FC was because it's different," he says. "I'm not saying the FC is anything rare, but you don't see a lot of them anymore." But an FC-bodied RX-7 with one of Chevy's LS V-8s underneath the hood, that indeed might be rare. Scrapping the rotary for that box of reciprocating bits started with 403 ci worth of Chevrolet originally destined for Will's later-model RX-7 and ended with a transmission meant for a Nissan and a rear end taken from a Ford. You think getting the major pieces from four different carmakers to play nicely with one another was the hard part, and you'd be right. But it wasn't the worst of it. "I wanted it to have every creature comfort the car [originally] had plus a reliable but stout drivetrain," he says. "Fitting the twin-turbo LS with AC, power steering, a heater, and traction control, they all had their fair share of challenges to overcome." But you stopped paying attention right after the words "twin-turbo LS." A 76mm Turbonetics turbo branching off of each side of a small-block will do that to you, but don't let any of that get in between you and the rest of what Will's come up with. Like the carbon-fiber rear wing cooked up by the people at Coast Chassis Design the same guys who built the FC's rollbar and who turned out the aero piece from a modified version originally designed for a Pro Mod drag car. There's a theme going on here, and it doesn't have much to do with anything other than going in a straight line and quickly. It's a part of Will's heritage, drag racing is, and you'll know it by the 800hp, fourth-generation-era Mustang Mach 1 he'd owned before getting his first non-domestic, an LS-powered S13. Even the FD RX-7 he still has remains dragstrip-bound. "I want to start running more standing half-mile events," Will says about what he plans on doing with the FC and alluding to its 200-mph potential. Trap speeds like those won't come without their share of broken parts, but Will's current FC recipe says all of that ought to be kept to a minimum. A recipe that includes things like an 8.8-inch Ford rear end with its independent suspension that'll help keep things from getting squirrelly and that sits across from a gearbox nabbed from a 350Z. It's a far cry from everything originally attached to that naturally aspirated 13B that wasn't even good for 150 hp and it's worth it, even if it does mean Will having to sort everything out among four different nameplates. Not that that's anything new for Will, though. When he's not figuring out how to make Nissan parts get along with mid-'80s Mazdas and Chevy engines, he's turning wrenches at his family's classic car restoration shop where the company turns out frame-off, concourse restorations along with the occasional hot rod buildup. "I spent every day that I wasn't in school at the shop," he says about his formative years. Spend a few minutes looking at his FC and that becomes obvious. Will's project car history doesn't seem to follow any boundaries. "Naturally, being brought up around American muscle cars, I was drawn to modified V8s," he says. But friends directed his interest toward things like 240SXs and RX-7s, but only for him to combine both genres by way of small-blocks stuffed into almost every single one of them. It's not as though Will's got anything against things like SR20DETs or 13B-REWs, it's just that, for him, the LS makes a whole lot more sense. "Honestly, I don't have much experience with rotary engines besides general maintenance," he says. "When I bought my FD, it came with multiple plastic bins of what was once a complete 13B-REW that had blown coolant seals and was completely disassembled. Not knowing much about them and coming from a hot rodding background, I ripped the soul out, as some purists say, and put an LS in it." And which is exactly what he went on to do with that FC of his, too. Will never planned on having an 1,100hp FC RX-7 with a Chevy V-8 under its hood. Nobody really does. "It was just [supposed] to be a fun daily driver," he says. "I've always liked the platform and I had a decent amount of parts left [over] from the different stages my FD went through." Planned or not, there are few better ways to go about decommissioning an otherwise perfectly fine daily driver especially when it ends up making about eight times more power than what you really need.

See how royal hairstyles have evolved over the years from loose curls in the 1920s to Markle's waves of 2019.

The world fell in love with Kate Middleton and her bouncy blowout, and then suddenly the popularity of blowout bars exploded across the world. Now we have Meghan Markle, who isn't afraid to wear her hair up, down, straight, curly, or in a messy bun.

BBUgeaU	autos	autossuvs	2019 Toyota RAV4: What You Need to Know	The fully redesigned 2019 Toyota RAV4 boasts a large cargo hold, a fuel-efficient engine, and plenty of driver assistance features. That's partly why it finishes in the top third of our compact SUV rankings.	The fully redesigned 2019 Toyota RAV4 boasts a large cargo hold, a fuel-efficient engine, and plenty of driver assistance features. That's partly why it finishes in the top third of our compact SUV rankings. Is the Toyota RAV4 a Good SUV? Yes, the Toyota RAV4 is a good SUV. It handles well, rides smoothly, and gets great gas mileage. Though some rivals are more athletic, this Toyota has ample power for most driving situations. It may not be the most upscale SUV in the class, but the new RAV4 has a good-looking interior with plenty of room for people and cargo. We named it our Best SUV for Teens $35K to $40K because of its lengthy list of driver assistance technology and its above-average predicted reliability rating. It was also named a finalist for our 2019 Best Compact SUV for Families award. Should I Buy the Toyota RAV4? The RAV4 is a definite contender in this class, but it also carries an above-average starting price. Some buyers may want an SUV with a stronger value proposition. In that case, you may want to check out rivals like the Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 . Neither can match the RAV4's predicted reliability rating (though they both have solid ratings), but both are worth exploring if you're looking for a small crossover SUV. Should I Buy a New or Used Toyota RAV4? Toyota rolls out a redesigned RAV4 for the 2019 model year. The 2019 model doesn't have quite as much cargo space as the outgoing model, but it's more powerful (by 27 horsepower) and more fuel-efficient (by about 4 mpg). New standard features for 2019 include a larger infotainment screen (7 inches, up from 6.1), Apple CarPlay, a Wi-Fi hot spot, traffic sign recognition, and driver drowsiness monitoring. For 2019 Toyota also drops the number of available RAV4 trims from six to five. You can potentially save thousands of dollars by shopping for a used RAV4, but you'll miss out on the redesigned model's upgrades. If you're interested in a used model, check out our reviews of the 2016 , 2017 and 2018 Toyota RAV4 , and browse our Used Car Deals page to learn about savings and discounts you can find on a used vehicle. We Did the Research for You: 25 Reviews Analyzed Our car reviews include everything you need to know before heading to the dealership. We combine the opinions of the automotive press with quantifiable data like crash test results and reliability ratings to form a complete picture of every vehicle we rank. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News Best Cars has been ranking vehicles since 2007, and our team has more than 75 years of combined experience in the automotive industry. Our car reviews are objective. To keep them that way, our editorial staff doesn't accept expensive gifts or trips from automakers, and a third party handles all the advertising on our site. How Much Does the Toyota RAV4 Cost? The RAV4 sports a base price of $25,500. That's one of the highest starting prices in the class. There are four higher trims, with the range-topping RAV4 Limited starting at $33,500. That's above average for the class, but it's in line with many competitors' upper-end prices. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Toyota dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Toyota deals page . Toyota RAV4 Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V? The Honda CR-V is an annual contender for the top spot in our compact SUV rankings. It's got a well-built interior, two rows of spacious seats, and more cargo space than almost every rival, including the RAV4. It offers plenty of features, including some the RAV4 doesn't, like Android Auto. The Toyota is a bit more powerful, however, and it gets slightly better gas mileage. These are both good SUVs, but the Honda provides more bang for your buck because of its lower starting price. Which Is Better: Toyota RAV4 or Mazda CX-5? The Mazda CX-5 is arguably the most athletic vehicle in the class. The RAV4 is a bit more fuel-efficient, but the CX-5 handles better and is definitely more fun to drive   plus, Mazda is introducing a turbocharged engine option for the 2019 CX-5. The Mazda also has one of the nicest interiors in the class, complete with two rows of spacious seats and lots of tech features. The RAV4 provides much more cargo space and a better predicted reliability rating, however. These are two good options, and you should let your personal preferences make the choice for you. RAV4 Interior How Many People Does the RAV4 Seat? This Toyota crossover seats five people. Whether you're up front or in the back, you'll have ample   though not class-leading   head- and legroom. The seats are comfortable as well, and they provide plenty of support for longer drives. RAV4 and Child Car Seats There are two full sets of LATCH connectors for installing car seats in the RAV4. The system earns the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's highest rating of Good+ for its ease of use. RAV4 Interior Quality The redesigned RAV4 has made noticeable strides in terms of interior quality. Its cabin looks clean and sleek, and there are plenty of soft-touch materials. There are still some hard plastics that keep this Toyota's cabin from ranking among the most upscale in the class, but this is still an attractive, well-built interior. RAV4 Cargo Space Though it doesn't have as much cargo space as the outgoing model, the 2019 RAV4 still provides more than most competitors. With the rear seats up, the RAV4 provides 37.5 cubic feet of cargo space   enough room for the family's vacation luggage or your tailgating gear. Fold down the rear seats, and you get 69.8 cubic feet of space. RAV4 Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation Standard features in the RAV4 include the Entune infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen, a USB port, Siri Eyes Free, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and a six-speaker audio system. Available features include a moonroof or panoramic glass roof, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless device charging, and an upgraded Entune system with an 8-inch touch screen, navigation, four additional USB ports, satellite radio, and an 11-speaker JBL audio system. The Entune infotainment system ranks among the best in the class. Its intuitive interface and responsive touch screen make it easy to use, and there are physical buttons for some functions as well. Though it doesn't offer Android Auto, Apple CarPlay is newly available. Read more about interior » RAV4 Performance RAV4 Engine: A Good Fit for This SUV This Toyota features a 203-horsepower four-cylinder engine. It's not as peppy as some rivals' turbocharged engines, and it's occasionally a bit loud, but it provides ample power and acceleration whether you're driving around town or on the highway. We cover the RAV4 Hybrid in a separate review. RAV4 Gas Mileage: Among the Best Hybrids notwithstanding, few compact SUVs can match the RAV4's fuel economy ratings. According to Toyota estimates, the RAV4 earns 26 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway. For comparison, the Honda CR-V gets 26 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway with its base engine (it gets slightly higher estimates with its optional turbo engine), while the Mazda CX-5 gets 25/31 mpg city/highway. RAV4 Ride and Handling: Easy to Drive With accurate steering and little body lean around turns, the RAV4 feels composed on drives across town and through curvy back roads. It generally rides smoothly, and few road imperfections are felt by occupants.

Whether you want a million-dollar view of a city skyline or an awe-inspiring natural landscape, these standout spots across the globe are sure to inspire wanderlust. Take a look and see what catches your eye. Stunning Vistas Even seasoned travelers will tell you that sometimes, they need to take a step back and drink it all in. Thankfully, the world is filled with jaw-dropping places to do just that ( and take a fabulous selfie , of course). Whether you want a million-dollar view of a city skyline or an awe-inspiring natural landscape, these standout spots across the globe are sure to inspire wanderlust. Landmannalaugar Iceland This otherworldly landscape is full of scenic panoramas and geological extremes. There are colorful rhyolite peaks, volcanic craters, and steaming hot springs. Neighboring black lava fields make the peaks stand out even more, especially at sunrise and sunset. During summer, hiking is popular, as are dips in the hot pools. While a trip to Iceland may sound pricey, there are ways to visit this Nordic country without spending a fortune . Golden Gate Bridge San Francisco Have you really been to San Francisco if you haven't stood in awe of the Golden Gate Bridge? You can cross the famed orange suspension bridge on foot or bike during daylight hours. For that incomparable sunset shot with San Francisco in the background, head to Battery Spencer in the Marin Headlands just north of the bridge. Taking in the famed landmark is just one of many fun cheap or free activities to enjoy in the City by the Bay . Burj Khalifa Dubai, United Arab Emirates Visit the observation deck at the world's tallest skyscraper for outstanding views of the humanmade splendor of Dubai, as well as the desert beyond. But don't miss the view at the bottom, too   the whole building often becomes a canvas for a spectacular LED light show , and the Dubai Fountain show below runs every half-hour at night. Closer to home are numerous other skyscrapers that also belong on your bucket list . Milford Sound New Zealand A cruise along this well-known South Island fjord yields loads of truly spectacular scenery: There are craggy mountains shooting straight up from the water, including famous Mitre Peak; stunning waterfalls; and wildlife galore, including fur seals, dolphins, and penguins. Hiking and kayaking are also popular here, but bring your poncho : The area gets plenty of rain. San Pedro De Atacama Chile Salar de Atacama, the biggest salt flat in Chile , lies just beyond this adobe village. Here you'll find huge pools of shallow water that reflect the Andes Mountains as well as stunning birds, including several kinds of flamingos. At night, the Atacama's clear skies and high altitude make the desert an ideal star-gazing location. Taj Mahal India The panorama of north-central India's Taj Mahal and its long reflecting pool is one of the most iconic in the world. Get up early to be among the first to enter the grounds of this massive marble mausoleum and take comparatively uncrowded photos, or venture across the Yamuna River to the Mehtab Bagh Gardens and snap some sunset pictures in relative peace. Peggy's Point Lighthouse Nova Scotia, Canada No list of gorgeous views is complete without a lighthouse standing proud on a rugged, rocky shoreline. Built in 1915, the Peggy's Point Lighthouse in Nova Scotia fits the bill and is among the most photographed lighthouses in Canada. Scramble over the rocks to savor the scenic coast and explore the equally photogenic fishing village of Peggy's Cove while you're there. Cinque Terre Italy It's hard to find a corner of the Cinque Terre that isn't irresistibly picturesque. Made up of five seaside villages on the Italian Riviera, you'll find pastel buildings threatening to spill into the sea, bustling harbors, steep stairs and narrow lanes. If you're looking for postcard-worthy pictures, don't miss the gorgeous harbor at Vernazza. Bagan Myanmar Gazing upon the ancient Buddhist temples of Bagan , many built between the ninth and 13th centuries, will transport you to another time. There are more than 2,000, many of which are open for exploration. There are several hills and platforms that allow views of the whole area, or travelers with deep pockets can splurge on a hot-air balloon. The Twelve Apostles Victoria, Australia Views of this stretch of the southeastern Australian coast can put most others to shame. The "apostles" are actually limestone pillars that rise imposingly out of the ocean, cut off from the cliffs on the mainland by the forces of wind and water. Experienced hikers can save the Twelve Apostles as the finale for the eight-day Great Ocean Walk along the coast. Lion's Head Cape Town, South Africa Located between Table Mountain and Signal Hill, Lion's Head is well known for its striking 360-degree panorama: Gaze down upon all of Cape Town on one side, and Table Mountain and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. During a full moon, take an hourlong hike to the top for a striking and unique perspective. Machu Picchu Peru This breathtaking Incan empire was built atop the Andes Mountains. Called the "Lost of City of Incas," the combination of intense landscape, archeological sites, and excellent trekking conditions has earned Machu Picchu the reputation as one of most beautiful places in the world. Get there on the famous Inca Trail, or take a train and a bus without breaking a sweat. Antelope Canyon Arizona Once you've tired of the stunningly grand vistas at the Grand Canyon, get a far different take on the desert. To the north is Antelope Canyon, the most visited slot canyon in the American Southwest. The surreal landscape was formed by flash floods rushing through sandstone. Seeing the rays of light shooting through Upper Antelope Canyon is worth the drive alone. Hallstatt Austria If any town on Earth reaches fairytale levels of perfection, it's the small village of Hallstatt . Wedged between the mountains and an alpine lake, Hallstatt has it all: the cobblestone center square, timber-framed baroque buildings with generous flower boxes, and a beautiful church with a tall steeple. Take a boat tour for the best views. Pamukkale Turkey The stunning white travertine terraces of Pamukkale   that's "Cotton Castle" in Turkish   are deposits left over from the area's abundant hot springs. Though sunset is especially picturesque, anyone who wants to splash in the pools should go in the morning to beat the crowds. If the terraces aren't enough for you, there are also remains of an ancient Greco-Roman spa city to explore. Rainbow Mountains China Layers of mineral deposits have formed the spectacular spectrum of colors in these mountains, found in the Zhangye Danxia Landform Geological Park in north-central Gansu province. Several viewing platforms inside the park allow awesome views of the colorful, undulating peaks, which are particularly stunning at sunrise and sunset. Victoria Falls Zambia No single photo can do Victoria Falls justice. The Zambezi River tumbles more than 350 feet here, and rainy season can send more that 500 million cubic meters of water over the edge each minute. There are several awe-inspiring vantage points: One of the best is from a stomach-churningly high pedestrian span named Knife Edge Bridge. The water is most forceful from April to June, but that also means there's an intense spray from the falls. Easter Island Chile Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, has long been a source of stunning but mysterious views for travelers who make it out to this isolated Pacific island , more than 2,000 miles from the Chilean coast. Breathtaking panoramas of the famous half-buried moai statues await on the slopes of Rano Raraku volcano and the Ahu Tongariki ceremonial platform. Deadvlei Namibia Striking Deadvlei presents a desert landscape unlike any other: spindly tree limbs from dead camel thorn trees shooting up through a white clay pan floor, silhouetted against towering golden-red dunes. One of those dunes, known as "Big Daddy," towers over most others at more than 1,000 feet tall. The truly ambitious can climb it for a panoramic view. Big Sur California You'll have your pick of stunning views in Big Sur , along California's rugged northern coast. Most Pacific Coast Highway travelers pull over at the iconic Bixby Bridge, one of the most photographed spots in central California. Or head to Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and take a short hike to McWay Falls for a spectacular view of a massive waterfall meeting the beach. Oia Santorini, Greece Arrive early to the village of Oia , famous for its white hillside buildings and blue-domed churches, to watch the sun set into the azure Aegean Sea. Most evenings, crowds gather in the streets and around the crumbling castle on the town's highest point to watch the fiery orange-red burst meet the blue sea. Tiger's Nest Bhutan This monastery, also known as Taktsang , clings to the cliffs thousands of feet above the Paro Valley in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. Though it can be viewed from afar, the more adventurous can follow a steep trail and visit the temples themselves, where views of the valley below are spectacular, too. Lençóis Maranhenses Brazil No, it's not a mirage: In the summer, dazzling freshwater pools form between the sugary white sand dunes of this obscure national park in northeastern Brazil, creating a landscape like no other. Visitors can climb the dunes and swim in the pools at will, and those who really want to splurge can take a scenic flight over the area. Avenue of the Baobabs Madagascar This humble dirt road on Madagascar's western coast is downright otherworldly thanks to its collection of rare, 800-year-old baobab trees . Their massive trunks are more than 150 feet around, and root-like, spindly tops give them an unmistakable silhouette, especially against the rising or setting sun. Uluru Northern Territory, Australia Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, is a massive sandstone formation that rises suddenly and imposingly from the barren Australian outback. Until October of 2019, visitors could trek to the top if weather permitted, though a permanent ban is now in place at the request of indigenous peoples. Paths around the base remain, and visitors can even dine under the stars after watching the sun set on Uluru . Athabasca Falls Alberta, Canada Experience the beauty of these surging falls in Jasper National Park from several different walkways and bridges. Considered the most powerful falls in all of Canada, Athabasca has a beautiful mountain backdrop and plummets into a gorge below. Bring a waterproof jacket no matter the weather   you'll probably get sprayed. Pikes Peak Colorado Ascend more than 14,000 feet on the Pikes Peak Cog Railway for views that inspired Katharine Lee Bates to write "America the Beautiful" in 1893. You can bike, hike, or drive to the summit, but we prefer to sit back and enjoy the scenery. In autumn, the golden aspens are particularly striking. Skellig Michael Ireland Now famous for being Luke Skywalker's hideout in recent "Star Wars" movies, Skellig Michael is a place like no other. Eight miles off the coast of County Kerry, you'll climb ancient stone steps to dizzying heights to find a monastery built sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries. Sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean and the Irish coast await at the top, too. Wahiba Sands Oman Close your eyes and imagine a line of camels trekking over the unending dunes of an Arabian desert: That's what you'll see in real life at Wahiba Sands in Oman. Though there are a sprinkling of tourist camps, the windswept dunes are how they should be: spectacular in their emptiness. If you're up for something more exciting, try dune-bashing in a four-wheel drive. Plitvice Lakes Croatia Stroll along the miles of wooden footbridges of Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park to gaze at the blue-green water of more than a dozen lakes, countless cascading waterfalls, tall cliffs, and the lush green tree canopy. Boats and buses also allow weary walkers some time off their feet. Christ the Redeemer Rio de Janeiro This iconic Art Deco statute is nearly 100 feet tall, and its outstretched arms span more than 90 feet. While the statue itself is certainly worth a closer look, its dramatic perch on 2,310-foot Mount Corcovado provides stunning views of Rio de Janeiro and its beaches, famous Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Atlantic Ocean. Volubilis Morocco The extensive Roman ruins at Volubilis, silhouetted against mountains beyond, are among the most atmospheric you'll find anywhere. This partially excavated city includes intricate mosaics, a basilica, an aqueduct, and plenty of storks that like to roost on the ornate columns. Go at sunrise or sunset to wander the ruins at their most photogenic. Preikestolen Norway Preikestolen, or the Pulpit Rock, soars nearly 2,000 feet above Lysefjorden, a fjord in southwestern Norway. Enjoy the expansive view of this glacially carved landscape from the top of Preikestolen by making a four-hour round-trip hike, or simply enjoy gazing up at the rock and its stunning surroundings from a cruise on the fjord. Clingmans Dome Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee The Smokies are nowhere near the tallest or most dramatic peaks in the world, but they are still among the most evocative, especially when shrouded in their trademark mist. The 360-degree observation platform atop 6,643-foot Clingmans Dome offers some of the best views in the region: Visitors can even see more than 100 miles on a clear day. Note that the road to the platform is closed from December through March. Charles Bridge Prague Prague's historic center is so picturesque that it's hard to take a bad photo, but if you want extra insurance, head for Charles Bridge . Walk east on the bridge for an iconic view of Prague's many spires, Old Town Bridge Tower, and the span's captivating sculptures. Turn around for stunning views of Prague Castle. Lake Kawaguchiko Japan This peaceful lake is lovely to behold in its own right, but it's best known as a prime viewing spot for Mount Fuji , one of Japan's most iconic sights. Cherry-blossom season in April and changing leaves in the fall can lead to particularly dramatic photos, but note that clouds often hide the mountain, especially during the middle of the day. Laguna Colorada Bolivia Parts of it blood-red from algae and other microorganisms, Laguna Colorada in southwestern Bolivia definitely stands out against its backdrop of the Andes' brown peaks. Adding even more interest to this exceptional view: blindingly white borax deposits and rare high-altitude puna flamingos. Anse Source D'argent Seychelles Want some beach photos that will make everyone back home seethe with envy? Anse Source d'Argent , a beach on La Digue island in the Seychelles, has a dreamlike quality thanks to its powdery sand, turquoise water, and massive boulders. Protected by a coral reef, the water is shallow, clear, and perfect for snorkeling and frolicking. Bryce Canyon Utah The dizzying clusters of sandstone spires in Bryce Canyon, known as hoodoos, set this spot apart from so many other dazzling southwestern landscapes. You'll find the best views of the hoodoos and other significant formations such as Boat Mesa at Sunrise Point , a trailhead for easy or moderate journeys down into the rocks. Arc de Triomphe Paris Sure, you can climb the Eiffel Tower for a great view of Paris, but climbing the 284 steps to the top of the Arc de Triomphe allows an even better city vista , including of the tower itself. The leafy Champs-Élysées is another Paris highlight . Go when the sun is starting to set to see the City of Lights sparkle. Giant's Causeway Northern Ireland The sight of around 40,000 hexagonal basalt columns jutting up from the shore of Northern Ireland's County Antrim is at once puzzling and dazzling, especially in the waning afternoon light. Visitors are free to hopscotch among the stones or head up for broader view along the clifftop Giant's Causeway Coastal Path. Erawan Falls Thailand Tucked in Erawan National Park in western Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, Erawan Falls is a feast for the eyes. Water tumbles over slick rocks into blue-green pools under a jungle canopy while monkeys swing from the trees. The falls are made up of seven tiers , so adventurous visitors can hike up as far as they like: The higher you go, the more unspoiled your photo and views. Mrs. Macquarie's Point Sydney Don't miss this little peninsula, part of the city's lovely Royal Botanic Gardens, where visitors can amble around and take in some of the best views of Sydney's iconic skyline and harbor, including the famous Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Points of interest include Mrs. Macquarie's Chair , carved out of stone by convicts in 1810. Perito Moreno Glacier Argentina This 19-mile-long blue-white sheet of ice rises more than 200 feet from the water in southern Argentina's Los Glaciares National Park. Several viewing platforms and walking paths allow plenty of spots for photographs. Up for a true splurge? Companies will gladly take you on a glacier trek that lets you walk on the surface. Haleakala National Park Hawaii It's worth getting up early to drive the winding roads and watch the sun rise above the clouds at Maui's Haleakalā National Park . The view of the sunrise from the summit of this dormant volcano is breathtaking. Though the fee is nominal, you'll have to make a sunrise reservation in advance, since the park is trying to better manage crowds. Calton Hill Edinburgh, Scotland You can't miss Calton Hill, rising from the Edinburgh city center with an Athenian-style acropolis and various other monuments to explore. However, the views of Old Town Edinburgh stretching out below are what make this short, scenic walk worth it. One of the best panoramas? The view of Castle Rock from the back of the Dugald Stewart Monument . Hidden Lake Glacier National Park, Montana The scenery in Montana's Glacier National Park is breathtaking no matter where you look. For some dazzling photos and a good sense of what the park has to offer, try the short hike to the stunning, mountain-ringed Hidden Lake that starts at Logan Pass Visitor Center. You'll probably spot mountain goats and marmots in the alpine meadows. Campanile di San Marco Venice, Italy Peering out from the top of the 325-foot bell tower of St. Mark's Basilica affords visitors a breathtaking view of Venice's domes, red roofs, twisting alleys and iconic canals with the Adriatic Sea beyond. During summer, visitors can buy tickets online to skip the often-long lines for this popular attraction. Bonus: There's an elevator. Lake Atitlán Guatemala Guatemala's lovely Lake Atitlán is ringed by three volcanoes and itself fills a caldera formed by an eruption tens of thousands of years ago. For a relaxed way to enjoy the view, grab a meal at one of the many lakeside cafes in Panajachel. For a not-so-relaxed way to enjoy an even more spectacular view, you can hike to the top of 9,900-foot Volcano San Pedro. Kerry Park Seattle Seattle's skyline is truly something special. It has it all: Twinkling city lights, an iconic man-made landmark (the Space Needle), the gorgeous Puget Sound, and (on a clear day) a snow-capped Mount Rainier in the distance. Kerry Park , a small public park on Queen Anne Hill, offers a postcard-perfect view of the scene. Go at sunset for particularly breathtaking light, and linger to see the city light up.

BBHriZh	autos	autossuvs	2018 Chevrolet Traverse Review: A Civilized Traveler	A large, all-occasion family hauler that stands tall among tough competition	Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site. The redesigned Chevrolet Traverse delivers room, comfort, and connectivity, providing a civilized alternative to full-sized SUVs and a credible challenge to established three-row competitors. It shows grace and composure on the road that belies its length and overall size, handling curvy pavement with agility. The ride is comfortable; the suspension quietly smooths bumps in the road. Aided by a nine-speed automatic transmission, the easygoing V6 engine has plenty of power at the ready for merging and passing. The Traverse is one of the quicker three-row SUVs we've tested, covering the 0-to-60 mph sprint in 7.3 seconds. It's easy to get into the cavernous interior, which features wide, accommodating seats front and rear. The third-row seat is low and tight but tolerable if you slide the second-row chairs forward a notch. The controls are easy to operate with large, legible buttons. The MyLink infotainment system takes center stage with its colorful, intuitive screen and lots of cool features. Despite its modern cabin appointments, the Traverse's interior ambience feels low-rent for its price, reinforced by the clunky manual roof sunshade. A rear-seat reminder designed to prevent drivers from leaving a child behind is standard, but only the top trims have automatic emergency braking. Read the complete Chevrolet Traverse road test .

BBUlE3c	news	newspolitics	2020 Democratic presidential candidates: Joe Biden is the only Democrat left running for president. These are the others who were once in the race.	The 2020 election Democratic field is taking shape, with candidates revealing their intentions on a seemingly everyday basis. View the list of who is running for president.	The 2020 Democratic presidential primary field is down to one. Sen. Bernie Sanders has ended his presidential campaign, leaving only former Vice President Joe Biden remaining from the once-crowded pack. Here's an updated look at all the candidates who were once in the race. For the latest 2020 election news, check out CNN's full coverage . Announced campaigns Former Vice President Joe Biden AGE: 77 STATE: Delaware KNOWN FOR: Biden's long-anticipated announcement marks his third presidential campaign after he passed on a 2016 run. His name recognition, decades of experience and ties to former President Barack Obama are seen as his greatest assets. But his track record on -- and public response to -- making some women uncomfortable with his behavior could be an obstacle to gaining modern voters, some of whom may also think that the party needs new, more diverse representation. Dropped out Sen. Michael Bennet AGE: 55 STATE: Colorado (Dropped out February 11, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Bennet, the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools, was forced to hold off on entering the race following a diagnosis and subsequent treatment of prostate cancer in April. Having served in the Senate since 2009, Bennet pitched himself in pre-campaign appearances and speeches as a pragmatic lawmaker who has a progressive voting record. Bennet's candidacy sputtered from the outset, with the Colorado senator failing to qualify for the majority of Democratic debates or to gain traction among voters in key states. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg AGE: 77 STATE: New York (Dropped out on March 4, 2020) KNOWN FOR: The former New York mayor entered the race in late November as a moderate alternative to Biden, highlighting his extensive experience as NYC's mayor and the campaign funds he put toward key Democratic issues such as the climate crisis and gun control in past elections. His campaign briefly gained traction amid Biden's early struggles, but he faltered after widely criticized debate performances and questions over his past support for stop-and-frisk policing practices . He dropped out after he only won the American Samoa in the critical Super Tuesday contests. Sen. Cory Booker AGE: 50 STATE: New Jersey (Dropped out January 13, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Booker, who gained national recognition during his tenure as Newark's mayor before being elected to the US Senate, ran for president aiming to restore a sense of community and mend the moral fabric of America. But his fundraising paled in comparison to that of the top-tier Democratic candidates, limiting his capacity to expand his campaign team and advertise on television. Gov. Steve Bullock AGE: 53 STATE: Montana (Dropped out December 2, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Bullock, who served as Montana's attorney general before being elected governor in 2012, failed to convince the party's base that the best way to defeat Trump was by nominating someone who can win in a red state. Bullock, who is term-limited as governor, will not take on Republican Sen. Steve Daines in 2020, his spokeswoman said. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg AGE: 38 STATE: Indiana KNOWN FOR: Known locally in South Bend, Indiana, as "Mayor Pete," Buttigieg served as a naval officer in Afghanistan. Buttigieg's run was historic . He is the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president, and he broke barriers by becoming the first gay candidate to earn primary delegates for a major party's presidential nomination. He ended his campaign on March 1, 2020 after his performances in Nevada and South Carolina, two states where Buttigieg finished significantly behind the race's front-runners. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro AGE: 45 STATE: Texas (Dropped out January 2, 2019) KNOWN FOR: The son of a Chicana activist, Castro served as mayor of San Antonio in 2009 and served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration. The only Latino in the 2020 field, Castro ran an unabashedly progressive campaign over the last year, staking out left positions on issues like immigration, housing and policing. But the former secretary failed to gain traction in the large field of Democratic candidates and struggled to raise enough money to stay solvent. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio AGE: 58 STATE: New York (dropped out September 20, 2019) KNOWN FOR: The two-term New York mayor has enjoyed success on several largely progressive issues such as universal pre-K, raising the minimum wage and a low murder rate during his tenure. But he failed to resonate in the polls and was criticized for neglecting his duties as mayor to run for president, most notably during a brief blackout in Manhattan in July which happened when he was campaigning in Iowa. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney AGE: 56 STATE: Maryland (dropped out January 31, 2020) KNOWN FOR: A self-made businessman, Delaney at one point was the youngest CEO on the New York Stock Exchange. Delaney was the first candidate to officially enter the race when he declared his candidacy in July 2017, but he failed to gain name recognition and make his moderate message break through. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard AGE: 38 STATE: Hawaii (dropped out March 19, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Gabbard ended her campaign in March. She is the first American Samoan and the first Hindu member of Congress and brought her experience as an Iraq War veteran to the House Armed Services Committee. But she was not able to overcome obstacles both old and new, including internal campaign turmoil and her controversial secret meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand AGE: 53 STATE: New York (dropped out August 28, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Gillibrand, who centered her campaign on women's equality, ended her White House bid in late August as she was on the cusp of failing to qualify for the third Democratic primary debate. Her campaign saw her embrace increasingly progressive stances on immigration and gun control that ran counter to positions she had held when running for the House. Despite Gillibrand's high profile position, she failed to break out from the crowded primary field, with her campaign polling under 1% nationally when she exited the race. Sen. Kamala Harris AGE: 55 STATE: California (dropped out December 3, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Harris, a former California state attorney general and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, held progressive stances supporting " Medicare for All " and marijuana legalization . The senator, who struggled to energize her campaign in recent months, acknowledged that she was forced to unexpectedly drop out because of money. "I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete," she said. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper AGE: 67 STATE: Colorado (dropped out August 15, 2019) KNOWN FOR: As the head of Colorado from 2011 to 2019, Hickenlooper helped steer the state through several tragedies , including the 2012 shooting in a movie theater in Aurora that left 12 people dead and catastrophic wildfires and floods in 2013. Hickenlooper, who framed his candidacy around stemming the leftward lurch of the Democratic Party, dropped out in mid-August and launched his Senate campaign. Gov. Jay Inslee AGE: 68 STATE: Washington (dropped out August 21, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Inslee, who has held elected office for much of the last three decades, has been an outspoken progressive executive since he became governor in 2013. He has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump, including suing the President after he tried to ban immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Inslee dropped out as it appeared he wouldn't make the stage for the third round of debates. A day after he exited the 2020 race, Inslee announced he would seek a third term as Washington's governor. Sen. Amy Klobuchar AGE: 59 STATE: Minnesota (dropped out March 2, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Klobuchar announced her run outdoors as it snowed, which she tied to her commitment to a "homegrown" campaign with "grit." The Minnesota moderate looked to work across the aisle and win back fellow working-class Midwesterners. But her path to the nomination all but closed after she posted sixth place finishes in Nevada and South Carolina, a sign that the Minnesota senator's surprising showing in New Hampshire would not be nearly enough to propel her towards the nomination. Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam AGE: 45 STATE: Florida (dropped out November 20, 2019) KNOWN FOR: The child of Jamaican immigrants, Messam is a first-generation American and first black mayor of Miramar. His campaign held progressive views on guns, immigration and the environment. He was part of a group that sued the state of Florida in 2018 over a law that restricted his ability to create municipal gun regulations after he wanted a new amphitheater in his city to be a "gun-free venue." Despite failing to gain traction in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Messam said, "my state of Florida will be ground zero and I intend to be a factor to mobilize our state for the Democratic Party nominee." Rep. Seth Moulton AGE: 41 STATE: Massachusetts (dropped out August 23, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Moulton, a Marine veteran and three-term congressman , raised his national profile after trying and failing to prevent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from reclaiming the speaker's gavel. He later voted for her after Democrats retook the House last year. Moulton's run for president lasted four months and ended in August after he failed to gain traction or make the Democratic debates. He plans to run for reelection to Congress and relaunch a PAC that aims to elect Democrats with service backgrounds. Former congressional candidate Richard Ojeda AGE: 49 STATE: West Virginia (dropped out January 25, 2019) KNOWN FOR: A former Army paratrooper, Ojeda served for 24 years , earning the rank of major and serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan. A 2016 Trump voter , he focused on school finance reform and issues facing the middle class before dropping out of the race in late January. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke AGE: 47 STATE: Texas (dropped out November 1, 2019) KNOWN FOR: O'Rourke ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in 2018 while serving his third term in the House. In August 2019, he took nearly two weeks off to be in his hometown of El Paso following a mass shooting that left 22 dead. The shooting led O'Rourke to call for a mandatory buyback of assault-style rifles, declaring during the third Democratic presidential debate, " Hell, yes , we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47." O'Rourke's poor fundraising played a key role in his decision to exit the presidential race, aides familiar with his decision to drop out said. O'Rourke told supporters in an email that he will not run for office next year. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick AGE: 63 STATE: Massachusetts (dropped out February 12, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Patrick, a two-time governor of Massachusetts, announced a late entry to the race in November 2019, reversing a previous decision to stay out. He hoped his regional connections in New England and appeal as the last African American candidate would give him a boost in the early voting states of New Hampshire and South Carolina. But ultimately, he was unsuccessful in raising money and breaking through as a moderate candidate in a crowded field. Rep. Tim Ryan AGE: 46 STATE: Ohio (dropped out October 24, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Ryan, whose district includes Youngstown, Ohio, entered the presidential race as a long-shot candidate with less name recognition than most candidates and a far smaller political network. He dropped out in late October after failing to gain momentum and announced he would run for reelection to the House of Representatives. He has become most known in Democratic circles for his opposition to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi retaining her leadership positions, though he later voted for her when Democrats elected her speaker earlier this year. Sen. Bernie Sanders AGE: 78 STATE: Vermont (dropped out April 8, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Sanders' democratic socialist platform gained significant traction during the 2016 primaries, when the independent senator who caucuses with Democrats ran against Hillary Clinton. His policy agenda includes various progressive proposals, many of which have been embraced by the Democratic Party, like expanding health care, broadening the social safety net and making higher education free. Sanders dropped out in early April, clearing Biden's path to the Democratic nomination. Former Rep. Joe Sestak AGE: 68 STATE: Pennsylvania (dropped out December 1, 2019) KNOWN FOR: Sestak, who ascended to become a 3-star admiral in the US Navy during a 31-year military career prior to his election to the House of Representatives in 2006, entered an already-crowded Democratic primary field in June hoping to leverage his naval career into a successful presidential campaign. He represented Pennsylvania's 7th District until mounting a pair of ultimately unsuccessful campaigns for the Senate in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Billionaire Tom Steyer AGE: 62 STATE: California (dropped out February 29, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Steyer has operated as a funding force in Democratic politics in recent years, bankrolling candidates and organizations that promote liberal causes, including the impeachment of Trump. The billionaire businessman exited the race after he failed to claim victory in South Carolina, a state he invested heavily in, hoping it would turn around his sputtering run. "I said if I didn't see a path to winning that I'd suspend my campaign. And honestly, I can't see a path where I can win the presidency," he said. Rep. Eric Swalwell AGE: 39 STATE: California (dropped out July 8, 2019) KNOWN FOR: The Democrat who represents California's 15th Congressional District entered the race as a long-shot candidate in a crowded field. A frequent critic of the Trump administration, Swalwell raised his profile by becoming a staple on cable television. He focused on combating gun violence, and traveled to Iowa in December with Cameron Kasky, who's a survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and a co-founder of March for Our Lives. Sen. Elizabeth Warren AGE: 70 STATE: Massachusetts ( dropped out March 5, 2020 ) KNOWN FOR: Warren was appointed as assistant to President Barack Obama and special adviser to the Treasury secretary in order to launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She was also appointed to a congressional oversight panel overseeing the $700 billion Trouble Assets Relief Program that was passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Warren centered her bid on a promise to wipe out corruption in Washington but ended her campaign following another round of disappointing finishes in primary contests across the country on Super Tuesday. Spiritual author Marianne Williamson AGE: 67 STATE: Texas (dropped out January 10, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Williamson is best known for being a spiritual counselor to Oprah Winfrey and has written several best-selling books, including her debut "A Return to Love." She called for "a moral and spiritual awakening in the country" with her campaign, but acknowledged on January 10, 2020 , that her effort will "not be able to garner enough votes in the election to elevate our conversation any more than it is now." Businessman Andrew Yang AGE: 45 STATE: New York (Dropped out February 11, 2020) KNOWN FOR: Yang is an entrepreneur who launched Venture for America, a fellowship program that aims to connect recent grads with startups. He wanted to give all Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 per month to address economic inequality. While Yang overperformed what many experts believed he would accomplish in the Democratic primary, his devoted following -- known as the Yang Gang -- was unable to propel him beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, defeats that largely thwarted the candidate's rise. Decided not to run Former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams ( took herself out of consideration on August 13, 2019) AGE: 46 STATE: Georgia KNOWN FOR: Abrams became a national figure in 2018 during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia. Despite publicly mulling a 2020 bid for months -- she told CNN in May "I'll probably jump in myself" if voter suppression isn't a top issue -- Abrams ultimately ruled out a presidential campaign to focus on her national "voter protection" program . Sen. Sherrod Brown (took himself out of consideration on March 7, 2019) AGE: 67 STATE: Ohio KNOWN FOR: A liberal populist, Brown won three terms in Ohio, a state that has been trending Republican in recent years. Brown would've offered Democrats a candidate who could reconnect with voters in the Midwest. Before deciding not to run, he had embarked on a "listening tour" that included stops in the four key early voting states in the 2020 primary. Former Attorney General Eric Holder (took himself out of consideration on March 4, 2019) AGE: 69 STATE: New York KNOWN FOR: Holder served as President Barack Obama's attorney general until 2015. Holder had told several Democrats -- and "The Late Show" host Stephen Colbert -- that he was "interested" in pursuing the nomination, but ultimately he opted not to launch a campaign. Former Secretary of State John Kerry (took himself out of consideration on June 10, 2019) AGE: 76 STATE: Massachusetts KNOWN FOR: Kerry served on the Cabinet during President Barack Obama's second term. Prior to that, he spent 28 years representing Massachusetts in the Senate, and was the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee. During an interview with Sky News, he ruled out another presidential run, saying he was "delighted" that Biden had gotten into the 2020 race. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (took himself out of consideration on April 17, 2019) AGE: 62 STATE: Virginia KNOWN FOR: McAuliffe previously served as governor of Virginia and chairman of the Democratic National Committee and has an extensive fundraising network. He opted instead to help coordinate the campaigns of Virginia's local and national Democratic lawmakers "to make sure that we are blue" for 2020. Sen. Jeff Merkley ( took himself out of consideration on March 5, 2019) AGE: 63 STATE: Oregon KNOWN FOR: Merkley, the junior senator from Oregon, has focused on holding the Trump administration accountable on immigration policy, specifically family separations at the southern border. He opted in March to devote himself to his Senate re-election campaign over the next two years. UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect CNN's official tally of the major Democratic candidates running for their party's nomination for president.

AA3gpLN	autos	autosnews	2004 Chevrolet Corvette Commemorative Edition	The Chevrolet Corvette C5 exits in grand fashion, however, in the form of an optional Commemorative Edition that celebrates Corvette's back-to-back class victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.	The Corvette has enjoyed a legendary presence and colorful history since its debut in 1953. The current, fifth-generation Corvette, now seven years in production, remains the most complete and potent Corvette package offered--though its reign will come to an end as a new, more aggressive sixth-generation car appears in '05. The C5 exits in grand fashion, however, in the form of an optional Commemorative Edition that celebrates Corvette's back-to-back class victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Available in Coupe, Convertible, and Z06 models, the Commemorative Edition emphasizes visual punch rather than power upgrades. Most notable is a special Le Mans Blue paint, the same hue used on the two C5-R contenders that returned to Le Mans this year and narrowly missed a three-peat class win at the famed endurance race. The Commemorative package includes a special Shale-colored interior; the seats incorporate Corvette cross-flags embroidered into the headrests. Also part of the mix are exterior badges acknowledging Corvette's Le Mans success. There's one bit of CE hardware-related news: The '04 Z06 gets a race-inspired option in the form of a lightweight carbon-fiber hood that weighs just 20.5 pounds--10.6 less than the standard unit. This hood is constructed of unique, single-direction fibers intended to eliminate waviness, a trait common on painted carbon fiber. Atop the paint are silver stripes with red edges, similar to the stripe package used as a Le Mans-only aesthetic on the C5-R race cars (GM won't run these stripes at the rest of the American Le Mans race series events). GM says this is the first time carbon fiber has been used for a major body panel in a mass-production vehicle. "We definitely have technology transfer from [C5-R] racing to production with the example of putting carbon fiber into a series production street car that people can afford," notes Corvette Chief Engineer Dave Hill. Apart from the Commemorative package for '04, the Z06 receives specific chassis tuning upgrades intended to deliver increased performance and more vehicle control--all with a smoother ride around town. Considerable attention was paid to refinement of the Sachs' shock valving in order to diminish the impact of yaw and roll, particularly in a series of tight corners. Ride/Handling Chassis Engineer Michael Neal states, "We reshaped the force-velocity curve to give more control, but not at the expense of ride. What the customer feels, particularly on a racetrack, is a more poised car. He doesn't have to wait for body roll to settle during transient maneuvers, so he can be aggressive hustling from one corner to another, particularly as they come in quicker succession." Added to the handling mix are stiffer upper control-arm bushings teamed with slightly softer rear anti-roll bar bushings to deliver flatter handling and more stability going into the corner, thus minimizing oversteer on corner exit. "If you want to fix oversteer at the back, you first need to fix it at the front of the corner," says Neal. Specifically, deterring oversteer requires generating a smoother entry, which, in the case of the '04 Z06, is noticeably easier compared with the '03 model. The chassis refinements and reduced vehicle weight have paid off, as the '04 Z06 recently joined the ranks of the select few volume-production vehicles to have broken the eight-minute barrier for lap times at the 170-turn, 14-mile-long Nuerburgring circuit in Germany, where Team Corvette performs development testing. This is a worthy accomplishment, considering that the exact same vehicle can then be driven cross-country in air-conditioned comfort, backed by a factory warranty. Hill's goal for the '04 Z06 was "to make it the quickest Corvette ever produced," sending the C5 out with a bang. That it is, and that he has. Corvette Showdown: C5-R versus Z06 At Michigan's GingerMan Raceway road course, we had the opportunity to have C5-R driver Ron Fellows (multiple world champion in Trans-Am, World Sports Car, and American Le Mans) compare hot laps in C5-R and Collector Edition Z06 Corvettes. First up was the new Pratt & Miller C5-R, undergoing final tuning for the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans. Familiar with the number 53 C5-R, Fellows blasted around the 1.88-mile road course in 1:15.07 seconds. With a Katech 7.0-liter V-8 pounding out over 600 horsepower (plus a six-speed sequential box, Goodyear slicks, and huge brakes), the C5-R delivered phenomenal, repeatable performance--just what you'd expect from a multimillion-dollar championship team entry. Next were some hot laps in an '04 Z06. Although it had been a few years since Fellows aggressively hustled a street car around a racetrack, his extensive experience in showroom-stock racing quickly emerged. With 405 horsepower delivered from the 5.7-liter LS6 V-8, the Z06 has the torque to easily overpower the Goodyear street tires. So Fellows maintained a keen focus on cornering smoothness. "I was surprised by the general balance," notes Fellows. On his third lap, he turned in an impressive 1:33.9-second time, proving the fortitude of the street-legal Z06 package. "To really get an appreciation of what this thing's capable of, you need a racing seat. I found myself being tossed around quite a bit--the cornering capabilities are that good."--J.K.

BBL0xLh	health	weightloss	If You're Trying to Lose Body Fat, Follow These 3 Experts' Advice	There's no one-size-fits-all method to losing weight or lowering your body fat percentage.	There's no one-size-fits-all method to losing weight or lowering your body fat percentage . The amount of body fat and weight you can lose in a given month will vary based on your current weight, diet, and activity level, to name a few variables that impact weight loss. To find out how much body fat and weight you can safely and realistically expect to lose in a month, POPSUGAR reached out to the experts. How Much Body Fat You Can Expect to Lose "Under the assumption that nutrition is 100 percent during this process, it depends on the weight and body fat of each woman," said Stephen Cheuk, certificate IV Australian Institute of Personal Trainers certified trainer and founder of S10 Training in New York City. He explained that a woman who is already relatively lean (18 to 28 percent body fat) and strength trains can lose anywhere from 0.5 to 0.8 body fat in a single week. "If a woman is on the heavier side in weight and has a higher body fat percentage (over 28 percent), she could lose a minimum of one percent body fat a week," Cheuk said. How Much Weight You Can Expect to Lose Pratik Patel , MS, RD, CSSD, CSCS, New York Giants director of performance nutrition and assistant strength and conditioning coach, told POPSUGAR, "If you can steadily lose anywhere from 1/2 pound to one to two pounds a week, you know you can control it." According to Patel, a realistic and healthy way to achieve this would be to implement a calorie deficit . One pound comes from about 3,500 calories, and if you eat 500 fewer calories than you burn from working out and other physical activity every day for a week, you'll be down one pound. By increasing this deficit to 750 calories a day for one week, you'll have lost one and a half pounds. Eating 1,000 fewer calories than what you burn with exercise will put you at a two-pound loss in a single week. This means that in a month you could lose anywhere from four to eight pounds. Patel explained that losing no more than two pounds a week will ensure that you're burning fat instead of breaking down your muscle tissue. Emmie Satrazemis, RD, CSSD, nutrition director at Trifecta , said, "Weight loss is strongly determined by one's age, starting body weight, their fitness levels, current body composition, and overall health." According to Satrazemis, people who have more weight to lose and who currently consume a high calorie diet may lose more weight and quicker because "it is easier to cut high amounts of calories from a diet that is high in calories to begin with." For sustainable weight loss, she recommends decreasing one's caloric intake by 15 percent and absolutely no more than 20 percent a day. She explained that going from eating 2,000 calories to 1,700 calories a day will result in a little over half of a pound of weight loss per week. "For some, losing one to two pounds a week is not realistic, while others may lose even more than that," she said. Emmie explained that consistent exercise can help you lose more weight but it may also increase your appetite . Because of this, she advises adjusting your caloric intake to accommodate an increased appetite. Remember, before making any changes to your diet, please consult your doctor.
AAARCpt	health	nutrition	12 Foods That Fight Anxiety and Stress, According to a Nutritionist	Dark chocolate is at the top of our list!	Dark chocolate is at the top of our list! 12 foods that fight anxiety and stress, according to a nutritionist For approximately 31% of Americans, anxiety can manifest itself as an debilitating disorder at some point in their life   women are almost twice as likely as men to develop one, according to the National Institute of Mental Health . Nearly anyone would admit they're overworked, stressed, exhausted, and burnt out   but changing what's physically on our plates may help us feel so much better. There's a growing body of evidence suggesting pathways in your gut may affect mental health and anxiety symptoms, adding weight to the role that the gut plays as a bodyguard to the rest of your immune and neurological systems. In addition to adequate therapy and treatments prescribed by your care provider, a wholesome diet can help boost the natural prowess of your GI tract and could serve as yet another way to help regular your mood. A large meta-analysis of randomized control trials published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine in 2019 found that adopting a healthier diet significantly reduced depressive symptoms associated with anxiety disorders   and the research also suggested that women especially reaped significant benefits in dietary interventions. Placing an emphasis on veggies, fruit, 100% whole grains, nuts, seeds, and unsweetened dairy products may benefit us in multiple ways at the biochemical level. But if you're wondering about those CBD edibles and drinks you're suddenly seeing everywhere , they may not help as much as you may think. There's insufficient reliable evidence regarding CBD dosing, safety, and the effectiveness for health conditions   and, technically, CBD is still considered illegal when used in food and beverages, until the Food and Drug Administration adds CBD to the "generally recognized as safe" list. According to FDA experts, CBD could potentially harm you by causing livery injury , affecting other prescribed drugs you may be taking, and could also be contributing to male reproductive toxicity. Another factor to consider: Your body can use only a fraction ( less than 20% ) of the CBD it digests, not to mention the fact that a 2017 study found that 26 percent of CBD products tested in a randomized trial contained less CBD than advertised. Products made with CBD, just like other processed offerings, may contain ingredients that'll make anything taste better, including added sugar , sodium , and saturated fat-filled oils. While there's no magic food that can "cure" or "treat" anxiety and depression (talk to your doc if you're concerned), there are a few shifts that we can make in our daily food choices that have been studied for mood-boosting properties. Assuming we all want to eat food that's delicious, nutritious, and safe, try more of the following picks instead. * With additional reporting by Jaclyn London MS, RD, CDN 1) Fermented Foods Fermented foods like miso, tempeh , sauerkraut, and kimchi contain probiotics , the friendly bacteria that live in your GI tract and help defend against harmful pathogens and microbes. Eating more probiotics can help take care of your gut microbiome, potentially benefiting that gut-brain connection. 2) Cherries Cherries contain antioxidants like quercetin, which can help promote feelings of calmness. Eating more fruits and veggies in general has also been linked to decreased symptoms of anxiety and depression and increased happiness levels. Some studies have shown that eating five or more servings per day helps boost mood, yet according to the Centers for Disease Control , only 10% of Americans hit that recommendation. 3) Dark Chocolate Its bitter flavor profile is polarizing for some, but promising research could tip the scales in favor of a frequent treat. A 2019 survey-based study published in the journal Depression & Anxiety suggests that people who eat dark chocolate regularly are less likely to report depressive symptoms. While more research is needed to confirm any causation due to the study's limited size, adding a small amount in your routine certainly can't hurt. RELATED: 10 of the Healthiest Chocolate Brands on the Market 4) Chamomile Tea Who doesn't love a cup of warm, soothing cup of tea after a long day? If you can, spring for chamomile: A 2016 clinical trial, with results published in the journal Phytomedicine , suggests that those who drank this tea over a long-term period "significantly" reduced severe generalized anxiety disorder symptoms. Chamomile's role in anxiety reduction may have something to do with it's ability to enhance your efforts to get to sleep on time . 5) Kiwi Some initial studies also indicate that the combo of vitamins C and E plus folate may help to reduce oxidative stress, which can lead to chronic inflammation. Plus, they may help to promote serotonin production, the neurotransmitter associated with well-being and happiness. 6) Seafood Seafood is another under-consumed food in the U.S. and there's early evidence to support adequate intake (8-12 ounces per week) with a cognitive boost and mood enhancement due to the essential omega-3 fatty acids. Try adding more salmon, mackerel, sardines, and shellfish to your plate, or algal oil if you're vegan or vegetarian. RELATED : 30+ Easy Salmon Recipes to Make for Dinner Tonight 7) Avocado This nutrient-packed fruit is filled with vitamin B6 and magnesium , a combo that may help with serotonin production in your brain. Adding avocado slices to omelets, salads, and even smoothies will also help you get more fiber and healthy fats in your diet. RELATED: 20+ Amazing Avocado Recipes 8) Beans and Legumes Chickpeas , lentils, beans, and legumes also provide antioxidants, vitamin B6, and magnesium. They're protein-rich powerhouses, so try them as a swap for red meat in sautés and in stir-fry dishes 9) Plain Greek Yogurt Yogurt provides key minerals that may help with symptoms of stress and stabilize mood, but it also provides probiotics. Look for plain, unsweetened versions with at least five strains of live and active cultures on the ingredients' list to use in breakfasts, snacks, and dips. 10) Whole Grains Prebiotics , meanwhile, fuel your body's probiotics so they can survive and thrive. Find them in 100% whole grains like oats, barley, and bran, as well as various fruits, vegetables, and beans. Eating more of these foods helps serotonin receptors in your GI tract function properly and they've been linked to reducing risk of chronic disease. RELATED: 11 Healthiest Whole Grains You Should Be Eating 11) Milk It may sound like an old wives' tale, but there's some science behind the time-honored glass of milk before bed. A cup of milk provides minerals like calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Magnesium in particular has been studied for its role in anxiety   yet 68% of Americans aren't getting enough of this mineral. 12) Pumpkin Seeds An ounce of pumpkin seeds provides nearly 20% of your daily value of magnesium, plus potassium. Sprinkle these seeds (and nuts, like walnuts, peanuts, pistachios, and cashews) on your meals or snack on 'em plain for a nutrient boost.
AAAMySP	health	weightloss	These Low-Calorie Snacks Will Fill You Up, Boost Your Energy, and Squash Cravings	Bring on the dips! Hummus, guac, and more.	Bring on the dips! Hummus, guac, and more. It happens like clockwork: Almost every day at 3 p.m., your stomach grumbles, signaling that it's time for a snack. While it may be tempting (and easy) to grab a bag of chips from the vending machine, you'll only be doing your body a disservice when the energy crash hits moments later. But if you do it right, snacking can be healthy and downright good for you, according to dietitians. When you load up on a balance of protein , fiber , and healthy fat, you'll stabilize your blood sugar, tamp down cravings, and feel less ravenous during your next meal. If you want to keep your snack on the lower end of the calorie spectrum, aim for about 200 calories, 10 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fiber , Sarah Pflugradt, R.D. , nutrition expert and author of You Get One Body , recently told Prevention . Not sure where to start? Check out the dietitian-recommended, low-calorie snacks below. They're packed with filling nutrients to create a healthy, satisfying bite and they're all about 200 calories or less! 1) Greek yogurt and berries If you're craving something creamy and sweet, reach for your tub of yogurt in the fridge. A serving of plain Greek yogurt topped with a handful of berries is a protein-rich, fiber-filled snack, says Tamara Duker Freuman, M.S., R.D., C.D.N., author of The Bloated Belly Whisperer. The berries lend a natural sweetness, while Greek yogurt provides gut-boosting probiotics . 2) Tuna salad and veggies This twist on a tuna salad sandwich is lighter but just as satisfying. "Mix a 3-ounce can of tuna with low-fat mayo or a bit of mashed avocado," says Freuman, then pair it with cucumbers or nestle the mixture in endive leaves. You'll get filling protein from tuna and tons of fiber from the veggies. Shop Now 3) Lentil soup Who says a snack can't be leftovers? If you'­re craving something warm and filling, opt for a cup of lentil soup, which is loaded with plant-based protein and fiber to keep you full, says Freuman. And since lentil soup is a melting pot of spices, you'll feel satisfied with all the delicious flavors coming through in your dish. Shop Now 4) Guacamole and broccoli Trade in tortilla chips for broccoli florets, either raw or steamed when you need a crunchy fix, Ilana Muhlstein, M.S., R.D.N., creator of 2B Mindset , suggests. "Many grocery stores now sell refrigerated or frozen broccoli florets that can be steamed in the microwave, making it easy to prepare at your workplace," she says. 5) Banana whip This play on a whipped mousse packs a big punch of protein. Mix a serving of plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt with 1/4 banana sliced and two tablespoons of powdered or regular peanut butter, then top it all with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon , suggests Muhlstein. "When stirred together, this snack tastes like a whipped mousse or cheesecake, and it's the perfect choice for those times when you won't be eating your next meal for a while," she says. 6) Goat cheese and pears In the mood for something cheesy? Try pairing 1 ounce of salty goat cheese with fiber-rich pear slices for a sweet and savory snack that tastes more decadent than it is, says Freuman. If you can't find or don't like pears, reach for an apple instead. 7) Hardboiled eggs and a side of fruit When you can't decide whether to go salty or sweet, have both. Pair a hardboiled egg with a serving of melon or your favorite fruit, says Freuman. The protein in the egg will fill you up and melons have a high-water content, giving you a hydrating energy boost . 8) Dry-roasted chickpeas Instead of reaching for a bag of chips, try dry roasting a big batch of chickpeas . Add your spices to them, like cumin, black pepper, and paprika, or make it sweet with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of honey. Then, portion them out in 1/3 cup and munch on them alongside a piece of fruit or a handful of raw veggies, says Freuman. Shop Now 9) Lox with cream cheese on crackers Revamp your bagel order with this lower-carb, yet filling version. Top a few whole-grain crackers (Freuman's favorite is Scandinavian-style whole-grain crispbreads) with cream cheese or another spreadable cheese spread, a slice of smoked salmon, and a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning or fresh herbs. Voila, snack time just go more sophisticated! Shop Now 10) Caprese skewers Eating on a stick not only helps with portion control but gives you another interesting, creative way to enjoy your food. Combining mozzarella balls with fresh basil leaves and cherry tomatoes offers a nice balance of protein, fiber, and fat in one snack. 11) Almonds with a side of fruit Almonds are a good source of healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making them a go-to, low-calorie snack. Enjoy a serving of these nuts with a piece of fruit for additional fiber and sweetness without the sugar crash, says Freuman. Keep a bag of almonds in your purse, gym bag, or desk drawer for easy access. Shop Now 12) Cottage cheese and veggies Cottage cheese is an underrated protein superstar, with about 10 grams of the macronutrient in a half-cup serving. It also takes well to a variety of flavors, so you can pump up your dip with your favorite spices and herbs. Serve them with some crudite for dunking, and you've got a healthy, low-calorie snack in seconds. 13) Vegan queso and veggies If you love nachos, this healthy twist gives you the cheesy flavor you crave minus the extra saturated fat and calories. "I recommend looking for dairy-free queso at health-food stores. They're low in calories but taste very decadent, so it's a satisfying snack that's good for you, too," says Muhlstein. Many vegan queso dips include nutritional yeast, which is B-vitamin-packed yellow powder that many vegetarians and vegans use to impart a cheesy flavor in dishes. Pair it with your favorite raw or steamed veggie. Shop Now 14) Celery sticks with peanut butter This childhood favorite is just as enjoyable as a busy adult. Stick to 2 tablespoons of peanut butter (or your favorite nut butter) and enjoy with plenty of crunchy celery sticks, says Freuman. Just be sure to read the ingredient labels carefully when choosing natural nut butters; many sneak in added sugar for taste. Shop Now 15) Chia pudding Chia seed pudding will fill you up fast when you're hankering for something creamy and sweet. These tiny but mighty seeds pack protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Mix chia seeds with a milk base (low-fat cow's milk or unsweetened nut or soy milk, for instance) and pop it in the fridge to set (typically overnight), then give it some natural sweetness with a few fresh mango or banana slices, says Freuman. 16) Turkey roll-ups Nitrate-free, low-sodium deli meat make a great, low-calorie snack when you're in a pinch. Wrap a few slices of deli turkey meat around cucumber or pickle spears with a touch of mustard for extra flavor, says Freuman. It's a hit of lean protein that's heavy on flavor, making it satisfyingly filling. 17) Apple slices and nut butter You can't go wrong with peanut butter and apples. This timeless snack delivers lean protein, healthy fats, and carbs for fast energy, making it a good snack to enjoy before a workout. Simply smear a serving of your favorite nut butter on crisp apple slices, says Freuman. 18) Egg whites and veggies If you have time to whip up a quick snack, consider an egg white-and-veggie scramble or omelet. Top egg whites with your choice of seasoning and some veggies for a low-calorie protein boost to keep you full until your next meal. Or, pair it with your favorite raw veggies for a burst of freshness, says Muhlstein. You can even buy liquid egg whites at the supermarket and microwave a serving in a cup for an easy office snack. 19) Cinnamon ricotta This low-calorie snack feels more like dessert, thanks to ricotta cheese's creamy decadence. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon and unsweetened cocoa powder for a sweet and nutritious treat, says Freuman. 20) Banana and peanut butter Creamy, protein-packed peanut butter perfectly complements potassium-rich banana slices. This power combo makes a great snack after a tough workout because it helps replenish energy quickly. And it tastes like childhood! 21) Hummus and veggies Hummus has a bit of protein and fiber (thanks to its chickpea base) but what will really fill you up are the hearty veggie dippers. Reach for fiber-filled carrots , hydrating celery, or vitamin C -rich bell peppers. 22) Hot chocolate milk If sipping a smoothie just won't do it for you, consider a warm mug of hot chocolate: Heat a cup of low-fat milk or unsweetened dairy-free milk and add some unsweetened cocoa powder for an ode to hot chocolate, says Freuman. 23) Faux PB&J Enjoy a deconstructed peanut butter and jelly sandwich by dipping fresh grapes, strawberries and other fresh fruits in a serving of peanut butter. If you're wishing for the bread, make it an open-faced snack, using whole-grain crackers just remember to keep it at 200 calories or less! 24) Fruit and cottage cheese When you want something sweet and savory, pair cottage cheese with some fresh fruit. Cottage cheese offers a boost of protein, while berries deliver antioxidants and fiber to keep hunger at bay. 25) Ricotta cheese and tomatoes Behold lasagna's low-calorie cousin: 1/2 cup low-fat ricotta topped with fresh tomatoes and an optional sprig of basil. This healthy, low-calorie take will satisfy pasta cravings minus the heavy carbs. 26) Kale chips Making kale chips is easier than you think. Simply wash kale leaves thoroughly with water and pat them dry. Then, lay them on some parchment paper over a baking sheet. Sprinkle with some nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, and other spices and pop them in the oven. The result is a crunchy, savory snack! 27) Popcorn Popcorn can be a healthy snack when you don't smother it in butter. Instead, cook popcorn over stovetop and flavor it with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. For a healthier alternative to kettle corn, add a drizzle of pure maple syrup and a dash of ground cinnamon. Shop Now 28) Oatmeal You can't go wrong with a warm bowl of oatmeal or chilled overnight oats. Oatmeal's slow-digesting carbs will help keep hunger at bay and help stabilize blood sugar for sustained energy. Enjoy it with some fresh fruit and granola for a satisfying snack. 29) Rice cakes with avocado Yes, you can have avocado toast for a snack! Using rice cakes or crackers instead of bread helps cut down the calories, while still keeping you full and satisfied from the creamy, healthy fats. 30) Dark chocolate and almonds This sweet and crunchy snack combo will quell your cravings for a chocolate bar . Unlike a sugary granola bar, enjoying a piece of dark chocolate with some almonds helps keep portion sizes and sugar in check.

You want the bad news first, right? The 2016 Jaguar F-Type outfitted with a manual transmission is OK. Great? Naw. Adequate? Sure. I mean, it's a row-your-own H-pattern six-speed. How bad could it be? And it's not bad. It just sorta is. I'm not entirely sure what I expected from the addition of a manual transmission, but I'm always in the mood to be wowed. I wasn't, and I'll try and explain why. Bombing toward the extreme western edge of continental Europe -- a rocky outcropping near Sintra, Portugal, called Cabo da Roca -- it hit me that I'd held this particular stick before. But where? Then, on a quick 3-2 downshift where I missed second and the lever wound up banging against a dead spot I call a "ghost detent," it hit me. This is the same plug-n-play ZF unit used by BMW for the 335i. Ropey, rubbery, but mostly old-feeling, this particular manual is out of step with the otherwise contemporary Jaguar. The shifter's fine, and that's about the nicest thing I can say about it. See, people aren't buying manuals. Pick from the litany of reasons why not, but they just ain't. So why would Jaguar bother introducing a manual option into the lineup? Why does Porsche make a Targa? A convertible GTS with AWD, along with 20 (or so) other variants of the 911? Because it might sell a few. Keep casting that net wider and wider and you're sure to snare a couple more fish. Buying a sports car isn't exactly a logical decision to begin with, and making sure (wealthy) customers' every possible whim is satisfied makes good business sense. As AMG's Tobias Moers said to me about his company's upcoming GT variants, "[The 911 is] a good role model. Those guys know how the segment works." Therefore on the one hand, I think it's great that Jaguar's bothering with a manual F-Type. Even better, it will be cheaper than the eight-speed automatic version. But on the other hand … A fundamental mistake Jaguar makes with the F-Type manual is this: Who buys manual transmissions these days? Driving enthusiasts. What do (most) driving enthusiasts crave, besides a manual transmission? Power, and loads of it. You know what makes loads of power? The F-Type R's 550-horsepower, 500 lb-ft of torque, supercharged V-8. Can you get the F-Type R with a manual transmission? No, and therein lies the rub. Now, Jaguar's not totally alone here. The most powerful 991s are dual-clutch only affairs: the Turbo, Turbo S and GT3. Thing is, ZF doesn't make a manual transmission that can handle the power of the blown V-8. The only supplier that does is Tremec -- the TR6060 can handle a max of 600 lb-ft of torque, or slightly more for Hellcat duty -- and I doubt it could even fit in the F-Type. Plus, as you're about to read, all F-Type Rs will be AWD within a year, meaning that there's simply no way to bolt in an off-the-shelf unit. As Donnie Brasco advises, fuhgeddaboudit. But hey, if you want a coupe or convertible supercharged V-6 F-Type with a manual, happy days are here. One word of caution, tempered by the fact that I was driving an early build, pre-production unit: Under heavy throttle input the transmission slips. Dump the third pedal, floor it, and you can feel the clutch slipping against the engine's copious torque. You can smell the burning, too. Hopefully this is simply a pre-production issue, and doesn't mean the ZF box can't handle the instant supercharged torque. Now the good news. We also got to play with pre-pro versions of the AWD F-Type on the old Estoril F1 circuit. Job well done, Jag. I've been (ridiculously) lucky enough to have been assigned both of Motor Trend's long-term F-Types (the 380-horse V6 S convertible first, followed by our current Coupe R). Moreover, I've spent a good deal of time behind the wheel of the V8 S. For the first time ever I found myself fully able to bury the throttle without fear of massive, butt-first-into-a-tree oversteer. The sex cat now grips, and that equals confidence. Confidence leads to faster laps, part of what owning a sports car is all about. Four wheels driven will also help with acceleration. However, seeing as how we've clocked the Coupe R to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds and through the quarter mile in 11.8 seconds at 122.3 mph, being quicker is hardly an issue. How does the new all-wheel-drive system work? Pretty much exactly how it works on the AWD XF and XJ. On the left side of the transmission there's a PTO (power take-off) that sends a relatively thin prop shaft (or as us Yanks say, drive shaft) forward to the front differential. There's an electronic clutchpack that in normal driving is open, allowing 100 percent of the torque to hit the rear diff. Then comes the black magic. Depending on conditions the central clutch can vary the amount of power sent to the front wheels. The max it can send is 50 percent (and I kid you not, it took a full 10 minutes for Jaguar to give us that answer), but it's complicated. Under launch conditions, the computer routes about 30 percent of the gumption to the front wheels. During cornering, maybe 20 percent. Maybe more, and maybe less. It's up to IDD (Intelligent Driveline Dynamics) to decide the appropriate amount, and the system makes that decision in 150 milliseconds. Basically, if you're sitting on patch of ice and floor it, the torque is then split 50/50. Also new for the 2016 F-Type is Jaguar's take on EPAS (electronic power-assisted steering). During the presentation we sat through a song and dance about how Jaguar has been working on EPAS for half a decade but hedged on releasing it until it was good enough. I interpreted that to mean until tightening emissions regulations forced their hand. Thing is, it's bloody good. If you take a gander at the XE First Drive story, I mentioned how that car's EPAS steering is particularly incredible. On the new F-Types, the new steering is just pretty good, not revelatory. At low speeds you can still drive over fairly major road imperfections and not feel the steering wheel budge. That's a lack of feedback that hydraulic-assist steering aficionados so desperately crave. On the track, the feedback is wonderful. Back to the track, specifically the wet track. Jaguar started us off on a compact, water-soaked autocross course. The cars were V6 models set in water/snow mode (essentially, that equates to a lazy throttle mapping) and everything was turned on. They also placed a driving instructor/snitch in the car to make sure we didn't change any of the settings. Still, the AWD proved very impressive. You could go nearly WOT out of corners and the car tracked straight and true. Sure, if you overcooked it then the back end would go all squirrely for a second before the nanny caught the car. As I mentioned, I've driven F-Types in wet conditions and they never previously behaved this way. Honestly, you can't even power out of corners in the dry. On to the main event, which was the big-dog R models on the main circuit. Yeah baby. I went on the launch of the F-Type Coupe in Spain where Jag stuck us on a racetrack in the then new RWD Coupe R. Not good. The back end was just all over the place and I found myself constantly babying the throttle post-apex. We ranked the Coupe R ninth place out of 10 contestants in last year' Best Driver's Car because of the fear of constant oversteer. Frank Markus describe it as "Carl Lewis in stilettos," one of the all-time most appropriate metaphors. The Salsa Red long-term Coupe R I have stewardship over is currently quarantined in our garage because after 13,000 miles the rear tires are so worn down that they no longer hold air. Obviously, something had to give. Jaguar never came out and admitted it, but the F-Type, especially in crazy powerful V-8 form, doesn't handle the way it should. It certainly doesn't handle as well as the Porsche 911 or the Chevy Corvette, the Brit's most obvious competitors. AWD cures this particular disorder and that's why starting with the 2016 model year, all Rs will be AWD. Notice I didn't just say all Coupe Rs, as the V8 S is no more. In 2016 the V-8 convertible gets the R badge and motor and all the (550) horsepower that entails. I got to drive both the hard and soft-top R models, as flat-out as I could on a track I've never been to before, and my conclusion is thus: Hallelujah! All-wheel drive is just what the doctor ordered, even though it adds 175 pounds of weight. Nissan's GT-R has shown us time and time again that worrying about lightness is overrated. As Randy Pobst is so fond of saying, the F-Type R finally "puts the power down!" Sure, smoky burnouts are a thing of the past, and maybe, just maybe, existing V-8 cars have a shot at becoming highly sought-after collectors' items. Hey, I said maybe! I should also mention that on the track, the carbon-ceramic (and quite expensive) brakes are noticeably better. Not just in terms of fade, but stopping power, too. Let's summarize: Come 2016 Jaguar will have 14 F-Type variants to sell you. Coupe and convertible V-6 models in two states of tune (340 or 380 hp), with either RWD or FWD, and your choice of a manual transmission, as long as you opt for the RWD V-6. You can also get the tarmac-stomping R model in either Coupe or Convertible form. That adds up to 10 variants. Meaning that similar to "Battlestar Galactica," there are four more to be revealed. My guess? Something akin to a GT3 competitor, similar to the XKRS-GT. Just a hunch. All F-Types are switching over to EPAS, which improves mileage and lowers the weight with no noticeable "feel" penalty. It's hard without the two versions side by side to say that one type of steering is better, but I can say it would be a hair-splitting victory either way. Also, the hood has been redesigned for pedestrian safety standards, and there are some new optional body kits called Sport Design Packs -- essentially a new front fascia, sills, and rear diffuser cover. They look pretty good. More importantly, the F-Type remains as gorgeous as ever. The real takeaway is that in regards to the F-Type, Jaguar has embarked on a path of continuous improvement. It seems unwilling to leave good enough alone. That's wonderful news, and similar to how that one car company in Zuffenhausen takes care of business.

AAuOQ0L	autos	autosenthusiasts	Lightning Lap 11.5: We Lap the Ford GT at VIR!	The Ford GT at VIR is, in one word, fastest. As in, fastest-lap-we've-ever-recorded fastest.	The Ford GT's currency is speed, traded on the exchanges of ACO, WEC, and IMSA. Based on the asking price, its brokers the 1000 hand-picked applicants who will be allowed to buy the car over the next four years should have the means to make a track day happen. Whether they choose Virginia International Raceway's 4.1-mile Grand West Course thrill ride is up to them. For us, it is the obvious choice. We've been lapping cars there for more than a decade; we brought the GT to VIR now because we couldn't secure one to run in 2017's Lightning Lap 11, and we wanted to make this car part of the official record. The GT at VIR is, in one word, fastest. As in, fastest-lap-we've-ever-recorded fastest. Take the GT anywhere else and you'd miss out on 163.6 mph down the front straight (second-highest all-time speed to the 170.6-mph Porsche 918 Spyder); barreling into the Climbing Esses at 148.0 mph (a new LL record); and a neck workout at 1.17 g's in Turn 1 brought to you by the entertainment firm of EcoBoost, Michelin, and Multimatic spool-valve dampers. Put it together and you get a 2:43.0 lap, fast enough to dethrone the 918 Spyder as the LL king. And this was accomplished in one day with the car. Given our normal three-day exposure, that time would drop, potentially by entire seconds. This Ford has a character that isn't polished smooth like a European exotic or sledgehammer subtle like an American V-8; it's somewhere in between. The 3.5-liter mill sounds like a truck engine very Viperish but spins to redline as if it were cast in the forges of Maranello, not Cleveland. With the carbon-fiber wheels fitted, the steering is very light on-center, and feedback from the otherwise perfectly weighted electrohydraulic steering is amplified. A rather aggressive tire stagger promotes limit understeer, and it's easy to modulate the car's cornering attitude with the long-travel throttle. In its lowered Track mode, the chassis is stricter than a yardstick-wielding nun, who, coincidentally, could measure the driver's eye height because the roof is now but 41.7 inches off the ground. Headroom is an issue. Driving slumped to avoid contact between helmet and the headliner that hides the steel roll cage isn't initially comfortable, especially when braking at 1.25 g's on the back straight accompanied by the thud-sursh as the rear wing forcefully tips itself forward in air-brake mode. We feared our day was done when we dropped the right-rear wheel over the curbing at the exit of Spiral and destroyed an underbody brake duct; this item passes above the tarmac with a mere 2.7 inches of clearance. But Ford's mechanic referred to the scoops as "wear items." He seemed serious and not concerned with the reduced cooling. Then there was an intermittent hydraulic warning that turned out to be nothing but a software glitch. Also, right-hand corners induced fuel starvation. Ford can't seem to re-create the fuel issue, but on-site corporate talent confirmed the stumbles. So we made sure to lap with a full tank. The first time we took a crop of cars to lap VIR, Ford's '06 GT was the quickest thing on hand. It was a retro take on a 1960s prototype, and its lap of 3:00.7 set an early high bar. The only thing that car shares with today's GT is a brake-fluid reservoir. Unlike the friendly, effortlessly hurled '06, the new GT is brutally fast and forgoes nearly all comforts in its quest for speed and cornering agility. The Competition Series GT weighs even less and likely will go quicker. We've already requested a three-day loan for when Lightning Lap 12 rolls around.

AAvKoOa	autos	autosreview	2012 Dodge Avenger: What You Need to Know	The 2012 Dodge Avenger has poor fuel economy and critics were disappointed with its limited passenger and cargo space.	The 2012 Dodge Avenger has poor fuel economy and critics were disappointed with its limited passenger and cargo space. The 2012 Dodge Avenger is ranked: #19 in 2012 Affordable Midsize Cars #104 in Used Midsize Cars under $15K Reviewers said the 2012 Dodge Avenger's standard four-cylinder engine struggles to get the car up to cruising speed. Most preferred the available V6 engine, which they said offers plenty of power. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard and a six-speed automatic is available. The four-cylinder Dodge Avenger gets an EPA-estimated 21/30 mpg city/highway, which is low for a midsize car. The V6 model, on the other hand, gets 19/29, which is typical for a V6-powered in the class. Test drivers said the Dodge Avenger has a comfortable ride, even over rough pavement. Apart from the brakes, which some critics said are weak, reviewers agreed that the Avenger offers poised handling, with controlled body motions during cornering. The 2012 Avenger impressed reviewers with its soft-touch interior materials. However, they said the cabin seems cramped for the class, with small front bucket seats and a narrow rear bench seat that doesn't offer much legroom. At 13.5 cubic feet, the Avenger's trunk is also small for an affordable midsize car. Critics said that some of the Avenger's interior features, like the map lights and the turn signal stalk, seem poorly made. Standard features include a tilt and telescoping steering wheel and a four-speaker audio system. Available features include automatic climate control, leather upholstery, navigation, satellite radio, Bluetooth phone and music streaming, a USB port and an upgraded Boston Acoustics audio system. Other Cars to Consider The 2012 Hyundai Sonata gets excellent fuel economy, and reviewers said that its base four-cylinder engine delivers impressive acceleration compared to other cars in the class. Test drivers reported that the Sonata has an attractive, modern cabin design with high-quality interior materials and plenty of legroom in the back seat. At 16.4 cubic feet, the Sonata's trunk is one of the largest in the class. The four-cylinder 2012 Chevrolet Malibu gets good fuel economy for a midsize car, and critics appreciated the Malibu's attractive interior design, spacious front seats and decent rear-seat legroom. The 2012 Malibu also has a larger trunk than the Avenger. Read the full 2012 Dodge Avenger review on U.S. News & World Report for more details, photos, specs and prices.
AAw0UUH	finance	finance-saving-investing	Warren Buffett's advice for a stock market crash	Stock market crashes are inevitable. But there's no reason to fear them.	Stock market crashes are inevitable. But there's no reason to fear them. Why you should heed Buffett's advice If you could only listen to one person's advice during a stock market crash, let that person be famed investor, Warren Buffett. Not only will the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO's advice serve you well, but his knack for keeping a clear head -- and even getting a bit greedy (more on that later) -- when everyone else is selling, may make his the only advice you need to navigate uncertain times. Indeed, Buffett's ability to tune out the noise and remain optimistic amid these downturns has played a vital role in his unrivaled performance over decades. Between 1965 and the end of 2017, Berkshire's market value has increased at an annualized rate of 20.9%, more than doubling the S&P 500's average annual growth of 9.9% during this same period. This 20.9% annualized growth rate for Berkshire's market value translates to a total return of 2,404,748%, obliterating the S&P 500's 15,508% gain during the same time frame. Notably, this performance was achieved amid a number tumultuous financial periods, the 1973-74 stock market crash, Black Monday, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a sharp pullback after the September 11 attacks, and the more recent Great Recession between December 2007 and June 2009. Suffice to say, Buffett knows a thing or two about stock market crashes. So, without further ado, click ahead for some advice from the Oracle of Omaha regarding inevitable market downturns. ALSO READ: 6 Things That Could Cause a Stock Market Crash This piece was originally published by Microsoft News on April 18, 2018. 1. Stocks can fall far -- and they can fall fast When investing in stocks, there's always a risk that a major downturn is right around the corner. In fact, stocks not only fall often, but they're totally unpredictable. As Buffett said in his most recent shareholder letter , "There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period." Consider some of this data from Capital Research and Management Company on the frequency of large declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1948 and December 2017. A similar study of the period between 1945 and July 2016 showed that the S&P 500 fell 5% to 9.9% 56 times, 10% to 19.9% 21 times, 20% to 39.9% nine times, and 40% or more three times, according to CFRA Research (via American Association of Individual Investors). Stock market declines are inevitable -- and they will come in all shapes and sizes. Be prepared. 2. Avoiding leverage will give you greater clarity To be able to make good decisions amid a stock market crash, investors will need to be able to remain calm. As Buffett has said, "Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ. Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing." While there's no guarantee investors will be able to resist irrational and emotional urges that could lead to bad decisions during a downturn, there's one way that makes poor judgment a near certainty when things go awry: trade on margin . Debt distorts all decision making in investing -- especially during a stock market crash. Buffett explained this in his most recent shareholder letter: "Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren't immediately threatened by the plunging market,your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions." 3. Don't try to time the market Don't try to forecast when stock market crashes will occur. Just know they will come. In Berkshire's 2017 shareholder letter, Buffett outlined four times when Berkshire stock fell 37% or more, representing what he called "truly major dips." The biggest decline occurred from March 1973 to January 1975, when Berkshire stock declined a whopping 59%. "In the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table," Buffett said about these four major declines. "No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow. These pullbacks, which were all accompanied by broader drops in the stock market, are undoubtedly painful for investors. But no matter how much you wish to avoid them, trying to time them is a fool's errand. 4. Don't view stocks as ticker symbols To help maintain a clear head during stock market crashes, investors should remember that they are business owners -- not ticker symbol owners. While stock prices may plummet, the majority of companies with good business models and strong competitive advantages will likely see a far smaller negative impact to their underlying businesses during these periods. So, be sure to detach stock price performance from business performance. Buffett elaborated on this concept in Berkshire's most recent shareholder letter: "Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses,not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their 'chart' patterns, the'target' prices of analysts or the opinions of media pundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be) our investments will be successful as well." ALSO READ: Will Inflation Cause the Next Stock Market Crash? 5. Stay invested While stock market crashes and major downturns have proven to resurface time and time again throughout history, an even stronger trend has been the powerful wealth-building returns of stocks over time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, has risen an average of 10.3% annually over the last 100 years when including reinvested dividends. Don't be that person that liquidates their portfolio during a recession. In fact, be the person that is keeping most -- if not all -- of their portfolio invested. Buffett explained the importance of staying invested in Berkshire's 2012 shareholder letter: "Since the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it's a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out of it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of 'experts,' or the ebb and flow of business activity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it." 6. Go shopping Even better than not selling stocks during a recession is to actually go on the offense. In bull markets, investors can occasionally find reasonably priced, wonderful businesses. But they can rarely find wonderful businesses trading at a significant discount to their fair value. Stock market crashes are the rare times when high-quality businesses can be found in the clearance aisle. Go shopping! As Buffett has famously said,"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful." Or consider a more recent quote from Buffett: "When major declines occur … they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped by debt." 7. Stay focused on the long haul Don't get caught up in near-term economic forecasts or the popular headlines of the time, whether those are ones of sheer optimism or gloom and doom. Investors are not traders. They are business owners with long-term views. So, remain focused on the long haul during downturns. Buffett explained this concept in Berkshire's 2017 shareholder letter: "Stocks surge and swoon,seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value.Over time, however, Ben Graham's oft-quoted maxim proves true: 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.'" ALSO READ: 4 New Pieces of Wisdom From Warren Buffett In a nutshell: Remain calm and be patient Last but not least, embrace some of Buffett'soptimism , exemplified in a quote from Berkshire's 2012 shareholder letter: "American business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied to business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game that is heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20th Century, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression and many recessions. And don't forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the century as well.)" Stocks have survived depressions, recessions and corrections in the past, and they will survive them in the future. So, if you find yourself amid a stock market crash, stay out of debt, stay focused on the long-term, and take advantage of buying opportunities. Every downturn will eventually turn back upward.

The 2010 Volkswagen Tiguan is one of the more upscale offerings in the 2010 compact SUV class, and its refined, agile handling and excellent safety scores make it a strong choice for those looking for a sporty crossover. The 2010 Volkswagen Tiguan is ranked: #4 in 2010 Affordable Compact SUVs #5 in 2010 Affordable SUVs with 2 Rows #9 in 2010 Affordable Crossover SUVs #17 in Used SUVs with 2 Rows under $15K #18 in Used Crossover SUVs under $10K #19 in Used Compact SUVs under $15K When it was new, critics liked the Tiguan for its nimble handling and ample engine power, which they said makes it feel quite zippy for an SUV. They also enjoyed its interior, which has comfortable and spacious seats in the front and back. Powering the Tiguan is a 200-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine that most critics said provides good power. Either front- or all-wheel drive is available with an automatic transmission. A manual transmission is only available with front-wheel drive base models. Fuel economy is not the Tiguan's strong suit. An automatic transmission-equipped Tiguan with either drivetrain gets 18/24 mpg city/highway, which is fairly low for the class. Manual transmission-equipped models average slightly better, but these models might be somewhat difficult to come by. Inside, the Tiguan's cabin earned lots of praise for its comfortable, spacious seats all around, as well as its upscale, high-quality materials and good fit and finish. If you're looking for a near luxury interior, the Tiguan is a good bet. Maximum cargo space with the rear seats folded is 56.1 cubic feet, which is fairly low for the class. The Tiguan comes standard with cloth seats and an eight-speaker stereo with an auxiliary input jack. Upper trims and option packages add features like leather seats, navigation, a 10-speaker Dynaudio stereo, Bluetooth, satellite radio, dual-zone climate control, a power sunroof and a backup camera. Other Cars to Consider If you're considering the Tiguan, you may want to look into the 2010 Subaru Forester as well. It doesn't offer the luxury or refinement of the Tiguan, but critics said its interior offers plenty of space and comfort. It also has a more expansive cargo area, which may make it a better choice for families. Another 2010 compact SUV worth considering is the 2010 Chevrolet Equinox. The Equinox has more cargo space than the Tiguan, as well as a flexible interior with back seats that slide back and forth to accommodate either taller passengers or more cargo. Keep in mind that it isn't as luxurious as the Tiguan, but most critics said it offers plenty of comfort in all of its seats.

BBUuibK	travel	ustravel	The Best Things to Do in Austin	All the things that continue to keep Austin weird.	All the things that continue to keep Austin weird. In Austin you're in "The Live Music Capital of the World," (apologies to Nashville ) but there is plenty to fill your itinerary in between sets. Lace up your sneakers, because much the best of Austin happens outside. Stroll public art installations, and visit revitalized waterside parks, natural swimming holes, and a pride of peacocks by day; then watch the famous Austin bat colony fly as the sun sets (everyone has to do it once) by night, preferably with a good drink in hand. You'll still have time to shop for a pair of cowboy boots before a two-stepping dance lesson set to a live show. Here, the best things to do in Austin. Click the link to read our complete Austin travel guide. Congress Avenue Bridge Let's start big picture. What's the story here? Crowds gather nightly on the Congress Avenue Bridge at sunset to watch Austin's urban bat colony fly out from their home on the underside of the bridge. (Another popular viewing area is the lawn at the nearby offices of the Austin American-Statesman .) Any standout features or must-sees? The spectacle is one of those quirky, only-in-Austin happenings. (Note that it's seasonal, typically from May through October; during the winter, the bats migrate elsewhere.) The colony of Mexican free-tailed bats is the largest in an urban environment in North America about 1.5 million bats take flight each night to feed (on pesky insects like mosquitoes, making the animal a local hero). The bats fly in impressive formation for about 45 minutes. Is it easy to get around? The bridge, which crosses over Lady Bird Lake, is an easy-to-find Austin landmark. If you'd rather not walk to the bridge, you can pay for parking at the American-Statesman , which has a free observation area. There are also boat cruises centered on bat-watching. That sounds cool. All said and done, what and who is this best for? Even though the flight goes for 45 minutes you get the idea in under five. If you can pair your viewing with another activity downtown not difficult, as this part of town is extremely lively it's worth making time to watch the bats. The Continental Club What's this place all about? For as big as its reputation is, this dimly lit dive bar is surprisingly small on the inside. Posters and old photographs framed on the wall between neon bar signage tell this legendary club's story. Austin as a city is casual; this bar personifies that. So who's there? The crowd varies based on the show, but everyone is here for the nightly live music. Drinks are of secondary importance to the act. How are the drinks then? They are...fine. Order a bottled beer or a can of Lone Star to fit in with the mellow crowd. (Not to mention it gets crowded so it just feels easier to order a beer and make room for other patrons.) Did the staff do you right? There's little conversation when the performer is on-stage, but the bartenders know their drinks and are efficient. Wrap it up: what are we coming here for? This place is internationally acclaimed for the big names that play surprise late-night sets and for helping to popularize emerging musicians. Styles range blues, jazz, rock, country as does the cover charge. Bar Peached What do you notice when you walk in? Bar Peached walks the line between down-to-earth homey, and whimsical fun. There's a photo of Lady Bird Johnson over the fireplace, cactus wallpaper, shiplap on the walls, and bright colors in the 13-seat bar. There's also a fantastic patio featuring a historic heritage tree and a porch that whisk you away from West Sixth traffic. How's the crowd? It's a mix of all kinds, including families with kids; it's a cool neighborhood-y bar that doesn't push an overly adult theme. The design helps it to feel more comfortable for all ages, and lots of people love the outdoor patio and porch spaces for sipping cocktails (the bar's main focus). How are the drinks? Cocktails are where Bar Peached experiments. A few examples: the Margarita de Peached with habanero and Thai basil-infused tequila, the Yoga and Chill (vodka, lime, cucumber water), and Kyoto Kiss (gin, raspberry, yuzu, shishito, egg whites). Whether you like gin, tequila, vodka, sparkling wine, rum, mezcal, or bourbon, you'll find a well put-together cocktail. They also have beer, cider, mead, sake, and wine (red, white, sparkling, rosé). Do they have food as well? Bar Peached originated from The Peached Tortilla team so there are great snacks and real meal options from brunch to dinner, like chili crab toast, kale tempura, mapo Bolognese, confit duck foldies, Malaysian fried rice, and shaved ice desserts. How was the staff? They're generally friendly, approachable, and relaxed. Wrap it up: what are we coming here for? Bar Peached is a neighborhood hangout with plenty of outdoor space to sip bright cocktails and drinks with your significant other, kids, or group of friends. It feels like you've been welcomed into a backyard house party. Blanton Museum of Art You just walked in, what do you see? Guests enter the museum, located on the edge of The University of Texas' campus, through a series of archways. As you enter the lobby, the first thing you see is an installation in the two-story atrium: Reflective, acrylic panels in ombre shades of blue cover the walls and staircase to create a submerged-in-water feeling. What will we find here? The collection is compact but does an excellent job covering numerous visual art genres: early Renaissance paintings, Roman-era pottery, modern works housed in the contemporary gallery, a vast collection of prints, and Native American and Latin American works. The collection is well-paced and not overwhelming. A small series of sculptures is housed in a round rotunda. Contemporary works are showcased in gleaming white gallery spaces; skylights brighten more traditional, hardwood-floored spaces lined with Italian paintings. There are rotating exhibits, sometimes from big names like Ellsworth Kelly or Andy Warhol, in video, photography, paper, and print. What did you make of the crowd? The Blanton Museum of Art is a teaching museum, so there are always university students in the galleries. And though it's the largest museum in Austin, it's rarely crowded beyond travelers who know and appreciate art. Gift shop: obligatory, inspiring or skip it? The brightly lit gift shop is located across the courtyard from the main building. The inventory is funky and thoughtful but there aren't a ton of items that tie to museum's collection. There is jewelry by local artists, a dedicated kids' section, scarves, glassware, and even some clothing, plus plenty of Texas souvenirs. Is the café worth a stop, or should we just plan on going elsewhere? The café offers quality casual bites (the flatbread pizzas and sandwiches are stand-outs) and totally reasonably priced wine by the glass. Any advice for the time- or attention-challenged? You could take in several memorable pieces in an hour. It's impossible to miss Teresita Fernández "Stacked Waters," the ombre-effect installation in the atrium. Cildo Meireles' "How To Build Cathedrals" is an interactive installation created from a staggering number of coins. You can also take in Andy Warhol's Farrah Fawcett, who studied art at the university. And some of the more out there pieces include the "We Belong Here" neon signage, which is much-Instagrammed, and a portrait of notable African American businesswoman Madam C.J. Walker made entirely of small hair combs. Franklin Barbecue What are the bullet points we need to know? A heavyweight in Austin's barbecue scene , Franklin draws lines that are as epic as their brisket, which has earned accolades from almost every famous meat eater in the world. Take a tip from the regulars: bring a collapsible chair and show up at 8 a.m. You can preorder so you can enjoy every meaty morsel without the line, but you have to do it at least six weeks in advance (the wait is also an experience in itself, which is something to consider). Once you're finally inside this lunch-only restaurant, the no-frills turquoise-walled space says casual with a capital C it may just inspire you to wear a bib. What' the crowd like? Due to its fame, Franklin's clientele is as unpredictable as Texas weather. Travelers line up beside regulars, college students, and food bloggers, but everyone shares a common love for barbecue. To keep the crowd wrangled, Franklin posts this brief code of conduct patrons must abide by to be served: Stay civil, hungry diners. What do they have to drink? It would be sacrilegious to serve barbecue of this caliber without beverages to match, so Franklin stocks the bar with a rotating selection of local beers (Blue Owl, Hops & Grain, Live Oak), $14 buckets of Lone Star, and cans of Underwood pinot noir and pinot gris as a gesture for the wine folk. __Main event: the food. What should we order? __ Chef Aaron Franklin's smoky, slow-cooked goodness is served by the pound or sandwich-style. Whichever way you're going, the fatty tender brisket is the golden ticket here, though the pulled pork or ribs come in a close second. If you have room for dessert, the bourbon banana and pecan pies are to die for. And the service? The staff here has to run a tight ship. There's no time for small talk with this many mouths to feed, so they do everyone a favor and keep it moving quickly. Any final tips? Any die-hard barbecue lover must make the pilgrimage here at least once in their lives. Just be sure you plan ahead come early, come during the week, and be patient. It's worth it. Barton Springs Municipal Pool Let's start big picture. This massive public swimming pool, fed by a natural spring, is one of Austin's most prized outdoor settings. It's situated in well-kept Zilker Park, which has plenty of shade and lawns for sunbathing. The water temperature is a cool 68 degrees year-round, making it a respite during extremely hot summers and perfectly pleasant in winter, as well. Any standout features or must-sees? This is a fantastic place to immerse yourself in Austin's culture. It's never rowdy portable speakers aren't permitted, nor are coolers with outside food and drink. Instead, you may catch the beat of an informal bongo circle or see a yogi posing as the sun sets. A line forms at the moss-covered diving board, and below, millennials lounge on unicorn floats. Men, ironically dressed in Speedos, spread out on serape-striped rugs along the pool's lip. The pool is also famously topless-friendly, though sightings are rare. Was it easy to get around? On crowded days, parking can be tricky (locals come to the city park for a lot of other activities). The paid lot fills up quickly and street signage can be hard to understand mainly because everyone ignores the regulations. There is a nominal fee to enter the pool. If you've got a canine companion, head to the free, dog-friendly downstream area (though it's rockier and not as lush). All said and done, what and who is this best for? This is a must-do for outdoor enthusiasts, but it will top any local's list because a municipal fresh-water pool in a natural setting is rare. Mayfield Park Let's start big picture. The 21-acre Mayfield Preserve , two acres of gardens, and a historic cottage comprise the tranquil Mayfield Park. It's been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1935, and has a mix of manicured and wild grounds with ponds, wildlife, and stone and mortar trails. The park's serene greenery offers a calming landscape with seating to enjoy the free-roaming peacocks and catch the nature that Austin is famous for, away from the traffic of the city. Any standout features or must-sees? Calling to each other around the park are two-dozen India Blue and Black-Shoulder peacocks. You can often find them in trees or on rooftops, and every peacock you see is a descendent of the original pair that arrived on the property almost a century ago. Male peacocks fan their tails to attract mates when signs of spring begin to show, peachicks hatch during late spring, and peacock feathers sprinkle the park after mating season in the summer. You can't feed the peacocks or wildlife, but you can revel in their presence. There's also a historic cottage with a cast iron pond filled with lilies, in addition to six other cement ponds with turtles, fish, frogs, snakes, and green herons. Gorgeous trees and flowers dot the walking trails , and there's plenty of seating if you want to rest or observe. Was it easy to get around? At the entrance, there's a sign with a map and a bit of park history, but it's overall easy to navigate, or wander, if that's what you prefer. Benches and spots to take a break are available throughout the well-kept grounds. Gardens and ponds are wheelchair accessible, thanks to the stone and mortar paths, but the historic cottage is not ADA accessible. All said and done, what and who is this best for? This is a free Austin landmark that highlights some of the best nature and wildlife in the city, and because it's move-at-your-own-pace, you can fit a visit or rest break in easily. Those who are nature or animal lovers, or who want a break from the city bustle, will find the park a wonderful retreat. Rainey Street Tell me: What's this place all about? Austin's traditional bungalow homes, many built from 1885 to 1937, were renovated and morphed into the bars and restaurants that decorate Rainey Street . Wander around and you'll see food trucks tucked in alongside spots like Half Step , Geraldine's , Craft Pride , Lustre Pearl, Emmer & Rye , and Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden . It's a spot to relax on a porch or picnic table during the day, and party with friends or your significant other at night. What's it like being there? Daytime brings chilled-out day-drinking, families, dogs on porches, and groups of friends while night is all bout bar hopping and live music. These refurbished bungalows house top-notch food and drinks, many with Texas roots, and whether you're coming for a band, cocktail, or favorite dish, you'll be joined by all types at this neighborhood street. Who comes here? All kinds of people; families during the day walking around with their kids and dogs, nightly groups who love live music, college kids, regulars, and visitors. How does it fit into the Austin scene? If you're not into the overly boozy atmosphere that is Sixth Street, Rainey Street is a much better option. Locals and visitors come here to kick back, have fun, and soak in the live music Austin is famous for, with quality food and drinks. It's a revamped piece of Austin's history that's gotten a twist away from residential, following along the changes the city's seeing as a whole. So then what, or who, do you think it's best for? For daytime, families, groups of friends, couples, and those with pets hang out and relax on porches at restaurants or scope out different food trucks. At night, it's all kinds who visit their favorite spots or bar hop, but livelier and more upbeat in terms of vibe. If you want a quiet, intimate evening, Rainey Street isn't it. "Greetings From Austin" Mural Let's start big picture. This much-Instagrammed mural is located on the southern exterior wall of Roadhouse Relics, the gallery and studio of Todd Sanders, an iconic artist responsible for some of Austin's most recognizable neon signage. Visitors come to take a picture in front of the mural, which transforms an otherwise unremarkable street corner in a part of South Austin dotted with bakeries, cafés, and food trucks. What makes up the mural? Inspired by a 1940s postcard, the vibrant mural depicts Austin landmarks like the Congress Avenue Bridge , The University of Texas Tower, and Barton Springs . It was lovingly restored in 2013, thanks to donations from the community. How are the logistics of a visit? To get the entire postcard in your shot, your photographer will need to step onto Annie Street, where there are frequently passing cars. Be patient, wait for a break in traffic, and snap the picture. The location is easily walkable from nearby South Congress Avenue. Parking is street-only; there are no lots. On a weekend, you may have to wait in a short line to take your photo. On a quieter weekday, you might find a couple taking engagement photos. All said and done, what and who is this best for? Many consider a photo in front of this iconic mural the perfect memento from their trip to Austin. But if your trips don't require a certain number of Instagrammable moments, skip it. Mount Bonnell Let's start big picture. This well-manicured outdoor landmark is located in a tony residential neighborhood. Officially called Covert Park, the attraction here is Mount Bonnell, which visitors of all ages seek out for its scenic summit views. The wide, limestone-paved staircase is serene and, blessedly, shaded with trees. Any standout features or must-sees? The reward for your climb a limestone-paved, trellised lookout at the top of the stairs is a set of sweeping views of the city's prized Lake Austin (which is technically a river). The perfect spot to take in a sunset, you'll see the hilly terrain of the city and the arches on the Pennybacker Bridge . Voyeuristic types may enjoy peeking in the backyards of multimillion-dollar lakefront homes below. Most visitors come for a quick photo op, but there are a few well-marked paths that lead to picnic tables for those who want to stay a while. Don't be surprised if you stumble onto an engagement proposal. Was it easy to get around? It's extremely easy to locate the small, well-marked parking area and there is ample street parking, even on crowded day most visitors come to take a picture and then head back down the stairs, making for quick turnaround. What's the bottom line? This is a free, memorable landmark with unmatched views of Austin. Though the staircase is long (about 100 steps), it can easily be traversed in sandals and won't take long to get to the top and back down again. This is not a hike, so recreation enthusiasts might want to skip it in favor of Austin's more challenging outdoor adventures. Allens Boots What is this shop? You'll immediately recognize this footwear institution by the red cowboy boot signage an icon in and of itself on funky South Congress Avenue. The store has been fitting men and women for cowboy boots since before the strip attracted tourists. What can we find here, or what should we look for? The first thing you'll notice is the smell of leather. Then the shelves that house thousands of pairs of cowboy boots, from exotic Caiman crocodile skin to trendy Western booties. Texans will recognize brands like Lucchese and Tony Lama; the uninitiated might gravitate towards Frye. Need a whole head-to-toe look? There are cowboy hats, belts, leather jackets, jeans, and other accessories. If money's no object, what goes in the cart? $3,000 alligator-skin boots by Lucchese. And … what if we're on a strict budget? It's hard to find a pair of boots for under $200, though some basic Justin styles are closer to $100. If you're on a tight budget, head for the hats a basic straw version costs about $40. Who else shops here? As many tourists come here to ogle the selection as to seriously shop. You'll spot a few locals too: Every self-respecting Austinite owns at least one pair of cowboy boots. Any other tips for a visit? If you've never owned cowboy boots, try on a pair even if you have no intention of buying them. It's an experience down to the art of removing them. Same goes for the hats; see how you look in a Stetson, at least for a photo op. And check out the framed photos of all the celebrities who have shopped there. The White Horse What do you notice when you walk in? This is perhaps the coolest honky tonk in Austin. The no-frills space puts newcomers at ease, while regulars take to the dance floor when live music is playing every night on the very small stage. A photo booth, pool tables, and a small yard with seating allow for breathers between sets. So who's there? The energy at this dive never seems to wane. And the dynamic crowd is one of the best surprises here a multigenerational mix of hipsters, ranchers, rockabillies, and bikers convene nightly. How are the drinks? A full bar with whiskey on tap ensures everyone in the house is having a good time. Drinks are about as cheap as they get. Worth ordering something to eat, too? From 6 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. every day, there aree tacos, Mexican hot dogs (with bacon, onion, and pico de gallo), and burgers for famished barflies. If you're looking for reliability, get the al pastor taco. Did the staff do you right? The bartenders here don't mess around they're not only serving the drinks, but leading the party as well. When they get slammed, you may have to throw some elbows to get your order in. Wrap it up: what are we coming here for? This is old faithful for a rowdy no-holds-barred night out on the town, dancing and drinking until the early morning hours. Ideal for birthdays, and every end of the bachelor/bachelorette spectrum. Kayaking and Paddleboarding on Lady Bird Lake Let's start big picture. What's the vibe here? Year-round, locals and travelers head to Lady Bird Lake to kayak and paddleboard on the Colorado River . Multiple companies, like Rowing Dock and Texas Rowing Center, have kayaks and paddleboards for rent, and the area is dog-friendly. It's wild enough that you can fish for bass or carp, take your dog to Red Bud Island for a hike, and see Mexican Free-Tailed Bats fly out from Congress Avenue bridge . Trekking out on Lady Bird Lake is mixing Austin's active lifestyle with the nature the city works to preserve. There's no motorized boat traffic allowed, so it's great for families, pets, and outdoor adventurists. Any standout features or must-sees? If you're kayaking or paddleboarding during the day, don't miss the birds, fish, and other wildlife around the lake, and enjoy the tree-lined shores as well as the striking lakefront homes. If you're heading out at night, don't miss bat season from May to October. You can watch 1.5 million of them fly overhead as they head out to hunt. Was it easy to get around? It's easy to find one of the many drop-in points in the parks around the lake, or a place to rent equipment from. There are plenty of signs telling you where you can park, and if you need a break while paddling, you can just stop without worrying about boats. What's it cost? Rentals range from $10 to $20 per hour, or up to $45 for the day. It's a rather inexpensive way to enjoy Austin's outdoors without breaking your budget. Active travelers with kids or pets, or who want to get a closer view of the scenery, this activity is ideal for you. The Contemporary Austin What's this place all about? This museum is composed of two different venues: The Jones Center, a striking contemporary building on a busy downtown street corner, and Laguna Gloria, a 14-acre outdoor site on Lake Austin that houses a sculpture park and an Italianate-style villa. What will we see here? At the Jones Center, the rotating exhibit on the ground floor is usually the highlight. Floor to ceiling windows make the work, ranging from video installation to experimental art, visible to passers-by. One exhibit saw neon letters spelling "With liberty and justice for all" covering the perimeter of the rooftop gallery that could be seen from the street from the street. Laguna Gloria is a lush, picturesque setting on Lady Bird Lake; artwork is limited and can be viewed by taking a short stroll through the gardens. There is a limited amount of art inside the villa. The Contemporary Austin also runs a program called "Museum Without Walls," which aims to bring art out into the community, in addition to a public art collaboration with Waller Creek Conservancy, a chain of parks around a restored Waller Creek in downtown Austin. There, visitors can view David Deming's restored and repainted Mystic Raven , which abstractly represents the human body and the spirit of a bird. What did you make of the crowd? Though the Jones Center is a must-do for tourists who want to experience Austin's art scene, it's never overcrowded. Laguna Gloria is a family-friendly, serene setting, frequented by locals who want to spend time outdoors or attend a drawing class. Any advice for the time- or attention-challenged? If the current exhibition is not of interest, you'll cover the small number of artworks at Jones Center's pretty quickly. Laguna Gloria is likewise easy to navigate; there are fewer than two dozen pieces of outdoor art. Must-hits include: Terry Allen's cast of a 1950s Chevy, Tom Friedman's stainless steel human figure looking up at the sky, and, closer to the water, a painted steel platform by Liam Gillick that juxtaposes the natural landscape. Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater Give us the big picture: What's the vibe of the place, what's it like? The Moody Theater is the permanent home of the Austin City Limits television show, a Peabody Award-winning PBS show that's now the longest-running music series in American television history. Before entering the theater, lucky ticket holders (who won their coveted seats via an online lottery system) walk past an iconic statue of Willie Nelson and ascend the stairs to an outdoor patio, which overlooks downtown Austin and has large bars for pre-show drinks. Once inside the intimate, tiered venue, the audience is greeted by the series host; the atmosphere is charged as the musicians take the stage, which is decorated with an outline of the downtown skyline. What kinds of events can we see here? The music spans all genres, from old school country greats to contemporary artists like Florence and the Machine. How are the seats? Every seat offers a great view of the stage and the room has state-of-the-art acoustics. Those with tickets closest to the front will have to stand for the entire show (about an hour). The performance is like what you'd see if you watched the musicians in a recording studio they'll play songs specifically for the taping and sometimes even re-start them to get it right for the show. Good for kids? Show's are family friendly if you can manage to win enough tickets. Anything in particular that makes this place special, from the programming to a unique feature it has? This is often a chance to see big names playing stripped down and acoustic sets, so expect to be wowed by the artist's talents.

It could receive a new exterior look as part of its refresh to put it in line with the rest of Acura's lineup. A fresh multimedia system is also possible.

The Tiguan owns a good predicted reliability rating, and it has plenty of cargo space and a comfortable ride, but its uninspiring engine keeps it from ranking higher.	The 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan claims a spot in the top half of our compact SUV rankings. The Tiguan owns a good predicted reliability rating, and it has plenty of cargo space and a comfortable ride, but its uninspiring engine keeps it from ranking higher. Is the Volkswagen Tiguan a Good SUV? Yes, the Tiguan is a good compact SUV . It delivers a smooth ride over most road surfaces, and few rivals have more passenger and cargo space. This Volkswagen also has plenty of standard and available features, and it's one of the few compact SUVs available with three rows of seats. It does have some shortcomings though. The Tiguan's engine feels underpowered at times, and it doesn't get great fuel economy. Should I Buy the Volkswagen Tiguan? While the Tiguan has some positives, including a good predicted reliability rating, many class rivals offer the same benefits without the VW's drawbacks. The Mazda CX-5 has good fuel estimates and a sporty ride, and the Honda CR-V has more cargo space and an upscale cabin. Neither offers third-row seating like the Tiguan, however. Should I Buy a New or Used Volkswagen Tiguan? Volkswagen redesigned the Tiguan for the 2018 model year. The 2019 model received no major changes, so you could save money and get a virtually identical SUV by purchasing a 2018 Tiguan. You could save even more money with a Tiguan from the previous generation, but you'd miss out on substantial updates, including third-row seats, more passenger space, greater fuel efficiency, and standard smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Read our reviews of the 2016 , 2017 and 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan for more information.

With a starting MSRP of $24,295, the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan costs more than some class rivals. The highest trim is the SEL Premium with an R-Line package. It has an MSRP of $38,895, which is higher than the starting prices of some luxury compact SUVs . Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Volkswagen dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Volkswagen deals page . Volkswagen Tiguan Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Volkswagen Tiguan or Honda CR-V? The Honda CR-V is one the best compact SUVs you can buy. It's one of the only vehicles in the class to offer more cargo room than the Tiguan, both in total and behind the rear seats. The CR-V has a classy cabin, spacious seats, and a gentle, composed ride. Although both cars have similar base prices, the top-level CR-V costs around $4,450 less than the Tiguan SEL Premium. The CR-V is more fuel-efficient as well. Go with the Honda. Which Is Better: Volkswagen Tiguan or Mazda CX-5? The Mazda CX-5 ranks near the top of its class. For 2019, it gains a new turbocharged engine option and available connectivity features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Mazda has an upscale cabin and decent acceleration, and it stands out as one of most agile SUVs in the class. On the other hand, the Volkswagen Tiguan has more cargo room, a better predicted reliability rating, and a gentler ride. Even so, the CX-5 is a better SUV for most shoppers. Which Is Better: Volkswagen Tiguan or Subaru Forester? The Subaru Forester is another high-ranking compact SUV. It has more cargo room than the VW. It also has higher fuel economy estimates, which is especially impressive given its standard all-wheel drive. Both vehicles can feel underpowered on the highway, but the Subaru has sharper handling and greater composure on the road. It has more standard safety features too. Their respective base trims are priced similarly, so there's little competition here. The Volkswagen is a good pick, but the Subaru is a better one. Tiguan Interior How Many People Does the Tiguan Seat? Front-wheel-drive Tiguans seat seven, while all-wheel-drive models come in either a five- or seven-seat configuration. Cloth upholstery is standard. Leatherette or leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver's seat, and a heated steering wheel are available. Adults have plenty of space to sit in the first and second rows. The Tiguan is one of the only compact SUVs to offer third-row seating, but its best left for children. Tiguan and Child Car Seats This VW has two full sets of LATCH car-seat connectors for the rear outboard seats, as well as an additional tether anchor for the rear middle seat. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the setup the second-highest rating of Acceptable for ease of use. The IIHS says the lower anchors can be difficult to maneuver around. Tiguan Interior Quality The Tiguan has a nice interior with mostly high-quality materials, though some class rivals are more upscale inside. Tiguan Cargo Space The three-row Tiguan has 12 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, 33 cubic feet behind the second row, and a maximum 65.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down. The two-row VW has a little more room, with 37.6 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats and a total of 73.5 cubic feet with them folded. The totals for both the two- and three-row Volkswagen models are above average for the class. Tiguan Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation Standard in this SUV are smartphone integration via Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 6.5-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a six-speaker sound system. Available features include Volkswagen Digital Cockpit, a navigation system, an 8-inch touch screen, HD Radio, satellite radio, a nine-speaker premium Fender stereo, push-button start, remote start, proximity keyless entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a sunroof. The infotainment system is user-friendly, and Volkswagen's Digital Cockpit provides a 12.3-inch screen instead of a traditional gauge cluster. Standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are a plus. For more information, read What Is Apple CarPlay? and What Is Android Auto? Tiguan Performance Tiguan Engine: Unimpressive The sole engine offered in the Tiguan is a 2.0-liter turbo-four that makes 184 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard. While this turbocharged engine is fine for cruising around town, it struggles to deliver enough power to pass other vehicles on the highway. Acceleration is sluggish, and the transmission sometimes hesitates to shift. Tiguan Gas Mileage: Gas Pains The 2019 VW Tiguan earns an EPA-estimated 22 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. Many class rivals, such as the Nissan Rogue and Jeep Cherokee , get better fuel economy ratings. Tiguan Ride and Handling: Comfortable, Not Sporty This Volkswagen SUV has a comfortable ride. Bumps and ruts in the road do little to disrupt ride comfort. However, the Tiguan rolls around corners. Shoppers looking for agility might consider the Mazda CX-5 . The Tiguan has 7.9 inches of ground clearance and standard front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional. Tiguan Reliability Is the Volkswagen Tiguan Reliable? The 2019 Tiguan features an above-average predicted reliability rating of four out of five from J.D. Power. Volkswagen Tiguan Warranty The VW Tiguan is backed by Volkswagen's six-year/72,000-mile limited warranty. That's twice as long as many compact SUV warranties. Tiguan Safety Tiguan Crash Test Results The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2019 Tiguan four out of five stars in its rollover test and five stars in side crash tests. However, the agency noted an issue with the left driver door, which could unlock and open in a side impact crash. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave this vehicle the highest rating of Good in all categories except headlight testing. Here, the Tiguan got a Marginal rating for how well it illuminates the road ahead. Tiguan Safety Features A rearview camera comes standard in this VW. Other available safety features include blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, automatic high beams, adaptive headlights, and a surround-view parking camera. Which Volkswagen Tiguan Model Is Right for Me? The 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan is available in five trim levels: S, SE, SEL, SEL R-Line, and SEL Premium. All trims have a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive, and third-row seating. All-wheel drive is offered with each trim for $1,300. You lose the third row when you add AWD, though you can add it back for $595. The Volkswagen Tiguan SE is a good bet as it adds comfort and safety features not found in the base trim. The higher trims offer even more safety and technology features though, and Volkswagen offers few packages in the lower trims. You may want to spring for the SEL Premium if you're looking for the latest safety or convenience features, including navigation, adaptive cruise control, and parking sensors. Volkswagen Tiguan S The base Volkswagen Tiguan S has an MSRP of $24,295. It comes with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a 6.5-inch touch screen, a six-speaker stereo, a USB port, Bluetooth, automatic headlights, alloy wheels, cloth seats, and a rearview camera. For $450, you can get the Driver Assistance package, which adds forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. Volkswagen Tiguan SE The Volkswagen Tiguan SE starts at $26,695. It gains the features of the Driver Assistance package, as well as a larger 8-inch touch screen, HD Radio, satellite radio, two more USB ports, push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, proximity keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leatherette upholstery, heated front seats, a 10-way power-adjustable driver's seat, and pedestrian detection. A panoramic sunroof is offered for $1,200. Volkswagen Tiguan SEL With an MSRP of $31,795, the Volkswagen Tiguan SEL comes with a sunroof, a navigation system, Digital Cockpit, a power liftgate, remote start, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, and larger alloy wheels. No notable packages are offered with this trim. Volkswagen Tiguan SEL R-Line The Tiguan SEL R-Line has an MSRP of $33,645. It is a new trim for the 2019 model year, though it had been a package in the 2018 Tiguan. It has the same features list as the SEL, but with larger alloy wheels, an engine stop-start system, and unique exterior styling details. Volkswagen Tiguan SEL Premium The top-of-the-line Volkswagen Tiguan SEL Premium has a base price of $37,195. It comes with standard all-wheel drive, leather seats, a heated steering wheel, a Fender premium sound system, a hands-free liftgate, adaptive headlights, automatic high beams, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a surround-view parking camera, lane keep assist, and lane departure warning. As with the SEL, you can get this trim with an R-Line package. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Volkswagen dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Volkswagen deals page . The Final Call The 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan SUV has a lot going for it, including a lengthy features list, a large cargo hold, and a comfortable ride. It also has a leg up on many competitors by being one of the few small SUVs available with three rows of seats. Still, its unimpressive engine and lackluster fuel economy keep the Tiguan from challenging for a top spot in our compact SUV rankings . It's a good vehicle, but it doesn't really stand out in this competitive class. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis.

AAARviJ	foodanddrink	recipes	Carnitas, Al Pastor, Barbacoa: Here's the 411 on Mexican Meats	A margarita-drenched Cinco de Mayo celebration or a hot summer afternoon in the backyard would pair perfectly with a festive Mexican feast of tacos and grilled meats.	A margarita-drenched Cinco de Mayo celebration or a hot summer afternoon in the backyard would pair perfectly with a festive Mexican feast of tacos and grilled meats. With a menagerie of Spanish monikers from carnitas to carne asada , taco meat terminology can get a bit confusing. Here's the breakdown of Mexican meats: Carne Asada Carne asada is grilled, marinated pieces of beef (typically sirloin or rib) served inside burritos and tacos. Get a recipe for carne asada tacos here . Carnitas Carnitas is shoulder of pork that's been seasoned, braised until tender with lard and herbs (oregano, marjoram, bay leaves, garlic), pulled apart, and then oven-roasted until slightly crisp, then eaten alone or used as a filling for tacos, tamales, tortas, and burritos. Get a slow-cooker carnitas recipe here . Al Pastor Al pastor is crisp-thin shavings of vertical spit-roasted pork, marinated with guajillo chiles and achiote, then served on tortillas. Pastor means "shepherd," the name given to Lebanese merchants who immigrated to Mexico City in the early 1900s, bringing the concept of shawarma with them. Get a recipe for spicy pork al pastor quesadillas here . Cochinita Pibil Cochinita pibil is whole suckling pig or pork shoulder that's marinated in citrus with achiote, then wrapped in banana leaves and roasted. Historically, it's buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom. Get a recipe for cochinita pibil tacos here . Barbacoa Traditionally, barbacoa is beef cheek and head that's covered in leaves from the maguey plant, then slow cooked over a wood fire in a pit in the ground. In America today, it also refers to spicy, shredded, slow-braised beef that's been made tender, then pulled apart. Get a recipe for slow-cooker barbacoa beef tacos here . Got all that?

Pay homage to mom and her culinary skills on Mother's Day and all year long with these familiar recipes that are frugal and oh-so tasty.	You might find yourself daydreaming about old-fashioned dishes your mom made for you when you were a kid   though you may be reluctant to use some of the same ingredients as she did. Pay homage to mom and her culinary skills on Mother's Day and all year long with these familiar recipes that are frugal and oh-so tasty. Family Favorites From preparing dinner for mom to creating memories with your kids, cooking is a loving way to celebrate Mother's Day and share traditional family meals year-round. The comfort food prepared by mom is one of life's little pleasures, and many of the classic meals on American moms' menus are also pretty cost-savvy. To save even more, you can swap out expensive ingredients and try these other thrifty takes on 12 favorite dishes. Related: 21 Hearty Casserole and Stew Recipes That Reheat Well Lasagna The building blocks of lasagna   sauce and pasta   are cheap, and buying them on sale only sweetens the deal. Whipping ricotta with an egg and some salt keeps the cost of cheese down, and a little Parmesan goes a long way. Classic meat fillings can also hike up the cost, so instead, grab a packet of frozen veggies, season the same as you would meat, and layer them into the dish. Potpie Thick gravy and crumbly crust are a winning combo in this dish that has become so symbolic of weeknight family meals. The most costly part of potpie is premium cuts of meat such as tender beef, turkey, or chicken breast. Increase the amount of veggies and use the meat sparingly to further reduce the cost of this dish. Burgers Burgers have become so ubiquitous and experimental that it's easy to find versions that cost more than a plate of filet mignon. A traditional home-style burger is a simple indulgence that can be made less costly by substituting half the ground beef with ground turkey. Prices for ground turkey are typically $1 or $2 lower per pound than ground beef   and considerably less than the cost of a pricey lean burger. Tater Tots Crispy, salty potatoes are one of Americans' favorite foods, and surely something everyone remembers from childhood, even if mom only heated them up from the freezer bag. While tots are still delicious and often inexpensive, there's not much cheaper than a plain potato . Cutting a potato into cubes, seasoning, and roasting in the oven creates small morsels of crispy brown potatoes   cheaper and a whole lot healthier than tater tots. Chicken Noodle Soup Generations past indulged in grocery store convenience foods such as canned green beans and premade broth. While even a can of condensed soup was transformed into a heartwarming meal when mom added her special touches, chicken noodle soup is cheapest (and best tasting) when homemade. Don't cut corners with rotisserie chicken and canned or boxed broth. Get a chicken, some herbs, and veggies and make your own . Mashed Potatoes Mashed potatoes are a familiar favorite on many American dinner tables   made all the better with the addition of butter and cream. Using a ricer instead of a traditional masher achieves a creamier and lighter texture, allowing you to cut out, or cut down by half, the butter and cream, which are still the most expensive parts of the dish. Sloppy Joes The seasonings for sloppy Joes, typically canned or in a packet, are inexpensive, but the cost of a meal that relies so heavily on ground beef can add up. To cut that cost, take advantage of sales or substitute less expensive cuts of meat . Another way to reduce the cost per serving   and sneak a little fiber into this fun meal   is to add some coarsely chopped beans to the mix for bulk. To keep taste and texture intact, add up to one-third cup of cooked pinto or black beans. Grilled Salmon Healthy and simple, grilled fish continues to be a weeknight staple in many American homes. Seasoned just right   with lemon and herbs, for example   the flavor of the fish becomes secondary to its oily richness and meaty texture. Swap out expensive cuts of salmon or swordfish for inexpensive options such as tilapia or catfish. Many of these less costly fish provide similar nutritional benefits and create satisfying meals. Steak and Chops For many, hearty steaks and chops come to mind when thinking of home-cooked meals by mom. These expensive cuts don't have to be saved for special occasions, or ruled out for larger gatherings. Make the meat go further by slicing it up and tossing it with egg noodles or rice and serving gravy on the side. Bulking up the meal with other filling carbs can double the number of servings while still keeping the meaty flavor and texture in every bite. Banana Split Make this favorite indulgent dessert an inexpensive everyday favorite with one simple trick: Instead of serving ice cream between halves of a banana , freeze the banana until it becomes its own soft, sweet, and creamy ice-cream-like pop. Stick toothpicks through cut sections of banana, drizzle with chocolate, and roll them in nuts, then freeze on wax paper. Once frozen, wrap the treats individually to store for up to a month. The flavors hit all the notes of a classic banana split, without the cost (or calories) of ice cream. Oatmeal While not glamorous, oatmeal has been a nutritious and familiar breakfast staple among Americans for years. For big savings, skip the individually wrapped and flavored varieties. Buying plain oatmeal in bulk and flavoring at home saves up to half the cost of each serving. Homemade versions also allow for an endless variety of flavors, plus experimentation that could spark a lifelong love for cooking. Risotto A routine meal in Italian-American households, risotto is an inexpensive, comforting treat. To make it even more budget-friendly, use a pressure cooker , which achieves a creamy and rich texture with only broth and rice, leaving out the expensive butter and cheese typically used to achieve risotto's trademark silkiness. Add of dab of grated Romano on top and no one will be the wiser.
BBV4elZ	lifestyle	lifestylepetsanimals	Dog breeds gaining the most popularity		Dog breeds gaining the most popularity Sorry cat lovers, but everyone knows dogs are man's best friends. No other animal exhibits the absolute, unadulterated joy of a dog greeting its human companion after they arrive home from a long day at work. Dog owners have to ask: "Does any person love me as much as my dog?" The answer, of course, is probably no. Dogs are great friends to humankind, but they're also something of miracle workers. They've saved countless owners' lives , dialed 911 in emergencies, served as guide dogs to humans and to each other, and stood the test of time as faithful companions for at least the last 35,000 years . But as times change, so too do pet owners' preferences. Breeds that were wildly popular a few decades ago may have fallen out of fashion. In other cases, an underdog can rise to the top of the charts. Stacker pulled data from the American Kennel Club (AKC) to compare dog popularity rankings from 1999 and 2019; the 2019 popularity rankings were released on May 1, 2020 . The 37 dog breeds that gained popularity since 1999 are ordered by their 20-year rank change and further ordered by their 2019 rank to break any ties. AKC only recognized 147 breeds in 1999, so any dog breeds added since then were not included in the original list. Read on to find out which dogs have gained the most in popularity in the last two decades. You may also like: 23 dogs that won't make you sneeze #37. German shepherd - 20-year rank change: +1 --- 2019 AKC rank: #2 --- 1999 AKC rank: #3 The German shepherd has gained the least popularity but that is only because it perennially ranks as one of the most popular dogs . There are no real surprises behind the authoritative herder's consistency: loyalty, intelligence, hard-working, adoring, noble, and attractive. GSDs show up in police forces, the military, and as service companions. #36. Irish wolfhound - 20-year rank change: +3 --- 2019 AKC rank: #76 --- 1999 AKC rank: #79 The tallest AKC breed is known as a dignified, mild-tempered big-game hunter. Irish wolfhounds' history and legendary popularity trace as far back as antiquity, though the AKC notes they were bred from British and Middle Eastern hounds . By the 1700s, Irish wolfhounds had so successfully hunted wolves that they nearly went extinct with no work remaining. Today they remain popular as large, but inherently serene companions. #35. Siberian husky - 20-year rank change: +3 --- 2019 AKC rank: #15 --- 1999 AKC rank: #18 Even dog breeds can use some publicity now and again. That's exactly what happened when Siberian huskies appeared on "Game of Thrones" as dire wolves. The show certainly contributed to the breed's popularity spike, in spite of animal welfare groups urging people not to purchase these dogs without a proper understanding of the extensive amount of exercise and attention they require. For those fully prepared to put in the work, the Siberian husky is free-spirited, playful, and sociable . #34. Doberman pinscher - 20-year rank change: +4 --- 2019 AKC rank: #19 --- 1999 AKC rank: #23 Doberman pinschers have become more mainstream as our culture has gradually dispelled pervasive, negative stereotypes about the breed. Many people wrongly thought of Doberman pinschers as " overly aggressive," even sinister " guard dogs. Most folks today understand Doberman pinschers are extremely intelligent, loving, and responsive to strong leadership. This dog is also a recent award winner , which has helped its rise to favoritism. #33. Standard schnauzer - 20-year rank change: +5 --- 2019 AKC rank: #97 --- 1999 AKC rank: #102 The standard schnauzer is the original version of the giant counterpart also featured on this list. This " sometimes willful but ever reliable " dog was loved so much that breeders were inspired to create both larger and smaller variations. The breed's ever-growing popularity is highlighted by an AKC article begging the question, " Why doesn't everyone have a standard schnauzer?" You may also like: Every new dog breed recognized in the 21st century #32. Border terrier - 20-year rank change: +5 --- 2019 AKC rank: #84 --- 1999 AKC rank: #89 The wiry, tough-as-nails border terrier is an annually popular small companion. Bred on the English-Scottish border as capable, agile foxhunters meant to protect sheep, their weatherproof coats and "no-frills" attitude meant they were historically low-maintenance workers. For the same reasons, they remain popular as easily trainable pets . #31. Brittany - 20-year rank change: +5 --- 2019 AKC rank: #26 --- 1999 AKC rank: #31 Brittanys share a name with the region of France where they were first bred, as well as with many women born in the '90s. This breed is happy, affectionate, and energetic. Brittanys also take quite well to obedience training. These dogs have seen a slow but steady rise in popularity, holding their spot in the mid- to high-20s on the AKC list for several years. #30. Whippet - 20-year rank change: +6 --- 2019 AKC rank: #57 --- 1999 AKC rank: #63 No, that Devo song is not about them. But whippets still have plenty going for them.

AAxL9NH	health	medical	14 Foods You Had No Idea Could Give You Food Poisoning	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an estimated 48 million people contract food poisoning every year that's one in six Americans. We talked to experts about the foods that are most likely to turn on you.	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an estimated 48 million people contract food poisoning every year that's one in six Americans. We talked to experts about the foods that are most likely to turn on you. Sunny-side-up eggs What's not to love about an oozy egg, especially over biscuits and gravy or a corned beef hash? Potential salmonella infection, that's what. Salmonella is among the most common causes of food poisoning and it can turn up in your egg courtesy of an infected laying hen. How to avoid food poisoning: The risk is relatively rare, but if you're feeding little kids, the elderly, or anyone with a compromised immune system, cook the egg thoroughly to kill off any dangerous bacteria. Opt for hard-boiled, thoroughly scrambled, or over-well eggs. Another option, says Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, PhD, professor and director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia in Griffin, is pasteurized eggs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has created Ask Karen , a service that allows you to submit questions about eggs, meat, and poultry and get a response any time of the day or night. Rotisserie chicken A piping-hot rotisserie chicken from the grocery store is a quick and tasty meal just be sure to eat it while it's still hot. If you leave it on the counter for a couple of hours, any bacteria on the bird could begin to flourish. (This is true if you roast your own chicken, as well.) 'You have to assume that the raw chicken and its juices are contaminated,' says Patricia Griffin, MD, chief of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Enteric Diseases Epidemiology Branch, and act accordingly. How to avoid food poisoning: Bacteria can double every 20 minutes at room temperature; keep your food out of the danger zone between 40 °F and 140 °F until you're ready to eat it. If you left the chicken on your counter for more than two hours, you're best off throwing it out.'Cut up the rotisserie chicken in pieces so they cool quickly to a safe temperature,' says Marianne H. Gravely, senior technical information specialist at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA.If you're cooking your own roasted chicken, don't wash it you'll only spread germs. Instead, focus on cooking it to the right temperature. According to the USDA Meat and Poultry Roasting Chart , the bird should be cooked until the internal temperature is 165° F, which amounts to about 20 to 30 minutes per pound (with an additional 15 to 30 minutes if it's stuffed) at 350° F. Here's how to tell the difference between a stomach bug and food poisoning . Chicken liver There's a growing trend to eat chicken liver on the underdone side, but that could be a very risky choice, explains Dr. Griffin. It's still chicken, and the livers can be loaded with the bacteria campylobacter, she warns. How to avoid poisoning: Be wary of recipes and menu items that recommend preparing the delicacy 'lightly sautéed.' The livers should reach an internal temperature of 165° F and have a crumbly texture. Burgers Ground beef, pork, and poultry can be problematic because any pathogens on the surface before its ground ends up getting into all those little nooks and crannies. What's more, they may escape death, even as the surface areas of the patty look hot and toasty. As with any meat, points out Gravely, 'color is not a reliable indicator of doneness.' Sometimes beef can look a bit pink, she says, even if it's cooked to a safe temperature. 'And sometimes it can look brown when it's not a safe temperature.' How to avoid food poisoning: A food thermometer is a must. Ground beef and pork must be cooked to at least 160° F. Ground turkey which is particularly tricky because it looks less pink even it's raw state and chicken should be cooked for 165° F, according to the USDA's Safe Minimum Cooking Temperature Guidelines. Don't miss these other common summer BBQ foods that can cause food poisoning , too. Tuna If it smells okay, it's probably okay, right? Wrong. When raw fish isn't stored properly before it's cooked, it can develop something called scombroid poisoning and you won't be able to sniff out the danger. Tuna is especially prone to this type of toxicity (other culprits include bluefish, mahi-mahi, and abalone). Infected fish can taste burnt or peppery. In addition to the regular gastro-misery, you may experience a rash on the face and upper body, flushing, and sweating. How to avoid food poisoning: Order fish only in reputable restaurants. When you cook your own, bring the fish into the refrigerator as quickly as possible (so when grocery shopping, pick up the fish last, stick it into a cooler in your car, and go directly home). Raw fish should be cooked to 145 °F. Leftovers should be reheated to 165 °F and eaten within two days. Find out the other types of fish you should never order in a restaurant. Leafy green salads Consider this not an excuse to skip your vegetables, but an important reminder to wash (or cook) them well before eating and staying aware of recalls, like this spring's E. coli outbreak in romaine lettuce. Produce attributed to 48 percent of food-based illnesses between 1998 and 2008, according to the most recent CDC study on foodborne diseases .Leafy greens are particularly tricky because they're eaten as salads and not cooked so proper washing is essential. After all, farms are not pristine: potential pathogens are everywhere, including in bird poop, fertilizer, ticks, tainted water, or as the result of poor hygiene. How to avoid food poisoning: Some bacteria can stick to the lettuce and even get into it, says Dr. Griffin So washing won't guarantee a bacteria-free leaf, but it can knock off dirt and reduce the risk of germs. Place the odds in your favor by buying greens that are in the best possible shape. 'Look for leaves that are firm and crisp,' says New York City nutrition coach Maria Marlowe, author of The Real Food Grocery Guide and founder of eatSlim and eatBeauty. For packaged lettuce, avoid the slightest sign of sliminess 'bacteria can spread quickly,' she says. For fresh herbs, she says, 'make sure the leaves are firmly attached to the stem and have no sign of brown or black spots.' Finally, triple-wash your lettuce before consuming. 'Don't just rinse under cold water, ' she says, 'but fill a large bowl with cold water, tear the leaves into the bowl, submerge and swirl with your hands for a minute or two, then lift the leaves into a strainer and dump the water.' Repeat twice more, then wipe or spin dry. Sprouts The sultry environment needed for a seed to sprout and grow is also the condition of choice for bacteria. 'The contamination happens typically in the seed, and when it starts to sprout the bacterial cells also get inside the plant, so washing the surface may not necessarily help,' says Dr. Diez-Gonzalez. How to prevent food poisoning: As of yet, there's no 100-percent foolproof way for rendering sprouts pathogen-free. Your safest bet is to cook them before eating them, or skipping them altogether. Don't miss these 10 food poisoning myths you can safely ignore . Potato salad A whole host of microscopic critters can grow in improperly handled potato salad especially if you get it at a deli, where cross-contamination with deli meat and cheese can occur. Contrary to popular belief, the problem is not the mayonnaise, says Gravely it's the potatoes. 'When vegetables are cut up, there are more surfaces exposed to potential pathogens,' she says, ' and the potato is cooked and soft as opposed to raw and hard, which also makes it more accessible to bacteria.' How to avoid food poisoning: Purchase your potato salad at a clean, reputable place, keep it chilled, and consume it within three days. Melons A few years ago, a massive cantaloupe recall traced the problem to water contaminated with listeria in the packing house. The trouble with melons as well as other fruit with a tough peel is that, because you don't eat it, you may be a tad lackadaisical about cleaning it. But once you're slicing through it, your knife can pick up any pathogens and pass them onto the edible portions. How to avoid food poisoning: 'Don't just rinse your cantaloupe, scrub it down and wipe it dry before you cut it open,' says Dr. Diez-Gonzalez. And after you slice it up, store the melon in the fridge and plan to polish it off within three days (or toss the rest). For more food safety strategies, download the Foodkeeper app created by the USDA, Cornell University, and The Food Marketing Institute. Follow these 8 rules this summer to avoid nasty food poisoning . Apple cider It may be tempting to stop by a roadside stand to try the fresh cider especially if you're with kids who are 'soooo thirsty' but proceed with caution. When apples (and other fruits) are pressed, any bacteria on the outer surface can get into the juice. How to avoid food poisoning: While healthy adults can fight off the illness, kids, the elderly, and anyone with a weakened immune system may not. To be safe, ask if the juice has been treated for safety, says Dr. Griffin. If not, head to the supermarket and look for a carton that indicates the juice has been pasteurized. Flour Flour is ground grain: If that grain has bugs in it, warn government food safety experts , those bugs can survive the milling process and end up in your pantry. That's why even eggless batter and dough are still potentially risky. How to avoid food poisoning: Always wash your hands after working with flour (that includes flour used for preparing tortilla and pizza dough). Cucumbers Contaminated cucumbers were the source of multiple salmonella outbreaks in recent years. Unlike many vegetables, they're rarely cooked so you're prone to any pathogens that might be on the peel even if you don't end up consuming the peel itself. Your knife blade picks up germs from the surface as you begin to slice and spreads them to the edible portions with every cut. 'Ready-to-eat products are higher risk than those that go through a [pathogen] inactivation step,' says Dr. Thompson. Seeded vegetables (a category that includes tomatoes and cucumbers) accounted for four salmonella outbreaks and 1,048 associated illnesses in 2015, the most recent year with available CDC stats. How to avoid food poisoning: Be sure to scrub cucumbers with water and a produce brush whether you're eating the peel or not. Wipe them dry and trim the bruises before you slice and serve. Check out the 7 foods that food safety experts always avoid. Red kidney beans The issue with red kidney beans isn't bacteria but a special kind of lectin. Lectin is a protein, and red kidney beans happen to have a type called 'red bean lectin' (or phytohaemagglutinin) that if it isn't destroyed by heating can cause vomiting and diarrhea. How to avoid food poisoning: Don't just soak your red kidney beans. Cook them in boiling water for a good half hour, advises the FDA's Bad Bug Book. Slow cookers won't work because the temperature never gets high enough. Or you can play it safe by using canned kidney beans. Cream-filled pastries and pies The problem with these treats is that they're prepared by hand and then eaten directly without any additional baking. So you're trusting that whoever has prepared your dessert has indeed washed his or her hands well. In tests, the nasty bacteria staphylococcus turns up on the skin of about a quarter of the population which means they can end up in your pastries. And you still face the bugs that can grow in improperly stored dairy if there's no baking, notes Sterling S. Thompson, PhD, president of B&G Safe Food Consulting, in Middletown, PA. How to avoid food poisoning: If a cream puff craving hits, make sure you're buying from a reputable, clean place that's regularly inspected and certified, says Dr. Diez-Gonzalez.

BBLIVQb	tv	tv-celebrity	Kylie Jenner Shares New Photo of 'Most Special Gift' Stormi's Face in Honor of 21st Birthday	Kylie Jenner Shares New Face Photo of Stormi for 21st Birthday	For her 21st birthday, Kylie Jenner is gifting her fans with a new adorable photo of her daughter Stormi ! After announcing in June that she would no longer be sharing images of her baby girl's face, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star kicked off her birthday festivities with a sweet tribute to her 6-month-old daughter. "Bringing in my birthday tonight with my most special gift. What was life before you, Stormi. I love you my little angel," Jenner captioned a new mother-daughter portrait on Instagram Thursday, one day before her Aug. 10 birthday. "My heart," the proud parent captioned another image. Thursday's birthday post about the pair may be an exception in Jenner's social media rule. A source previously told PEOPLE that Jenner had planned to keep her child's face off social media, a move that Stormi's father Travis Scott has also been following as of late . "Kylie felt so protective of her baby when she was pregnant. This is why she didn't share any bump pictures while she was pregnant," the source said in June. "After Stormi was born , Kylie was the proudest mom . She couldn't wait to show off Stormi to her fans. She posted pictures because she was so excited to be a mom ," the source shared. "Unfortunately, social media is a crazy place," continues the source, noting that "people have been making nasty comments" about Jenner's baby girl. In anticipation of her milestone birthday, Jenner also shared some of her throwback photos , including childhood images with dad Caitlyn Jenner . The pictures certainly highlighted how much Jenner has grown over the years, nearly 11 of which she's spent in front of the camera with her famous family on KUWTK . One adorable shot had the youngest KarJenner smiling at the camera, her hair in pigtails with matching pink hair ties and small hoop earrings. Another was a fan-created side-by-side, showing a younger Jenner   with an oversized pink bow in her hair   split with a current shot of the star. And what's a KarJenner birthday without a new product release? On Monday, the Kylie Cosmetics billionaire dropped her third annual birthday collection . "I can't believe I'm about to be 21," Jenner said on Instagram. "I also can't wait to share this collection with you guys. It is definitely the most personal collection that I have done so I hope you guys love it. My birthday collections are super special to me because the first collection I ever did was for my 19th birthday so this is going to be my third annual birthday collection."

BBIdY6V	autos	autosreview	2019 Ford Edge ST: Yes, There's Now an ST SUV	Honed for performance with 335 horsepower and a tuned suspension.	The Ford Edge has always been a bit of a wallflower. Competent, capable, and a decent seller (142,603 units in 2017), it simply has failed to generate much raw enthusiasm. Ford tried to change that perception when it plopped a version of its feisty 315-horse EcoBoost 2.7-liter V-6 under the hood of the second-gen Edge Sport; we appreciated the additional thrust, but never did we consider the Edge a candidate for the automaker's full ST treatment. Then again, who could have predicted a show about sweaty guys making knives would be a hit? It's tempting to dismiss the 2019 Ford Edge ST, which replaces the Sport model in the lineup, as a crass attempt to ascribe some hard-earned ST credibility to an otherwise civilian model. Ford has assured us that the Edge ST was, in fact, developed with the Ford Performance team, which the list of upgrades seems to confirm. Power Play Kicking off the makeover is the installation of a 335-hp version of the twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6, still with EcoBoost branding. With 380 lb-ft of torque, it outguns the outgoing 2.7 by 20 horsepower and 30 lb-ft. Likewise, a standard eight-speed automatic transmission replaces the six-speed automatic in the outgoing Edge Sport. Both should help propel the new Edge ST to 60 mph quicker than the 5.6 seconds we've recorded in the Edge Sport. All-wheel drive is standard, and an ST-tuned suspension is fitted for sharper responses and improved handling, Ford said. In addition to the hardware swaps, the Edge ST features a specific Sport mode that tightens throttle response and alters shift programming, including the ability to perform rev-matched downshifts and hold gears near the engine's redline. Selected by depressing the center button of the new console-mounted rotary shifter, Sport mode also preselects gears for sprightly corner exits, which should enable the driver to brake hard and dive deep into a corner at speed and exit in a lower gear, keeping engine rpm in the meat of the powerband. Optionally, drivers can call out their own shifts via the wheel-mounted shift paddles. Sport mode also provides greater engine braking and a slightly more aggressive exhaust note. Also, yes, all of that describes a Ford Edge. Ford said the team that developed the ST entered the project with specific grip, braking, ride, and handling targets tailored for enthusiasts. As evidence, consider the Edge ST's "relaxed" stability control in Sport mode, which "widens the window" regarding wheelspin and slip angle before it steps in to assist, Ford told us. Shutting off the stability control completely is a misnomer, as it leaves the system active to help prevent a rollover, an aspect we can dig. While the Edge ST gets standard 20-inch rolling stock, 21-inch wheels with summer performance tires are available. A performance-braking upgrade is also on the options list. In addition to swathing the calipers in red paint, the extra-cost binders swap in larger, 13.6-inch rotors in the rear in the quest for increased bite and thermal capability. Technology Prime The regular Edge is also refreshed for the 2019 model year, getting new fascia elements as well as a new liftgate, rear bumper, and illumination. ST-specific appearance cues include a wide mesh grille, side skirts, and dual exhaust outlets. Inside, more aggressively bolstered front seats join an ST logo on the wheel, seatbacks, and sill plates. The 2019 Edge ST shares in the standard 2019 Edge's bounty of standard and optional tech, safety, and driver-assist features. The Edge ST is an intriguing proposition, one that wasn't even a blip on our radar until now, and we do wonder exactly who will buy it. Price, of course, will determine where the Edge ST lands on the short list of nonpremium performance mid-size crossovers and SUVs. Currently, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SRT models start above $64,000; if the Edge ST comes in for significantly less, it may find a small but devoted audience. First, however, we need to get behind the wheel to determine if it's worthy of the ST suffix.
AAvKr4V	autos	autosreview	2010 Nissan Xterra: What You Need to Know	If you're looking for an off-road vehicle, the 2010 Nissan Xterra is one of the few 2010 compact SUVs that will fit the bill. However, the Xterra's truck-like performance, poor fuel economy and basic interior make it less refined than competing car-based crossovers.	If you're looking for an off-road vehicle, the 2010 Nissan Xterra is one of the few 2010 compact SUVs that will fit the bill. However, the Xterra's truck-like performance, poor fuel economy and basic interior make it less refined than competing car-based crossovers. The 2010 Nissan Xterra is ranked: #8 in 2010 Affordable SUVs with 2 Rows #10 in 2010 Off-Road SUVs #20 in 2010 Affordable Compact SUVs #39 in Used Off-Road SUVs under $20K #56 in Used SUVs with 2 Rows under $15K #83 in Used Compact SUVs under $15K The 2010 Nissan Xterra is a great off-roader, but its on-road performance simply can't compete with car-based crossovers in the class, like the 2010 Honda CR-V. Still, if you need go-anywhere capability, reviewers felt that the Xterra was one of the better performers in the class. When it was new, test drivers liked the Xterra's power and acceleration from a stop, but some took issue with its passing ability. The Xterra's V6 engine is more powerful than those found in many competing SUVs. However, with up to 16/20 mpg city/highway, the Xterra trails most of the competition when it comes to fuel economy. Also, most reviewers agreed that because the Xterra is a truck-based SUV, its on-road handling is rough with significant body lean, so it is best when traveling off-road. The Xterra's interior was mostly panned by auto reviewers because of its cheap materials and uncomfortable seats. The Xterra has plenty of space for passengers and their gear, but if you're planning on spending a lot of time commuting, the Xterra's cabin won't pamper you. Auto critics noted that the seats lack bolstering in the front and cushioning in the back. However, test drivers liked the versatile cargo space that has an available washable floor mat. Roof rails, cruise control, keyless entry and a six-speaker stereo come standard on the base Xterra X. Higher trim levels add enhancements that can make the Xterra more capable off-road, as well as features like foglights, Bluetooth, satellite radio and an upgraded stereo. Other Cars to Consider If you're looking at the Xterra, the 2010 Jeep Wrangler is also worth a look because of its excellent off-road performance. Much like the Xterra, the Wrangler has a choppy ride that isn't suited for on-road driving, but is one of the best off-road SUVs on the market. Both vehicles get comparable fuel economy, but the Xterra has a more powerful engine. While the Xterra may suit drivers who travel off the beaten path, the 2010 GMC Terrain is a better choice for those who stick to paved roads. The Terrain offers excellent safety scores and great fuel economy. While the Terrain's base engine is smaller than the Xterra's, it offers a car-like ride and a refined interior that the Xterra can't match.

There are also mileage limits to consider, and the best deals usually hinge on the buyer having excellent credit. Read on to learn about the best SUV lease deals available under $300 in April. 2020 Mazda CX-9 Lease Deal: $289 per month for 36 months with $2,999 due at signing The 2020 Mazda CX-9 is one of the most fun-to-drive SUVs on the market   but that doesn't mean sacrificing practicality. Thanks to its third-row seats, there is room for up to seven people aboard this ute. However, it's the CX-9's sharp handling and excellent ride quality that set it apart from the competition. This lease offer is for the CX-9 Sport trim level with front-wheel drive. Power is provided via a smooth 227-horsepower four-cylinder engine coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. The deal runs until April 30, and allows for 36,000 miles over the course of the three-year agreement. This deal isn't available everywhere, though similar offers can be found in most regions. Contact your local Mazda dealership to inquire about availability in your area. 2020 Toyota RAV4 Lease Deal: $209 per month for 36 months with $2,999 due at signing The Toyota RAV4 is currently the best-selling SUV in the U.S. What's its secret? To start, a total redesign for the 2019 model year gave the RAV4 more standard safety equipment, more horsepower, higher quality cabin materials, and improved fuel economy. In short, Toyota provided some serious upgrades for an already-great vehicle. This lease is for the entry-level, front-wheel-drive RAV4 in LE trim. Under the hood is a 203-horsepower four-cylinder engine that returns up to an EPA-estimated 28 mpg in city driving and 35 mpg on the highway. The three-year deal allows for 10,000 annual miles, and is valid until May 4. This offer is only available in certain regions, though similar deals with slightly higher monthly and down payments are widely available. Remember that having a strong credit score is usually required for the best lease deals. 2020 Chevrolet Equinox Lease Deal: $297 per month for 39 months with $0 due at signing The 2020 Chevrolet Equinox is a five-passenger SUV that's easy on your wallet for two reasons: Great fuel economy and this month's affordable lease offers. Thanks to its standard 137-horsepower four-cylinder engine, the Equinox returns an EPA-estimated 31 mpg during highway driving. However, power is quite lacking with this engine option. This lease deal is for the Equinox LT trim with front-wheel drive. Like most SUVs, all-wheel drive is optional, though it's usually more expensive. This low-mileage lease allows for 30,000 miles during the 39-month agreement, and is good until April 30. This deal is widely available, but be sure to contact your local dealership to confirm. 2020 Kia Sportage Lease Deal: $189 per month for 36 months with $3,329 due at signing The 2020 Kia Sportage could easily fool you into thinking you paid much more for your SUV. A high-quality interior and a user-friendly infotainment system give the Sportage an upscale look and feel. The Sportage comes with a long list of standard comfort and safety features, too. This deal applies to the Sportage LX, powered by a 181-horsepower four-cylinder engine and equipped with all-wheel drive. Standard features include an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a rearview camera, automatic high beams, and driver attention monitor. The deal runs until April 30, and permits 12,000 miles per year. Exact pricing will vary depending on where you live, so be sure to check with your local Kia dealership to confirm pricing and availability. 2020 Ford Escape Lease Deal: $289 per month for 36 months with $2,819 due at signing The 2020 Ford Escape is another practical SUV that happens to have a fun side. Like the Mazda CX-9 , the Escape has sharp handling that makes it easy and enjoyable to maneuver when the road ahead is twisty. There is also plenty of stretch-out space in the front and second row, not to mention more than 33 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. This offer runs until April 30 and applies to the front-wheel-drive Escape SE. This trim comes standard with comfort features like heated front seats, satellite radio, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, automatic climate control, and an 8-inch touch screen. Check with your local dealership for additional details, including mileage limits during the three-year deal and exact pricing in your area. Your credit score will determine your eligibility for this offer. 2020 Honda CR-V Lease Deal: $269 per month for 36 months with $3,099 due at signing The 2020 Honda CR-V is another popular SUV that's safe, affordable, and comfortable during long drives. It's also a champ when it comes to hauling lots of stuff, thanks to the 39.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. Powering the CR-V is a 190-horsepower four-cylinder coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Fuel economy with this engine is another strong point for the CR-V. The deal applies to the CR-V EX or LX trim levels, each fitted with all-wheel drive. The LX requires a slightly higher down payment, but monthly payments remain consistent. This lease expires on May 4, and allows for a total of 36,000 miles. While the offer is widely available, it's best to contact your local dealership to ensure this deal is valid in your area. 2020 Subaru Forester Lease Deal: $265 per month for 36 months with $2,465 due at signing The 2020 Subaru Forester makes your SUV shopping a little easier by taking away the choice of front- or all-wheel drive. That's because every Forester comes with the added grip of all-wheel drive   something that's especially handy for people living in areas with inclement weather and/or rough road surfaces. Powering the Forester is a four-cylinder engine that delivers a total of 182 horsepower. This engine is adequate for everyday driving, and this Subaru's ride and handling balance gives it a planted, confident feel on the road. This offer runs until April 30, and permits 36,000 miles over the three-year agreement. In addition to all-wheel drive, other notable standard features include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, satellite radio, and automatic climate control. It is widely available, but as always, it's best to contact your local dealership to confirm exact pricing and availability in your area. 2020 Chevrolet Trax Lease Deal: $233 per month for 39 months with $0 due at signing The 2020 Chevrolet Trax is a solid choice if you want the higher ride height of an SUV, but prefer something small and easy to park. Despite its tiny dimensions, the Trax has plenty of room for adults in both the front and second rows. Powering the Trax is a 138-horsepower engine coupled to a six-speed automatic. While the engine isn't all too thrilling, the Trax does come with one of the most user-friendly infotainment systems that you'll find in a subcompact SUV. This deal runs until April 30 and allows for a total of 30,000 miles. The lease applies to the Trax LT trim in front-wheel-drive format, and is available in most parts of the country. Get in touch with your local Chevy dealership for additional information. 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe Lease Deal: $209 per month for 36 months with $2,899 due at signing The 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe is a well-rounded SUV that delivers the comfort, space, and safety features that shoppers demand. The standard 187-horsepower four-cylinder engine comes coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. The Santa Fe is notable for coming with a long list of safety features too, which helps add some extra peace of mind. Fuel economy and predicted reliability ratings are also plus points with this accomplished sport-utility. It's no surprise that the Santa Fe took home our 2020 Best 2-Row SUV for the Money award . This deal is for the base-trim Santa Fe equipped with front-wheel drive, and runs from now until May 4. The lease permits 10,000 annual miles. Pricing varies by region, so be sure to contact your local Hyundai dealer to verify pricing and availability. Your credit score will play a role in your eligibility for this offer. 2020 Mazda CX-5 Lease Deal: $239 per month for 36 months with $2,999 due at signing The 2020 Mazda CX-5 is an entertaining compact SUV with a fun-loving nature. Handling is excellent, and the CX-5 loves to zip around corners as its 187-horsepower four-cylinder puts power to the pavement. The cabin has an upscale appearance, thanks to high-quality build materials and well-arranged controls. This deal allows for 36,000 miles and expires on April 30. The offer is for the CX-5 in the Sport trim with front-wheel drive. Standard features include a 7-inch touch screen, two USB ports, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and a rearview camera, among other items. The offer is widely available with minimal variations in pricing, but it's best to confirm pricing and availability in your area by contacting your local Mazda dealer. 2020 Jeep Wrangler Lease Deal: $259 per month for 36 months with $3,099 due at signing When it comes to off-road adventures, few vehicles are better than the 2020 Jeep Wrangler . Fitted with four-wheel drive and solid front and rear axles, the Wrangler is bred for rocky roads and muddy trails. The Unlimited version has the convenience of four doors, which makes it far more accommodating for toting along extra passengers. The Wrangler can be had with a 3.6-liter V6 or turbocharged four-cylinder with 270 and 285 horsepower, respectively. This lease is for the Wrangler Unlimited in entry-level Sport trim. The deal expires April 30 and permits 10,000 annual miles. Similar deals are available nationwide, though this particular price is restricted to the greater New York region. Contact your local Jeep dealership to enquire about availability and exact pricing in your area. 2020 Volkswagen Tiguan Lease Deal: $299 per month for 39 months with $0 due at signing The 2020 Volkswagen Tiguan is another compact SUV with road manners more akin to those of a modern sedan. Nimble and easy to drive, the Tiguan provides a relaxing yet confident experience behind the wheel. Cargo room is in ample supply, with 33 cubic feet of space behind the second row. While a third row is optional, it's very tiny and suitable only for small kids. Powering the Tiguan is a 184-horsepower four-cylinder paired to an eight-speed automatic. There is a choice of front- and all-wheel drive, though this deal is for the base Tiguan S trim equipped with front-wheel drive. Standard features include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a rearview camera, blind spot monitoring, and a Wi-Fi hot spot. This deal allows for 32,500 miles and expires April 30. Pricing varies depending on location, so be sure to contact your local Volkswagen dealership for exact pricing and availability.

AAxYab2	lifestyle	lifestyleroyals	Meet the secret stepsister of Princes William and Harry you never knew about		Just when we thought we knew everything there was to know about Prince William and Prince Harry, a bombshell drops on us   they have a secret stepsister. Well, maybe she's not exactly a "secret" but she has been kept well out of the public eye. When Camilla Parker Bowles married Prince Charles back in 2005, she had two kids from her previous marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles   Tom Parker Bowles and Laura Lopes. And while Tom, 43, spends more time in the public eye (he appeared on Australian cooking show The Hotplate ), Laura, 40, has managed to lead a more low-key existence. Even more surprising than the fact that William, 35, and Harry, 33, have a stepsister though, is the fact they're actually all quite close. Seriously, how did we not know about her? She was even a guest at Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding last weekend. Before that, Laura's 10-year-old daughter Eliza was a flower girl at William and Kate Middleton's 2011 wedding. RELATED VIDEO: The 19 Best Moments From the Royal Wedding [Provided by Brides] In addition to Eliza, Laura is also mum to eight-year-old twin boys, Gus and Louis, with her former Calvin Klein model husband, Harry Lopes, 40. Laura and Harry, who now works as an accountant, got married in 2006 - a year after Charles, 69, and Camilla, 70 tied the knot - and both of her new stepbrothers were on the wedding guest list. Meanwhile, Laura used to work as a correspondent for Tatler magazine, before opening up an art gallery in London. Welcome to the world, Laura - it feels like we just met you.

The 4 Series does not have an overall score or ranking because it has not been fully crash tested. Is the BMW 4 Series a Good Car? Yes, the 2019 BMW 4 Series is a great luxury small car . The 4 Series boasts powerful engine options, lithe handling, and a sumptuous interior with a user-friendly infotainment system. It's also practical, with ample cargo space in all three of its body styles: coupe, convertible, and Gran Coupe (sedan). Factor in a good predicted reliability rating and many available safety features, and there's a lot to like about this BMW. Should I Buy the BMW 4 Series? The 4 Series is worth consideration in this segment, but it won't win over everyone. Its $44,000 starting price is one of the highest in the class. You can find similar performance and refinement from lower-priced rivals like the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Genesis G70 . The same is true of other cars in the BMW family, like the more-affordable BMW 2 Series and 3 Series . Should I Buy a New or Used BMW 4 Series? For 2019, BMW added a handful of standard amenities to the 4 Series. These include front and rear parking sensors, navigation, and Apple CarPlay. All of these features are available in the few model years prior, so you may be better off shopping for a similar 2017 or 2018 BMW 4 Series. An older model will also likely save you thousands of dollars compared to a new BMW 4 Series.

BMW 4 Series Versus the Competition Which Is Better: BMW 4 Series or Audi A5? The Audi A5 ranks near the very top of the luxury small car class . It bests the 4 Series in overall performance, thanks to its standard all-wheel-drive system, which gives the A5 wonderful road grip and handling. Its standard 252-horsepower engine is good for most situations, but you can also upgrade to the high-performance S5 (354 horsepower) or RS5 (444 horsepower). Both of these models also have suspension and performance upgrades for improved driving dynamics. The elegantly designed cabin offers amenities like standard leather seats and the user-friendly MMI infotainment system, which features Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Rounding out the A5's list of positives are great safety scores and an above-average predicted reliability rating. Both the 4 Series and the A5 are available in coupe, convertible, and fastback body styles. The A5 Sportback is the cheapest. It starts at about $2,000 less than the 4 Series Gran Coupe. Both cars are good, but the A5 is slightly better thanks to its stronger performance and nicer interior. Which Is Better: BMW 4 Series or Mercedes-Benz C-Class? The Mercedes-Benz C-Class has one of the nicest interiors in this class, but it will probably appeal to a different set of shoppers than the 4 Series. While the BMW delivers inspired performance, the C-Class is focused more on pampering its occupants with a luxurious ride. Performance is improved with AMG models. They boast between 362 and 503 horsepower and have more aggressive suspension setups. You can buy this Benz as a sedan, coupe, or convertible (also known as a cabriolet). Mercedes C-Class coupe and convertible models have limited rear-seat space and fewer cubic feet of trunk space than the 4 Series. Infotainment features in the C-Class are confusing to learn and operate, in contrast to the fairly straightforward controls in the 4 Series. If you value performance and your budget allows the 4 Series' higher price, go with the BMW. 4 Series Interior How Many People Does the 4 Series Seat? The 4 Series coupe and convertible models seat up to four people, while the larger hatchback Gran Coupe can hold up to five. The driver and front passenger have plenty of room in the standard front sport seats, which feature 10-way power adjustments that make it easy to tailor the seats to your preference. There's good lateral support for spirited driving, and the seats remain plush on long cruises. The back seats are a different story. It's hard to access the second row in the 4 Series coupe or convertible, and a sloping roofline limits headroom. Taller passengers might also want a little more legroom, especially if the front seats are slid back. With its elongated roof and rear doors for easy entry, the Gran Coupe model is more accommodating for rear-seat occupants. 4 Series and Car Seats The BMW 4 Series has two full sets of LATCH car-seat connectors on the rear outboard seats. The middle seat only has an upper tether anchor. In the hatchback Gran Coupe, the tether anchors are located midway on the backs of the seats, and they're easy to find. The lower anchors are located behind plastic flaps, but they sit deep in the seats. 4 Series Interior Quality The cabin of the 2019 4 Series is awash with high-quality, upscale materials befitting the car's nearly $45,000 price tag. Everything is tied together in a sleek and modern design with excellent build quality, fit, and finish. Leatherette upholstery is standard, but you can upgrade to the real thing for another element of elegance. The 4 Series also features wood trim pieces and fancy stitching on many surfaces, such as the dash. 4 Series Cargo Space No matter which of the three body types you go with, you'll get a lot of cargo space compared to competitors. The coupe has 15.7 cubic feet of trunk space, which is great for the class. Even the convertible's 13.1 cubic feet of space is more than what a lot of other coupes or sedans in the segment offer. The 4 Series Gran Coupe is a hatchback that has 17 cubic feet of cargo space with its rear seats up and 45.9 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down. That volume should let you haul small pieces of furniture or even a bicycle. All models come with split-folding rear seats to carry long or bulky items. The Gran Coupe features a standard power trunk lid. 4 Series Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation Standard features in the 2019 4 Series include dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, satellite radio, HD Radio, Bluetooth, a USB port, and the iDrive infotainment system with an 8.8-inch display screen, navigation, and Apple CarPlay. Optional features include Comfort Access keyless entry, a Harman Kardon surround-sound system, wireless charging, and a Wi-Fi hot spot. In addition to a touch screen, iDrive utilizes a physical control knob on the center console to control the car's entertainment and tech offerings. After a slight learning curve, it's pretty user-friendly. The menus are easy to navigate once you're familiar with them, and there are buttons and knobs on the center stack for adjusting the temperature and audio volume from the driver's seat. Notable for the 2019 4 Series (and moving forward with other 2019 BMWs) is the change of Apple CarPlay to a subscription service. Previously, CarPlay compatibility could be added as an optional feature for a one-time fee of a few hundred dollars. Now, BMW includes it as standard with one year of access. After that, you'll have to pay around $80 per year if you want to continue the service. This could be a boon for drivers who may not have been sure about checking the option box before, but it may hurt buyers who plan to keep the car for a long time and will now spend much more in yearly fees. Either way, BMW's process stands in contrast to many other brands (including nonluxury ones) that simply include CarPlay and/or Android Auto as standard equipment with no strings attached. On a positive note, BMW is one of the few auto manufacturers to offer wireless CarPlay. 4 Series Performance 4 Series Engine: Bigger Is Better The base 2019 BMW 430i comes with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that generates 248 horsepower. It's enough to scoot you around town and get up to speed on the highway, but some critics say it sounds coarse and unrefined. For a more satisfying sports car experience, look to the 440i and its 320-horsepower turbocharged six-cylinder engine. Power oozes out as soon as you hit the gas, and BMW claims that the 440i can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. An eight-speed automatic transmission comes standard in all models, but you can opt for a six-speed manual in coupes. Both gearboxes deliver smooth and accurate shifts   the automatic is a little quicker, while the manual has long clutch travel and doesn't rush changing gears. The BMW M4 comes standard with a 425-horsepower twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine and a standard six-speed manual transmission. You can outfit the M4 with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, or a Competition package that boosts horsepower to 444. The M4 rockets from zero to 60 mph in about 4 seconds. 4 Series Gas Mileage: Right in Line With Rivals The standard 2019 430i gets 24 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway with rear-wheel drive and an automatic transmission. Those ratings are the same as the 2018 Audi A5 's best numbers. The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class ' best estimates are 24/33 mpg city/highway. In comparison, 440i coupe and Gran Coupe models earn up to 21/32 mpg city/highway. All-wheel-drive 430i coupe and Gran Coupe models earn 23 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway. The 430i coupe with a manual transmission drops to 21/33 mpg city/highway. The lowest fuel economy numbers in the 4 Series lineup belong to the 440i coupe with a manual transmission: 18/28 mpg city/highway. 4 Series Ride and Handling: Balanced but Classically Sporty The 4 Series boasts all of the sporty driving dynamics and thrilling performance found in the brand's other small cars, like the 2 Series and 3 Series . It has some of the sharpest handling in the class, though sometimes road feedback is lacking. A wide stance and low center of gravity result in little body roll when cornering. You can choose from either rear- or all-wheel drive. There are four adjustable driving modes: Comfort, Eco Pro, Sport, and Sport+. Comfort softens the car's already plush ride to easily handle bumps in the road, while Sport will likely deliver the best balance of athleticism and ease. Ride quality can be a bit stiff with Sport+ mode. Those looking to get the most fun out of their 4 Series models will want to opt for the Track Handling package, which includes variable sport steering, an adaptive M suspension, M Sport brakes, and non-run-flat performance tires. 4 Series Reliability Is the BMW 4 Series Reliable? The 2019 BMW 4 Series earns an above-average predicted reliability rating of four out of five from J.D. Power. BMW 4 Series Warranty BMW covers the 4 Series with a four-year/50,000-mile warranty, which is typical for a luxury vehicle. 4 Series Safety 4 Series Crash Test Results The 2019 BMW 4 Series has not undergone crash testing by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 4 Series Safety Features The 4 Series' standard driver assistance features are similar to what you'd find in many cars   a rearview camera and front and rear parking sensors. However, there's a long list of optional advanced safety equipment, including adaptive headlights, automatic parking assist, side- and top-view cameras, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, pedestrian and forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, speed limit information, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control. Which BMW 4 Series Model Is Right for Me? The BMW 4 Series is available in a multitude of configurations. The lineup includes coupe, four-door Gran Coupe, and convertible body styles. Gran Coupe models are the cheapest, with coupes costing about $200 more. Convertible versions are several thousand dollars more expensive. There are two main trims: the 430i with its four-cylinder engine and the 440i with a six-cylinder engine. Rear-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive adds $2,000 to the starting price of any car. You can mix and match any body style, engine, and drivetrain that you want. All models feature a standard eight-speed automatic transmission, and coupes have a six-speed manual available for no extra charge. The rear-wheel-drive-only BMW M4 has a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine and a standard six-speed manual transmission, while a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is optional. While things like body type, drivetrain, and transmission will depend on your personal preference, the 440i is the best compromise of engine power and performance for the price. You'll likely find it a good fit for everyday driving, and it has gobs of muscle on reserve for when you really want to let loose. BMW 430i The 2019 BMW 430i Gran Coupe retails for $44,600. Standard features include leatherette upholstery, 10-way power-adjustable front sport seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, proximity keyless entry, a nine-speaker audio system, satellite radio, HD Radio, Bluetooth, a USB port, a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, the iDrive infotainment system with an 8.8-inch touch-screen display, navigation, and wireless Apple CarPlay. The Convenience Tier adds heated front seats, lumbar support, and blind spot monitoring for an additional $1,100. The Executive Tier includes the Convenience Tier and adds automatic high beams, adaptive LED headlights, automatic parking assist, and side- and top-view cameras for an additional $3,650. For $500, the Driving Assistance package includes lane departure warning, pedestrian and forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and speed limit information. The $1,700 Track Handling package includes variable sport steering, an adaptive M suspension, and M Sport brakes, along with non-run-flat performance tires. Individual options include leather upholstery ($1,450), a heated steering wheel ($190), heated front seats ($500), heated rear seats ($350), a head-up display ($1,100), wireless charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot ($500), a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound system ($875), blind spot monitoring ($500), and adaptive cruise control ($1,200). BMW 440i The 2019 440i Gran Coupe starts at $51,000. In addition to the six-cylinder engine, it comes with the Harman Kardon sound system. The Convenience and Executive Tiers have the same features that they for the 430i, but they're a little cheaper with the 440i: $850 for the Convenience Tier and $3,400 for the Executive Tier. Other packages and options, and their prices, are about the same between the two trim levels. BMW M4 The 2019 BMW M4 Coupe starts at $69,150 and the M4 Convertible starts at $77,650. Rear-wheel drive and a six-speed manual transmission are standard, and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is optional for $2,900. The Competition package ($4,750) increases horsepower to 444 and upgrades steering, differential, and suspension settings. You can also add carbon ceramic brakes for $8,150.

BBV4fjE	health	causes	34 of the most dangerous things science has strongly linked to cancer	Cancer is everywhere. Here are 34 of the most potent, carcinogenic things you can breathe in, swallow, or be around. Reader, beware.	Cancer is everywhere. Here are 34 of the most potent, carcinogenic things you can breathe in, swallow, or be around. Reader, beware. All cancers are a result of damage or genetic mutations in our DNA. But the many reasons individual cancer cases pop up in people are complex. Some are genetic and passed down from one generation to the next, and others are a result of things in our environment that we inhale , eat , or use. Cancer is the second-most-common cause of death in the United States , after heart disease. It fundamentally affects the way our cells grow and divide, changing them in perverse ways. All cancer is a result of damage or genetic mutations in our DNA. The debilitating class of diseases spreads through a body like an invading army as toxic cells grow relentlessly into unruly tumors. Some cases of cancer are out of our control, determined by genetic defects and predispositions passed down from one generation to the next, or spurred by genetic changes we undergo through our lifetimes. But we also know that breathing in certain substances, eating specific things, and even using some kinds of plastics ups the risk of developing some deadly cancers. Click through the slide show above to learn about some known carcinogens - cancer-causers - and a few more things that scientists are zeroing in on as prime suspects. Sugar Scientists now know that eating too much sweet stuff can not only lead to diabetes but actively damage your cells and increase your risk of developing cancer. But that's not all. New research suggests that sugar may fuel tumor growth in the body because cancer loves to use sugar as fuel. "The hyperactive sugar consumption of cancerous cells leads to a vicious cycle of continued stimulation of cancer development and growth" Johan Thevelein, a Belgian molecular biologist, said when his 2017 study was released . Scientists say that the groundbreaking research gives us a better understanding of how sugar and cancer interact, and that it could one day help create targeted diet strategies for patients. NOW WATCH: The differences that matter between Splenda, Equal, Sweet'N Low, and sugar >> Processed foods Any food that comes in a crinkly plastic wrapper, is industrially sealed, and is designed to last for months without spoiling may be a quick on-the-go fix for a hunger pang, but it's also likely increasing your risk of cancer. Scientists in France recently zeroed in on a link between people who eat more processed foods and those who develop cancer. They're not sure yet whether the problem is the shelf-stabilizing ingredients, the plastic packaging, or some combination of the two. And because their study was correlative, it's possible there's some other hidden factor at work. NOW WATCH: I ate nothing but 'healthy' fast food for a week >> Smoking Though the tobacco industry tried to cover this one up, we've known for years that tobacco smoke contains at least 70 cancer-causing chemicals . And it's not just smokers who are affected: People who inhale secondhand smoke can develop deadly forms of cancer too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says : "Nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or at work increase their risk of developing lung cancer by 20-30%." People who chew tobacco are at increased risk, too. And perhaps vaping, too Research is still slim, given that modern vaping has really only been around since a Chinese inventor created the first e-cigarette in 2003. But the evidence so far doesn't look great. In 2019, scientists tied vaping to an increased risk of lung cancer and potentially bladder cancer in initial research performed in mice . More studies need to be done in people to know for sure, but lung experts are concerned that vaping may contribute to more cancer cases because it promotes inflammation in the lungs and mouth. "I think there's an emerging consensus that the immune cells of the lung are a little bit upset by vaping," Professor Robert Tarran, who studies vaping at the University of North Carolina Marisco Lung Institute, previously told Insider . Tanning and unprotected sun exposure According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, people who use a tanning bed before age 35 increase their risk of developing melanoma by 75%. Regular sun can hurt you, too, so wearing protective clothing and sunscreen and finding shade are good ideas if you're going to be out in the sunshine for more than 15 minutes . Toxic chemicals at work Some people work with cancer-causing substances every day. Those at risk of coming in contact with cancer-causing substances on the job include: • aluminum workers • painters • tar pavers (who come in contact with the carcinogen benzene) • rubber manufacturers • hairdressers who deal with dyes daily (the dyes can contain toxins, including formaldehyde and coal tar ) • nail-salon workers breathing in dangerous fumes The night shift The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies nighttime work as "probably" carcinogenic to people . Scientists think working at night can mess with the body's natural circadian sleep and wake cycles. The CDC has a full list of occupational cancer hazards . Arsenic Arsenic, a natural part of the Earth's crust, is toxic in its inorganic form . It's often found in contaminated drinking water in places like Bangladesh, or in spots where irrigation systems for crops use arsenic water. The World Health Organization says at least 140 million people in 50 countries drink water containing high levels of arsenic. (It's also one of the cancer-causing agents in tobacco.) Charred meat and grilling over an open flame Smoky meats from the grill may be tender and tasty, but they probably also increase your risk of cancer . That's because the muscle meats contain compounds called heterocyclic amines, or HCAs, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. According to the National Cancer Institute , when meats like beef, poultry, or fish are cooked over a hot open flame or pan-fried at high temperatures, the fat and juices they release into the fire spark flames with the dangerous chemicals inside that then cook into the meat we eat. They're not positive that these chemicals cause cancer, but in lab tests they have been found to change DNA in ways that might increase the risk of cancer. Coal Coal miners have for years had higher rates of cancer in their lungs, bladder, and stomach. There's sufficient data to suggest miners who deal with coal gasification or who inhale coal dust can get cancer. Alcohol Regular, heavy alcohol consumption can up your risk of developing several different kinds of cancer , including throat, liver, breast, and colon cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, "the risk of developing cancer increases with the amount of alcohol a person drinks." A 2018 analysis of nearly 600,000 drinkers in 19 high-income countries found that drinking more alcohol is associated with developing all kinds of cancers of the digestive system. Another recent study of alcohol drinkers in 195 countries and territories around the world found that more than one in four alcohol-related deaths in people over age 50 are due to cancer. Diesel exhaust Diesel oil has more than 30 components that can cause cancer, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Salt-cured meat or fish and pickled foods Salt-cured fish, which is popular in China, is high in nitrates and nitrites, known carcinogens in animals that may also cause cancer in humans. The chemical compounds can damage DNA, leading to head and neck cancer. According to Cancer Research UK , "people from China, or with Chinese ancestry living in the UK, have higher rates of nasopharyngeal cancer than other ethnic groups," something that might be because of their diet. Eating lots of pickled foods can also increase your risk of stomach cancer . Fracking Chemicals used in oil fracking that may be released into air and water include the cancer-causers benzene and formaldehyde. Processed meats like ham, bacon, and sausage The World Health Organization says processed meats like hot dogs, ham, bacon, and sausage can contribute to cancer risk. That's because the meat has been treated in some way to preserve or flavor it, such as by salting, curing, fermenting, or smoking. WHO says it's possible that any kind of red meat could be linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer , and there's some evidence to suggest the meat also contributes to pancreatic and prostate cancers, though that evidence is not as strong. A recent roundup of 15 breast-cancer studies found that people who regularly eat more processed meats increase their risk of developing breast cancer by 9%, when compared to people who don't eat very much processed meat at all. Consuming the equivalent of one hot dog or roughly two slices of bacon every day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18% . Though one recent study tried to suggest that red meat consumption isn't as bad for us as previously thought, the lead researcher was later outed by the New York Times for his agribusiness industry connections. Asbestos Asbestos was used as an insulation material for years before the dust was linked to lung cancer. Products that contain asbestos are not completely banned in the US , though the Environmental Protection Agency regulates their use. Glyphosate, a common weed killer used by many farmers You may know the chemical better as an active ingredient in Monsanto 's Roundup. Some studies have suggested that the weed-killer, one of the most common pesticides used on crops in the US, is linked with slightly higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in farmers and gardeners. A group of more than 300 US farmers are suing Monsanto (now part of Bayer ) in federal court, alleging that working with the chemical has given them cancer. In 2019, a jury in California ordered Monsanto to pay over $2 billion to a couple who claimed that using Roundup for 35 years caused them to contract non-Hodgkin lymphoma (a judge later reduced the couple's award to $87 million, saying it was higher than constitutional limits allow .) The company was also ordered by a judge to shell out another $80 million payout to a school groundskeeper who used the weed-killer up to 30 times per year (his payment was also later reduced to closer to $25 million, by a judge who said while the company deserved to be punished, the reduced price tag is more in line with US Supreme Court guidelines.) More than 13,000 similar suits have popped up across the U.S . Bayer argues there's no good evidence the chemical glyphosate causes cancer in people, and often points to large cohort studies of farmers around the world, including a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina that found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and any kind of cancer. (Similar studies have been conducted among farmers in France and Norway .) But that 2017 study did say that chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to the chemical may have been more at-risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than others, and another 2019 study suggested glyphosate may be linked to slightly higher rates of a certain lymphoma (though the authors stressed more research on this topic is needed). Scientists are still not sure there's enough evidence that the trace amounts of the pesticide found in food is harmful to our DNA , but more and more research suggests it's not good for people who are exposed to the chemical day after day , such as farmers and gardeners. It's also bad for butterfly populations . Wood dust Saw-mill workers and cabinetmakers who breathe in lots of dust from cutting and shaping wood regularly are more likely to develop cancers of the sinus and nasal cavity than the average person. Birth control and estrogens Women who start menstruation early or go into menopause later may have an increased risk of breast cancer because they're exposed to more estrogen and progesterone made by the ovaries. Women going through menopause who use a combined estrogen-progestin therapy to help ease their symptoms may also be at a greater risk of developing breast cancer. Using birth-control pills may also increase a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer, though there is some evidence that being on birth control is associated with a reduced risk of developing other cancers, such as endometrial (uterus), colorectal, and ovarian. Viruses Catching certain kinds of viruses can indirectly increase your risk of cancer. That's because, in some situations, viruses trigger genetic changes in cells that can contribute to cancer. The CDC says "some viruses linked to cancer are the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer; hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer; and the Epstein-Barr virus, which may cause a type of lymphoma. Also, the H. pylori bacterium can cause gastric cancer." Your family Some cancer risk is passed down from one generation to the next. Genetic mutations play a key role in about 5% to 10% of all cancers. "Genetic changes that promote cancer can be inherited from our parents if the changes are present in germ cells, which are the reproductive cells of the body (eggs and sperm)," the National Cancer Institute says . For example, certain kinds of breast cancer are a result of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Obesity Obesity can put you at increased risk of developing types of cancers including breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, kidney, and pancreas. But there are things you can do to reduce your risk. Prevention includes eating healthy foods and getting enough physical activity, both of which not only help people maintain a healthy weight and reduce their chances of developing some of those cancers but can ward off depression and boost your mood . Formaldehyde Scientists have known for years that formaldehyde can cause nasal cancer in rats. The preserving agent and disinfectant is used in some glues and building products, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer says it can cause cancer in humans too . Implants Putting foreign objects into your body like silicone breast implants (or other metals and ceramics) can lead to cancer, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer . In August 2019, two women filed a class-action lawsuit against breast implant maker Allergan , a month after the company recalled its Biocell textured implants, which are linked to to breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) - but not to breast cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cites at least 573 reports of BIA-ALCL worldwide , including 33 deaths. The BIA-ALCL diagnosis is still a relatively rare one for implant patients, according to the Mayo Clinic . Air pollution Smoggy air, and the particulates in it, can also lead to cancer. Soot in general isn't great. In London, people started noticing lots of chimney sweeps developing scrotal cancer in the 1770s, and further studies found a link between the backbreaking chimney work and higher cancer rates. Soot inhalation has also been linked to lung, esophageal, and bladder cancers. Disaster sites Breathing air infused with toxic fumes for years at a time can lead to cancer. Scientists have studied New York City firefighters, office workers, and students who returned to downtown Manhattan in the days and weeks after the 9/11 attacks and found that they consistently have higher rates of roughly 70 different types of cancer, including breast, cervical, colon, and lung cancers. According to the federal World Trade Center Health Program count, more than 14,750 firefighters, cops, office workers, and children who were living in or working around downtown Manhattan on 9/11 have cancer. An additional 788 survivors have died from cancer. Likewise, people who lived near the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in Ukraine have developed higher-than-usual rates of lung and thyroid cancers as well as leukemia . Silica Silica is a natural mineral found in sand, stone, and concrete. When construction workers and miners inhale silica particles by cutting, sawing or drilling into rock, it can increase their risk of developing lung cancer . Radiation We know that X-rays and gamma rays can cause cancer . We can also get it from solar UV rays . But one trip to the doctor isn't going to give you cancer. The link between radiation and cancer risk tends to show up in studies of people who've been exposed to high doses of radiation, like people affected by the Chernobyl nuclear accident, and people who have cancer, who are sometimes treated with high doses of radiation. Still, the American Cancer Society cautions that "there is no threshold below which this kind of radiation is thought to be totally safe." Chronic, long-term, DNA-damaging inflammation Chronic inflammation from things like long-term infections, bowel disease, or obesity can all damage a person's DNA and lead to higher cancer rates. Some plastics Plastics can be dangerous, especially when they leach chemicals out through scratches or cracks in a container. BPA is a synthetic estrogen that has been used in many plastics and resins since the 1960s. BPA resins can be used inside products like metal food cans as sealants, while polycarbonate BPA plastics can include water bottles and food storage containers. BPA even shows up on the shiny side of receipt paper to stabilize the ink. While many plastics manufacturers have started labeling their products "BPA-free," there's still a lot of the breast- and prostate-cancer-causing stuff around, and some BPA replacements may be no better for our health. Getting intimate before you've had your HPV shots Human papillomavirus is a common family of sexually transmitted viruses, and it's one of the ones we mentioned earlier that can cause cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 40 different types can be passed through sexual contact. Many forms of the virus go away on their own and are relatively harmless, but others can cause cervical, penile, vaginal, and anal cancers . Even using a condom won't necessarily prevent the spread of HPV, though. That's why the CDC recommends that all boys and girls get the HPV vaccine, ideally before their first sexual encounter . In rare cases, even a kiss can cause cancer About 98% of us will contract the potentially cancer-causing mononucleosis virus by the time we're adults, from kissing someone who has the virus, sharing food or drinks, or coming in close contact with them when they're coughing or sneezing. This Epstein-Barr virus is relatively harmless for most of us, but in rare cases the herpes can lead to higher rates of nose cancers, lymphomas, and stomach cancers. Scalding hot beverages that can burn your tongue Drinking scalding hot beverages that are steamy enough to burn a person's tongue prompt more cases of throat cancer. Scientists have discovered that people who drink super-hot maté, traditionally served piping hot in chilly areas of South America, do have some higher rates of esophageal cancer , and drinking alcohol and smoking can compound the risk. Recently, researchers also discovered that people in northeastern Iran who drank two cups of very hot tea every day were at a 90% higher risk of developing esophageal cancer than their Iranian neighbors who waited for their brew to chill. This cancer risk is relatively small, though, and also fairly easy to avoid. Be kind to your tongue and to your esophagus: Wait a few minutes before you sip hot drinks. Acrylamide The browning of some foods that are cooked at high temperatures - like bread, coffee, or french fries - produces a chemical compound called acrylamide. It happens naturally in a process called the Maillard reaction. The dose of acrylamide in a toasty cup of coffee or a chewy cookie is probably not going to kill you. It's dangerous when consumed in large doses, and it's one of the toxic chemicals smokers inhale, but there's no evidence that a little browning is harmful . Though a California judged ruled in 2018 that coffee sellers in that state must include labels warning their customers about the possible cancer risks from acrylamide in coffee, the state later reversed course, after California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment reviewed the scientific evidence to date on coffee and concluded that drinking coffee does "not pose a significant risk of cancer ." In fact, both the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the American Cancer Society say scientific research suggests coffee is more likely a cancer fighter, as it can reduce people's risk of developing certain cancers in the breast, liver, and colon Acrylamide is just one of more than 1,000 chemicals on a list that the state of California has on its danger list of potentially cancer-causing compounds. (By law, California puts cancer warnings on all kinds of things, from parking decks to dentists' chairs.) While it is true that what we eat, where we go, and the things we breathe in every day can contribute to our chances of developing certain types of cancer, it's important to remember the class of debilitating and deadly diseases is not yet fully understood, and scientists are still hunting for cancer cures . Update: This story was first published in 2018. It has been updated periodically with new information.

AAAFdFZ	lifestyle	lifestylehoroscope	The 5 Most Manipulative Zodiac Signs: Are You One Of Them?	These 5 are the most manipulative zodiacs	These 5 are the most manipulative zodiacs 1. Scorpio Scorpio is the most manipulative zodiac sign While the Scorpion may be small, be careful of its sting! Scorpios are some of the most mysterious people out there, but everybody should know how manipulative they can be . Scorpios channel their emotions differently to the other water signs   they are highly passionate and determined people who will stop at nothing if feel they've been done wrong , manipulation included . Their resourceful and jealous nature s means they'll make the most of each of your weaknesses. They sometimes end up going too far but their sense of self-importance usually stops them from seeing that until it's too late. 2. Libra Libra is a master manipulator As the zodiac the most concerned with equality and justice , it may be odd to see Libra on this list. Little do you know, Libras are one of the most manipulative signs of them all. While their ultimate concern is harmony , they'll say or do exactly what people want to hear or see in order to gain everyone's favor . Their problem is that they don't like picking sides and will therefore play devil's advocate to everyone without every getting involved. As one of the least honest zodiac signs , they aren't afraid to say a lie here and there, if it means they avoid confrontation and people's distaste. 3. Gemini Gemini knows how to get what they want Another zodiac known to lie makes our top 3 on the list, as Gemini is another expert at manipulating people. Their communicative prowess lulls people into a false sense of security which makes them feel like they can let down their guard. Revealing all to a Gemini can be a risky move as you re never sure which version of them you re getting each day. Their highly fickle nature means they may suddenly decide, on whim, to use your secrets as leverage . 4. Cancer Cancer use emotional manipulation This particular zodiac's form of manipulation differs a bit from the others on this list. As the highly sentimental individuals that Cancers are, they tend to become victims of their own emotions , moving from one state to another state. As a result of this, Cancers usually require tolerant and understanding people around them, but they seem to take these qualities for granted at times. While they may be trying their best, Cancers will still feel that they aren't receiving the appropriate care from them and will feel emotional manipulation is the only way to make this point clear. 5. Virgo Virgo are smart manipulators Even though you may think of them being a bit cold and distant , Virgos are in fact very sensitive people who just never open up about their emotions quickly. They may never show it externally but they can get very caught up by criticism , especially if it's something they noticed in themselves. As one of the smartest zodiacs , Virgos know exactly how to outsmart and manipulate others they want to get back at. Their perfectionist attitude extends to manipulation - they'll step-by-step plan out a whole scenario to put you in the worst possible position, without you seeing it coming.

The "it" was a 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Holiday Coupe with the W-31 option.	"I was shocked when I saw it," Jimmy McKeague said. The "it" was a 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Holiday Coupe with the W-31 option. A W-31 is not the same as a big-block W-30, but it's still a real W-Machine with a fiberglass hood with functional ram air feeding a 325hp 350 purposely built by Oldsmobile for enthusiasts. These cars are very rare and attract owners with erudite knowledge of Oldsmobile muscle. Dabblers or flippers in the muscle car hobby would likely mistake the unique W-31 350 as a common GM V-8 fitted with a four-barrel. Jimmy is a mile deep in knowledge and an inch wide in focus. That's why, in 2013, he noticed a post on the classicoldsmobile.com forum from Andy Wenz of Cleveland. Andy was asking for information about how to fix the harmonic balancer on the 350 in his 1970 Cutlass, a detail Jimmy recognized as "a rare part that only came on the W-31 cars." Jimmy, already a W-31 owner, informed Andy that his 1970 Oldsmobile was a W-31. At first Andy considered selling. Later he decided to hold on to the car, which his father ordered new in 1970. The two kept in contact, and in January 2018, Jimmy made an appointment to look at the Oldsmobile. His intentions were not focused on a purchase, as the car was still not for sale. Jimmy wanted to finally see the rare Oldsmobile in person, at which time he could "help educate Andy on what he had." When Jimmy arrived at Andy's garage, instead of walking directly to look under the sheet covering the car, he made a beeline for a washing machine covered with car parts and paperwork. "Unless you have a paper trail, it's next to impossible to say this is a true W-31 factory car," he says. That's when he found himself immersed in a W-31 time capsule in this rural Ohio garage. Andy's father, John, bought this W-31 brand new, then parked it in his house this house in 1984. When John sold the house to Andy, the Oldsmobile went with the deal. But what, exactly, was this car other than a Cutlass S two-door hardtop with a 350 under the striped hood? Jimmy was astounded to find an old color print that John's mother had taken at the dealership where she picked up the car brand new. It was in a pile of paperwork that included the original title, Protect-O-Plate, broadcast card, dealer invoice, and receipts from the 1970s when the motor was rebuilt. As the Olds' story started to unfold, it became more about the family's history than just a car collector's dream W-Machine. "History really makes these cars become that much more interesting," Jimmy says. Oldsmobile built the W-31 as "somewhat of an insurance-beater," or a "junior supercar" with engine parts "hand-picked" for a "blueprinted" build, he says. "A lot of people will tell you back in the day this car, with the 3.91 stock rearend, would keep up with the W-30 at the track. It's no slouch, and a W-31 has run 12.80 quarter-miles at the Pure Stock Drags with a ridiculously low gear of 4.66. It is a small-block screamer. That's part of how they advertised it." Andy's father was in the military in Rhode Island when this car arrived, and thus his mom picked it up new. John had a tri-power 1966 Olds 4-4-2 stolen, so he got this W-31 in a less flashy package. Pulling off the sheet revealed a Twilight Blue W-31 that Jimmy marveled was "original and hadn't been touched in years," right down to the original Goodyear Polyglas tires on stock rims. He couldn't resist asking if Andy was interested in selling, and was surprised when Andy said yes. The W-31 was filled with day-two parts, such as a vintage MSD box, an ACCEL Super Coil, headers, a high-stall converter, red airbags in the springs, a Sun Tach, and gauge pod. The one major detraction from the car was a missing carburetor that Jimmy says is "probably the hardest W-31 part to find." The Rochester Quadrajet, PN 7040255 and specific to the W-31 automatic and manual transmission cars, is very valuable. As a longtime collector, though, Jimmy had a spare "255" carburetor. Realizing that Jimmy was the right person to restore and save its history, Andy sold the W-31 to him. Follow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter

BBLCOcI	finance	finance-real-estate	The California law renters want repealed, explained	Los Angeles lawmakers are calling on the state to suspend the law amid the coronavirus pandemic	For for first the time in history, California has implemented rent control statewide . But it has an old law on the books that curbs how individual cities and counties implement rent control at the local level. That law is known as the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act. Established in 1995, it sets limits on the kind of rent control policies cities are able to impose. Right now, more than a dozen places statewide have their own rent control policies many of them stricter and more comprehensive than the new state law. In the LA area, rent control policies exist in communities in unincorporated Los Angeles County , along with the cities of Culver City, Inglewood, Los Angeles, Santa Monica , and West Hollywood . There has been movement among tenants right advocates to repeal Costa Hawkins to give the cities the ability to expand and strengthen their rent control policies. Now as the COVID-19 pandemic pummels the economy forcing many Angelenos out of work, a half dozen Los Angeles City Councilmembers are joining the chorus and calling for the California governor to suspend Costa Hawkins . Unless Costa Hawkins is lifted, several councilmembers say they do not have the authority to stop landlords of buildings that are not rent-controlled from hiking rents. "Costa Hawkins has kept cities like Los Angeles from protecting our tenants for too long," says councilmember David Ryu. "In a pandemic, this is the least we can do. No one should face a rent hike during this emergency." There's also a statewide ballot initiative called the "Rental Affordability Act" that would repeal Costa Hawkins and is eligible for the ballot in the November 2020 election . The initiative is similar to Proposition 10 , which California voters rejected in 2018 . But the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is backing the initiative , says the language of the measure will be clearer this time. Amid a statewide shortage of affordable housing , supporters say repealing Costa Hawkins will give cities important new tools to protect affordable housing. But opponents argue it could worsen the crisis. Given the new level of scrutiny over the bill, here's a short explainer of what Costa Hawkins actually means for California residents. What is Costa Hawkins? Costa Hawkins is a state law that sets some requirements for the cities in California with rent control the city of Los Angeles included. There are three main provisions: It protects a landlord's right to raise the rent to market rate on a unit once a tenant moves out. It prevents cities from establishing rent control or capping rent on units constructed after February 1995. It exempts single-family homes and condos from rent control restrictions. The state bill also prevents cities from updating date-of-construction provisions in ordinances in place at the time of its passage. The city of Los Angeles's main rent control law is the Rent Stabilization Ordinance , or RSO, passed in 1979. It restricts rent control to units built prior to October 1978, a date frozen in place by Costa Hawkins. Under the RSO, yearly rent increases are capped at 3 to 8 percent, but landlords who own buildings constructed after 1978 are subject only to California's new restrictions on rent gouging . The state bill limits yearly rent increases to 5 percent, plus the local rate of inflation (which averaged 2.5 percent in Los Angeles County between 2001 and 2018). In years when the rate of inflation is particularly high, rent hikes are capped at 10 percent. The bill was adopted in 1995 to reign in rent control in five California cities, including Santa Monica and West Hollywood. Those five cities had what's called vacancy control, which is when a unit's rent is capped even after a tenant moves out. Costa Hawkins was also a key part of a 2009 court decision that struck down LA's requirement that developers include affordable units in many new apartment buildings. The courts said that Los Angeles's rules violated Costa Hawkins by mandating lower rents for newly constructed units. A bill signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2017, however, restores the ability of California cities to make developers include affordable units in new rental projects. What would happen if it were repealed? In the short term, not much. Assemblymember Richard Bloom, who introduced a failed repeal bill in 2017, has said that getting rid of Costa Hawkins would only give local governments greater flexibility when setting rent control policies. Cities would still need to go through the process of passing new legislation before the repeal would have any effect. In an effort to preserve affordable housing, some cities might expand rent control regulations to prevent landlords from raising rent on a unit to market rate once a tenant moves out as. The city of Santa Monica, for example, estimates that because of Costa Hawkins, as many as 500 units reset to market rate every year. Why not repeal it and see what happens? Opponents of a repeal argue that Costa Hawkins puts sensible restrictions on local policies that affect the state's overall housing market. A 2016 report from the Legislative Analyst's Office found that expanding rent control "likely would discourage new construction" by limiting the profitability of new rental housing. Opponents say this could exacerbate a statewide housing shortage and scare off developers worried about sudden policy changes in cities with rent control. The report also predicts that stricter rent control rules would encourage discriminatory behavior on the part of landlords when selecting tenants. What do those in favor of repeal say? Supporters say that city leaders should be given the tools to protect tenants in the midst of a severe affordable housing crisis (a 2019 report from the California Housing Partnership Corporation found a shortfall of more than 500,000 affordable units in Los Angeles alone). They also say policies at both the state and federal level already exist to ensure rent control regulations don't prevent landlords from receiving a "fair return" on their properties. Protections for tenants facing stiff rent increases, on the other hand, remain slim in most of the state. Bloom and Assemblymember David Chiu, who co-authored the 2017 repeal bill, argued at the time that new construction alone would not be enough to make housing affordable to tenants now being priced out of expensive cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. What's next? With enormous opposition from landlords and their representatives, supporters of the repeal measure face an uphill battle. Given the small number of California cities that actually impose rent control requirements, they may also have a tough time convincing voters outside those cities that they should care. Still, with rising housing costs around the state, the number of cities with rent control has increased in the last couple of years.

BBId9nm	finance	personalfinance	10 signs you're actually a cheapskate	Here are some ways you might be taking frugal living too far.	Here are some ways you might be taking frugal living too far. 10 Signs You're Actually a Cheapskate While there's value in being frugal, sometimes you can take it too far   and for little savings. Whether you engage in five-finger discounts or take more than your share of mints from the communal bowl, at the end of the day you're simply stealing from business owners and sullying your image. Are your frugal habits too extreme? Click through to find out if you're really a tightwad . The Hotel Heist Toiletries are among the many free luxuries frequent travelers enjoy . However, thrifty folks sometimes cross the line by stealing extra soaps and shampoo bottles to take home. If you have a habit of hitting up the housekeeper's cart for extra bars of soap, you're not only scamming the hotel, you're also wasting your time. After all, the savings on a sliver of soap are hardly worth writing home about. Your savings: You can buy a 12-ounce bottle of shampoo for as little as 94 cents and a package of three bars of soap for about $2. Since you're getting at least five times the amount of product when you buy these items in stores, the savings are minimal. Expect to pocket 20 cents or less for every tiny toiletry you nab. If you can't resist the temptation, see what other hotel freebies you can score on your next trip . The Continental Cheap-Out Speaking of hotels, there's usually plenty of food to be found at the continental breakfast. With Feeding America estimating that 72 billion pounds of food go to waste each year in the U.S., there's no shame in clearing your plate or even going back for seconds at the buffet. Most hotels don't mind if you grab some fruit or yogurt to go, either. But you don't want to be the person who comes to breakfast carrying a Tupperware container to fill with food to stash in your hotel fridge. It's not a good look. Your savings: You'll save about 42 cents per apple and 20 cents per banana. On average, you can nab a pound of the latter for just 44 cents at the grocery store. Use These Savings Strategies: 20 Secret Ways to Save on Your Next Hotel Stay The Supermarket Sweep Everyone loves free samples. For some reason, food on a toothpick is just more appealing. However, sweeping the supermarket five times to fill up on freebies isn't an acceptable replacement for lunch. It's just being cheap. And if you're really focused on frugal living, remember that the entire point of samples isn't to save you money   it's to entice you to spend more . Your savings: The value of this cheap trick depends on how much you sample and where you shop. However, the small portion sizes make savings minuscule. And at sample paradise Costco, you could get a real lunch at the food court instead of scouring the store for freebies. A quarter-pound hot dog or Polish sausage and a 20-ounce soda will cost you just $1.50. Cream, Sugar and Thievery Whether you're visiting the local gas station or hanging out in a hip cafe, indulging in all the coffee fixings is one of life's little pleasures. From creamers to sweet syrups, raw sugar to honey, the flavor options at a coffee bar are far more extensive than the ones found in your kitchen   and they're a great way to save on coffee at Starbucks . However, sticking a handful of creamer cups in your purse won't help pad your wallet in the long run. Moreover, you'll be selling your dignity for chump change. Your savings: You can purchase a box of 50 brand-name, flavored coffee creamers for $6.99. So, for each creamer you pocket, you're adding no more than 14 cents to your net worth. The Glassware Grab Most of the time, what happens at the bar stays at the bar. That truth applies to awkward dating fails, dancing on tables and even spilling your umbrella-adorned drink on your lap. However, it doesn't apply to stealing. If you're drinking at your local watering hole, taking home the glassware is a good way to ruin your reputation with your bartender. Alternatively, by treating your bartender well, you might be able to score free shots or drinks from time to time. Complimentary booze is worth more than a couple of cheap cocktail glasses. Your savings: If you're frugal, get your glassware from discount stores such as Dollar Tree or the 99 Cents Only Stores. Whether you want tumblers, wine glasses or mugs, you can get them for $1 a pop. And they haven't been used by 10,000 barflies before you. Bad Tipping The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 2.6 million people worked as waiters and waitresses in the U.S. in 2016. In many states, those same servers earn less than $5 per hour   and they make just $2.13 in 17 states. In light of those numbers, there's a good chance the server who brings your meal is depending on the tip you give to pay the bills. When you don't tip, you're essentially stealing money out of his or her pocket. Avoid being that person and follow proper tipping etiquette when dining out . Your savings: According to CNN Money, the standard tip amount is 15 percent for adequate service, 20 percent for very good. However, if you can afford to eat out, you can afford to tip. The Condiment Cadre Most of us have some extra condiment packets floating in our junk drawers. And if you find an extra hot sauce or mustard packet in the bottom of your fast-food bag, there's nothing wrong with keeping it for a rainy day. However, jamming two handfuls of sauce packets into your pocket every time you go out to eat is basically stealing. Similarly, if you have a whole drawer dedicated to condiment packets taken from restaurants, you likely have a cheapskate problem. Your savings: If you prefer getting your ketchup from a plastic packet, you will be glad to learn you can score a box of 500 from an online restaurant supplier for just $7.19. Or you could keep walking away with them and saving yourself 1.4 cents per packet. A Handful of Mints If you think you might be a little too frugal, avoid grabbing free mints and hard candies by the handful. Whether you're at the bank or your favorite local eatery, it's wise to abide by the rule of one mint per person. After all, the business is being kind by offering complimentary candy, and your mom probably taught you not to take advantage of kindness. Your savings: When you need more than one mint, buy a 10-ounce bag of them from your local dollar store. If the average hard candy weighs about half an ounce, you're saving just 5 cents per mint by pocketing them. Try not to spend it all in one place. Get Free Stuff: 75 Things You Can Get for Free Penny-Pinching Pens Some pens are meant to be taken. In fact, companies use pens emblazoned with their logos to advertise their services. However, you shouldn't take a handful of these writing instruments or, worse, nab the one that your friendly neighborhood bank teller was using before your arrival. Not only is it wrong to take things that don't belong to you, but the savings on this five-finger discount are basically zilch. Your savings: Most pens found at businesses are basic ballpoints, not luxury writing tools. You can get a box of a dozen Bic pens for about $2.50, so nabbing one from an unsuspecting office worker saves you an average of only 20 cents. Lifted Literature There's nothing wrong with reading that Vogue fashion article at the dentist's office or scanning the headlines over lunch at your local diner. However, the fact that these businesses provide free periodicals doesn't make it OK for you to stick them in your bag to read at home. Moreover, lifting literature such as magazines, books and newspapers saves you less money than just about any other habit you might try to pass off as frugal living. Your savings: None. You can read news online for nothing and access hundreds of free e-books. If you don't like reading on a screen, consider getting a library card. Your local book paradise can order almost any book or magazine you desire   for free. Up Next: Free Things to Do in Every State
BBLHEz5	news	newsscienceandtechnology	The best indoor plants for cleaner air	Adding plants to your home doesn't require a green thumb. Here are a few best bets for your space.	If you're yearning to bring the outside in, a simple set of houseplants can do just that. Houseplants add color, style and an earthy warmth to interior spaces, and contrary to popular belief, anyone can brighten up their home or office with a plant. You don't need a green thumb to keep indoor plants alive. What is a USDA hardiness zone? | Build a garden and grow your own food during the coronavirus outbreak The key is selecting plants that thrive in your specific environment. Whether you're working with limited natural light, a busy schedule or musty air that needs purifying, there are plenty of plant options out there to meet your needs. Plants for cleaner air Multiple studies have proven certain plants are able to absorb polluting, organic compounds like formaldehyde and benzene through their leaves and roots. That absorbing purifies the air around the plant. In fact, a NASA study highlighted several plants that excelled in cleaning the air around them. If you're looking to breathe easier, but don't want to purchase an air purifier , opt for one of these plants for their ability to improve indoor air quality. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum) Named for the white blooms reminiscent of a surrender flag, these budding beauties remove formaldehyde, benzene and carbon monoxide from the air around them. Peace lilies can grow up to 16 inches tall and don't need direct sunlight, but they do require regular watering. English Ivy (Hedera helix) According to NASA's study, English Ivy is a fantastic plant to grow indoors if you're looking for air-filtering ability. It's great for pet owners, since it's been proven to reduce the amount of airborne fecal matter. However, it should be kept out of the reach of any pets, as it can be poisonous if ingested. English Ivy also absorbs formaldehyde, found in some household cleaners. Gerbera Daisy (Gerbera jamesonii) This bright and colorful flower packs a pollutant-absorbing punch, filtering out trichloroethylene and benzene. Gerbera Daisies do need plenty of direct sunlight, so keep it in a well-lit area and be sure to water frequently. Plants for low light Just because you live in a space with limited natural light that doesn't mean you can't enjoy plants inside your home. These shade-loving varieties make the perfect addition to any home, especially if it's low on light. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata) Named for its long, straight leaves, this super-tolerant plant doesn't need direct sunlight or frequent watering to survive. It's easy to keep alive and can grow up to 12 inches tall. The Snake Plant also releases oxygen at night, unlike most plants which release it during the day. That makes it a great plant for a bedroom, and it could even help you sleep better. Moth Orchid (Phalaenopsis Blume) These exotic-looking flowers are actually quite simple to grow. They don't require direct sunlight and you should allow the soil to dry out in between watering. That means you won't need to remember to water very often. These plants come in two standard sizes, an under 12-inch variety and a variety that reaches between 18 and 24 inches tall. Moth Orchid blooms can last for up to four months and are perfect for low-light locations. Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) Also known as Devil's Ivy, this strong-willed, climbing plant can survive in plenty of indoor lighting conditions. In the jungle, it can grow up to 40 feet long, but will probably do better in your home as a hanging or potted plant. Golden Pothos don't require a lot of light and prefer partly shady environments. They're exceptionally hardy and add bright, cheery greenery to any interior. MiracleGro Aerogarden Bounty Elite makes indoor gardening simple Plants for less watering Let's face it, keeping anything alive is a time-consuming responsibility. Sometimes watering your plants will simply slip your mind. Not to worry. If you forget to water your plants for a few days or take a vacation, these plants will forgive you. They can withstand a few days, even a week in some cases, with no harm done. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum) The sprawling Spider Plant is rarely thirsty. In fact, it can go a week or more without H2O , thanks to its tube-like roots that store nutrients. Still, if you see the leaf tips begin to turn brown, it's time to give it a drink. The best way to store and display a Spider Plant is in a hanging basket or a tall planter, so the long leaves can dangle over the side. When it comes to light, the Spider Plant prefers indirect light, not too bright and not in complete shade. ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) This tongue-twister of a plant is nearly indestructible. It can tolerate plenty of different lighting conditions and go without water for long periods of time. Its bright green leaves are thick and waxy to help conserve water. Overwatering could be this plant's biggest enemy. It's also important to keep the leaves free of dust, so an occasional wipe with a damp cloth or paper towel will go a long way in keeping your ZZ plant healthy. Perfect for interior spaces, and it's a great plant for travelers. Succulent family (Echeveria) Succulents are mega-popular in interior design these days, accenting desks, kitchens and everywhere in between. While they do require a decent amount of natural light (most prefer full, direct sun), plants in the succulent family don't need much water at all. Like the ZZ Plant, there's more risk in overwatering than underwatering. Succulents come in dozens of varieties with a wide array of beautiful colors, shapes and sizes. No matter your schedule or how sunny your home is, there are great indoor plant options out there for your environment. Even if your thumb isn't the greenest, these indoor-friendly plants will thrive in your home's climate, maybe even improve it and look good, all at the same time.

AAx8xEK	foodanddrink	foodnews	40 Most Popular Discontinued Snack Foods	Much like fashion trends, hairstyles, and essentially any kind of product, the popularity of snack foods comes and goes.	Much like fashion trends, hairstyles, and essentially any kind of product, the popularity of snack foods comes and goes. Much like fashion trends, hairstyles, and essentially any kind of product, the popularity of snack foods comes and goes. It s downright disheartening to find out that snacks we savored during childhood are no longer in existence. Even though a snack may have appeared to be popular, companies often choose to discontinue a product if it s not as profitable as other snacks produced under the company name, or just isn t profitable in general. Hungry for nostalgia? The team at 24/7 Wall St. did some digging and found the most beloved snack items that have been discontinued. To identify the 40 most popular discontinued snacks, 24/7 Wall St. collected the names of as many as possible snacks that were sold and discontinued at some point in the United States. We used various internet sources, including food company websites, blogs, and online forums. A snack was defined as a food typically consumed between meals. Side orders and drinks were not considered. To make the list, snack items needed to have at least 9,000 Wikipedia page views between May 6, 2016 and May 6, 2018. Pageviews of the snack makers were used as a proxy for the popularity of snacks that did not have Wikipedia pages. While ranking the popularity of discontinued snacks was not possible with the data available, all of these snacks are relatively popular. Prevalence of Facebook pages and petitions on Change.org made specifically for the revival of the snack food helped us further verify the popularity of these products. A few of the snacks on this list were once discontinued but were brought back by popular demand. 1. Triple Power Push Pops > Introduced: 1986 > Discontinued: 2000s > Maker: Topps Sugar-crazed teens in the '80s and '90s more than likely had a Triple Power Push Pop stashed in their backpack, and possibly half-eaten. Thanks to its cylindrical container and slidable lollipop, the treat was perfect for storage. The product has been absent from store shelves since the early 2000s, but you can still find the sweet treat on Amazon. 2. Butterfinger BB's > Introduced: 1992 > Discontinued: 2006 > Maker: Nestlé Butterfinger BB's, the same as the candy bar but in mini-ball form, made for the perfect movie theater snack. The bite-sized candy was discontinued in 2006, just three years before Butterfinger Bites were released. Still, avid fans of the BB's agree that the Bites don't provide the same teeth-sticking, chocolate-coated finger experience. ALSO READ: Hottest Businesses to Franchise in America 3. Mr. T Cereal > Introduced: 1980s > Discontinued: 1984 > Maker: Quaker Oats Company Quaker Oats Company launched Mr. T cereal in 1984 in honor of actor and professional wrestler Laurence Tureaud's persona, Mr. T. While Mr. T was popular for several years, the cereal inspired by him was certainly not. Quaker Oats Company only produced the crispy sweet corn and oats cereal for one year. 4. Crispy M&M's > Introduced: 1999 > Discontinued: 2005 > Maker: Mars Originally intended as a limited edition item, Crispy M&M's were gone from shelves in 2005. But they were such a hit during their six years on the market that customer pressure for their return was strong. Mars brought the crunchy M&M's back in 2015. ALSO READ: States With the Most Gun Violence 5. Cinna-Crunch Pebbles > Introduced: 1998 > Discontinued: 2001 > Maker: Post Cinna-Crunch Pebbles may have been discontinued just three years after its inception, but that didn't stop Post from reviving the concept 16 years later. In 2017, Post released Cinnamon Pebbles -- with the same iconic Flintstone characters dancing about the box cover. The rice cereal is said to taste similar to a churro. 6. Giggles Cookies > Introduced: 1980s > Discontinued: 1990s > Maker: Nabisco The happy face cookies, which would likely be branded as an emoji cookie today, was called Giggles Cookies back in the '80s. Each Giggles was made of two shortbread cookies with fudge and vanilla cream smothered between them, Oreo-style. While they sound delicious, they only lasted on the market for about a decade. ALSO READ: States With the Longest and Shortest Life Expectancy 7. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtle Pies > Introduced: 1991 > Discontinued: 1993 > Maker: Hostess Fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles likely have fond memories of these snack-sized pudding pies. While not the most aesthetically pleasing treat, the vanilla pudding enveloped in a sugary green crust was a hit among young children. Unfortunately, not even the most staunch fans could keep the product alive, and the pudding pies only lasted two years on the market. 8. Reese's Elvis Cups > Introduced: 2007 > Discontinued: 2008 > Maker: The Hershey Company Labeled "Collector Edition," Hershey released an Elvis Presley-inspired Reese's Cup in 2007. This special edition was filled with peanut butter and bananas in honor of the King of Rock's favorite sandwich. The limited-time-only treat left the building in 2008. ALSO READ: 20 Companies Profiting the Most From War 9. Nintendo Cereal > Introduced: 1988 > Discontinued: 1989 > Maker: Ralston Cereals Gamers surely appreciated this cereal when it was in existence. The Nintendo Cereal System, as it was officially called, had two kinds of colorful cereal in each box, one for Super Mario Brothers and one for Legend of Zelda. The cereal, though, was not nearly as big a hit as the actual gaming device, and production came to a permanent halt just one year after its inception. 10. Hershey's Bar None > Introduced: 1987 > Discontinued: 1997 > Maker: The Hershey Company Hershey's Bar None was introduced to the world in 1987. The chocolate cream-filled wafers were sprinkled with crushed peanuts and doused in a layer of milk chocolate. It's no wonder that its slogan was "tame the chocolate beasty." Bar None started to lose popularity after Hershey added caramel to the candy and split it into two bars. By 1997, the treat slipped into obscurity.

Keebler Fudge Magic Middles > Introduced: 1980s > Discontinued: 1994 > Maker: The Keebler Company Launched sometime in the '80s, Keebler Fudge Magic Middles were sensational while they were for sale. Produced by the Keebler Company, the magic of this snack was the chocolate fudge cream filling inside a shortbread cookie crust. Another variation even had a peanut butter-flavored crust. Both flavors got the boot from the company's production line by the mid '90s. 12. Hostess Chocodiles > Introduced: 1980s > Discontinued: 1999 > Maker: Hostess The Chocodile debuted in the '80s, gaining popularity as the chocolate-covered Twinkie. The beloved Hostess product got its unique name from the snack's original mascot, Chauncey Crocodile. To many's delight, Chocodiles' 15-year hiatus came to an end in 2014 when Hostess decided to revive the product in tiny fun-size form. ALSO READ: States Where Americans Are Paying the Most Taxes 13. French Toast Crunch > Introduced: 1995 > Discontinued: 2006 > Maker: General Mills There's French toast, and then there's General Mills French Toast Crunch. What's the difference? Honestly, despite coming in cereal form, there isn't much difference flavor-wise. Devoted fans have incessantly tweeted at General Mills, requesting the company bring back the cereal ever since it was discontinued in 2006. The company finally caved and rebooted the cereal in 2015 in its original fashion. 14. Black Pepper Jack Doritos > Introduced: 2003 - 2004 > Discontinued: 2008 > Maker: Frito-Lay Debuting sometime between 2003 and 2004, Black Pepper Jack Doritos hooked many Doritos fans nationwide, much like any non-traditional Doritos flavors do. These nacho cheese-flavored chips with a kick were not on store shelves for long as Frito-Lay ceased production by 2008. ALSO READ: Cities Where Crime Is Soaring in Every State 15. Carnation breakfast bars > Introduced: 1970s > Discontinued: 1993 > Maker: Nestlé It's unclear as to what year Carnation breakfast bars popped up, but there are advertisements of the snack dating back to 1973. Back in the '70s, Carnation breakfast bars were advertised in magazines as "The Hip Pocket Meal." The chocolate-covered oat bar has been off the shelves for about 25 years now, but who's to say Nestlé won't ever bring it back? 16. Planters Cheez Balls > Introduced: 1980s > Discontinued: 2006 > Maker: Planters If you thought Planters was only famous for its nut selections, think again. Planters Cheez Balls were a long-time hit. While it's not clear when the cheesy bite-size wonders were first introduced, there were commercials advertising the salty snack back in the early '80s. Planters discontinued the product in 2006, and like many discontinued products, there have been several online petitions pleading for the company to bring the Cheez Balls back. ALSO READ: 100 Most Popular Musicians on Tour This Year! 17. Cröonchy Stars > Introduced: 1988 > Discontinued: 1989 > Maker: Post Cröonchy Stars only lasted one year on the market before falling into obscurity. While the box cover was amusing, with The Muppet Show's Swedish Chef proudly holding his bowl of Cröonchy Stars, the cereal itself seemed to have fallen short among other cinnamon-flavored cereals. Cröonchy Stars' biggest competitor was likely Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which had already been stealing the hearts -- or tastebuds -- of many. 18. Jell-O Pudding Pops > Introduced: 1979 > Discontinued: 1993 > Maker: Jell-O For a long time, Jell-O's ice cold Pudding Pops were the go-to summer treat, especially for '80s kids. The product may not have appeared in freezer aisles until 1979, but the idea was first conceptualized in 1967, when Jell-O advertised using its pudding mix in recipes that churned out frozen goodies. Ready-made Pudding Pops lasted on the market for about 14 years, primarily advertised by the now-infamous Bill Cosby, before they were discontinued.

Jumpin' Jack Cheese Doritos > Introduced: 1990 > Discontinued: Early 1990s > Maker: Frito-Lay Jumpin' Jack Cheese Doritos were introduced in 1990 in a commercial by Jay Leno, which immediately sparked their popularity. However, even a well-known TV personality and comedian couldn't keep the Monterey Jack-flavored chips going. The chips disappeared from shelves sometime in the early '90s, but they did make a brief comeback in 2013 as a limited edition throwback flavor. 20. Life Savers Holes > Introduced: 1990 > Discontinued: 1990s > Maker: Nabisco Though Life Savers products are produced by candy giant Mars, Life Savers Holes were originally made by Nabisco. Life Savers Holes may have been adored by many, but due to packaging issues, the product was voluntarily recalled just one year after its inception. Some customers had reportedly bit off the plastic caps of the candies' cylindrical container. The recall was temporary, and the product was still sold throughout most of the '90s. ALSO READ: How Bad Is the Flu Season in Every State? 21. Pop-Tarts Crunch > Introduced: 1994 > Discontinued: 1995 > Maker: Kellogg Company Since the '60s we've come to know and love Pop-Tarts pastries, but Pop-Tarts Crunch -- the pastries in bite-sized cereal form -- is a different story. Kellogg launched the cereal in the fall of 1994, advertised as "Pop-Tarts for your spoon." The cereal came in two flavors, brown sugar cinnamon and strawberry. Those classic, and very profitable, flavors of the Pop-Tarts pastries did not do well for the cereal. The product left shelves, never to return, just one year later. 22. Wonka Oompas > Introduced: 1971 > Discontinued: 1983 > Maker: Quaker Oats Company Candy aficionados from the '70s and the '80s will remember this Willy Wonka product. Oompas were like the Reese's Pieces or Peanut Butter M&M's of today, with colorful chocolate coating and a center full of creamy peanut butter. Except these candies were much bigger and even came in a limited edition chocolate and strawberry filling in 1980. At the time, Willy Wonka products were produced by Quaker Oats Company, under the Willy Wonka Candy Company. Nestlé acquired the Willy Wonka Candy Company in 1988, five years after Oompas' demise.

PB Max > Introduced: 1989 > Discontinued: 1994 > Maker: Mars Peanut butter and chocolate lovers alike were sad to see this product leave store shelves. PB Max stood out among other treats that married peanut butter with chocolate. The treat was made of a thick layer of peanut butter and oats atop of a whole grain cookie, which was covered in milk chocolate. The product fizzled out by the early '90s. Perhaps it was just ahead of its time? 24. Planters P.B. Crisps > Introduced: 1992 > Discontinued: 1994 > Maker: Planters Planters P.B. Crisps, while a cute idea, were not a huge success in the market. The corn-based shell of the P.B. Crisp resembled a peanut shell and was filled with peanut butter. Perhaps the product's more popular counterpart, the Nutter Butter, which already had a 20-year headstart, may explain why the peanut butter creation never took off with consumers.

Whistle Pops or Melody Pops > Introduced: 1975 > Discontinued: N/A > Maker: Spangler Candy Company; Chupa Chups Whistle Pops were all the rage in the late '70s up until the '90s. This candy was a lollipop and whistle all in one. The year the snack fell into obscurity is unidentifiable. However, we do know it was a hit among kids for at least two decades. 26. Swoops > Introduced: 2003 > Discontinued: 2006 > Maker: The Hershey Company Those who love chocolate would have likely enjoyed noshing on a good ole package of Swoops while they lasted. Swoops looked like chocolate-covered Pringles, but they actually didn't have any salty surprise in the middle -- or any kind of surprise -- they were simply chocolate slices. The chocolatey, scoopable chip came in various iconic Hershey flavors such as Reese's and Almond Joy. Bottom line is it wasn't profitable -- the product died out by the mid-2000s.

Well, the Reggie! Bar debuted at the Yankees home opener in 1978 and the confection survived for a total of four seasons. The round milk chocolate candy bar was filled with peanuts and caramel, much like the also popular Baby Ruth bar, which wasn't, in fact, named after baseball legend Babe Ruth. 28. Fruit-shaped Trix cereal > Introduced: 1991 > Discontinued: 2006 > Maker: General Mills Trix cereal had already been pleasing the masses since its inception in 1955, so when the fruit-shaped variety launched in 1991 fans were intrigued. Kids born in the late '80s and early '90s likely only remember the fruit-shaped Trix cereal. In 2006, General Mills decided to revert to the classic puffs of popped corn from its original launch. ALSO READ: 50 Best Cities for Singles 29. Munch 'Ems > Introduced: N/A > Discontinued: 2000s > Maker: Keebler Don't remember Munch 'Ems? Think of a hybrid between a potato chip and a cracker, and that basically sums up the concept of this salty snack. Munch 'Ems came in several flavors, including sour cream and onion, ranch, and cheddar. The product was off the shelves by the early 21st century. 30. Cookies 'N Cream Twix bars > Introduced: 1990 > Discontinued: 1991 > Maker: Mars The classic Twix bar has taken on a few different twists throughout the years, such as the Cookies 'N Cream version. This variety seemed to have resonated with the fans because it is widely missed. Surprisingly, the treat was only around for one year according to the Cookies 'N Cream Twix Facebook page made by fans. ALSO READ: The Weirdest Fact About Every American President 31. Fiery Habanero Doritos > Introduced: 2005 > Discontinued: 2009 > Maker: Frito-Lay Those who appreciate a spicy, cheesy chip likely salivated at the site of a Fiery Habanero Dorito. There have been petitions calling for the flavor's comeback. It's been absent from store shelves since 2009. 32. Apple Newtons > Introduced: N/A > Discontinued: N/A > Maker: Nabisco You probably guessed it. Apple Newtons were simply one of the various Fig Newton flavors. Nabisco changed Fig Newtons to just Newtons in 2012 because of the other flavors the company added, including raspberry and strawberry. However, it was the apple version that ended up getting the boot. Nabisco did come out with a baked apple & cinnamon flavor, but it's just not the same as the original apple.

Girl Scout Lemon Coolers > Introduced: Early 2000s > Discontinued: 2006 > Maker: ABC Smart Cookies and Little Brownie Bakers Who doesn't love a Girl Scout Cookie? Girl Scout's Lemon Coolers were short-lived, with the last boxes sold in 2006. The idea, however, didn't die. In 2012, the Girl Scouts released Savannah Smiles. Savannah Smiles are essentially the same refreshing, lemon-flavored cookie doused in soft powdered sugar, just with a different name and slightly different texture. 34. Ben & Jerry's Tennessee Mud flavor > Introduced: 1988 > Discontinued: 1989 > Maker: Ben & Jerry's Iconic ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's launched the Tennessee Mud flavor back in 1988. Like most Ben & Jerry's flavors, this title also wasn't transparent about the flavor's ingredients. Though, you expect any Ben & Jerry's to taste heavenly, even when it's called mud. Tennessee Mud had a coffee ice cream base with hints of amaretto, Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey, and roasted almonds swirled into the mix. Sadly, the flavor only lasted one year on the market.

Jell-O 1-2-3 > Introduced: 1969 > Discontinued: 1996 > Maker: Kraft Foods Jell-O products have been satisfying consumers for many decades, with the first attempt at the gelatin concoction whipped up as early as 1845. In 1969, the Jell-O 1-2-3 was born. It was a dessert of three separate layers, all with different textures. The bottom layer was a traditional jello base, the middle was similar to a mousse, and the top was creamy. Jell-O 1-2-3 came in five different flavors and was sold in stores until 1996. 36. Oreo O's > Introduced: 1998 > Discontinued: 2007 > Maker: Post and Kraft Foods Fans of the dunkable Oreo cookie were so pleased with the cereal form of this product that Post brought it back after it was discontinued in 2007. Oreo O's were discontinued after Kraft Foods, which owns Oreo, split from Post and took the rights to the recipe with it. Oreo O's returned to the market in June 2017 due to popular demand, but they were sold exclusively at Walmart for three months. This year, you can find Oreo O's in many supermarkets, including Target, Kroger, Meijer, and Giant Eagle.

Released during the mid-1990s, 3D Doritos were red-hot among kids and adolescents. Frito-Lay produced three different flavors of the special chip, including jalapeño cheddar, nacho cheese, and zesty ranch. 3D Doritos lasted for a few years, but were discontinued sometime in the early 2000s. Doritos Jacked 3D was considered the reboot of the product, launching in 2015, but it wasn't successful. You can no longer purchase either of the snacks. 38. Dunkaroos > Introduced: 1988 > Discontinued: 2012 > Maker: General Mills These packets of graham cookies with an icing pairing were a huge seller among kids for over two decades. Betty Crocker's Dunkaroos offered several different kinds of cookies and icing duos. One such combo was chocolate chip graham cookies with rainbow sprinkle icing.

Reese's Bites > Introduced: N/A > Discontinued: 2008 > Maker: The Hershey Company Like Butterfinger BB's, Reese's Bites were the other go-to movie theater treat. These bite-sized, chocolate-covered peanut butter balls were pure bliss, and because they were so small it was very easy to devour the whole bag. However, they had twice as many calories as package of two Reese's Cups. One small bag of the Reese's Bites To Go bag had 410 calories and 14 grams of saturated fat. The product fizzled out of stores nationwide by 2008. 40. Wonder Ball > Introduced: Mid-1990s > Discontinued: 2007 > Maker: Nestlé, Frankford Company Last but certainly not least, the Wonder Ball has been launched three times and discontinued twice. Originally called the Nestlé Magic Ball, the product launched in the mid-1990s and was discontinued by 1997 due to parents' concern that the inedible prizes inside the balls presented a choking hazard. The second version of the candy came in 2000, when Nestlé brought the product back, renaming it Wonder Ball, and filling it with hard candy as opposed to prizes. Frankford Company, which bought ownership of the product in 2004, discontinued it in 2007 but launched a "Despicable Me" themed Wonder Ball in 2016. By 2017, the company launched other themed Wonder Balls which are available for purchase at select retailers. ALSO READ: 75 Best Comedies of the 1980s
BBV894B	finance	finance-retirement	10 common ways seniors get scammed	Here's what to watch for to make sure you don't fall prey to some of the biggest rip-offs targeting seniors.	It's a sad fact that scammers often target the people with the most to lose, and the least chance to catch on or fix things. Seniors may have strong credit and a large nest egg for scam artists to go after. They also may be more trusting or less likely to report scams if they fear friends and family will think they can't manage their own affairs anymore. "People who grew up in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s were generally raised to be polite and trusting," says the FBI . "Con artists exploit these traits, knowing that it is difficult or impossible for these individuals to say 'no' or just hang up the telephone." Criminals defraud or steal an estimated $3 billion from seniors every year, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Here are some major, ongoing scams to watch out for: It's not the usual blah, blah, blah. Click here to sign up for our free newsletter. 1. Counterfeit drug scams Seniors often turn to the internet to find drugs that are more affordable, especially with specialized medications, says the National Council on Aging . As a result, they are commonly scammed online. Fake drugs masquerading as legitimate medicines may worsen your health conditions, the FBI warns . These drugs may look real but may be contaminated, expired or otherwise unsafe, the FDA says . For legitimate deals online, seek pharmacies that require a valid prescription from a doctor or another licensed health-care professional, are licensed by your state pharmacy board, and have a U.S. state-licensed pharmacist available to answer questions, the FDA says. Rogue sites may display a Canadian flag while being operated by criminals elsewhere. Another risk: Fake online pharmacies may misuse any personal information you provide, infect your computer with viruses or sell your personal information to other rogue operators. 2. Telemarketing scams You don't have to be a senior to fall prey to a voice on the phone urging you to "act now or miss out on a great deal." Still, many seniors do become victims. Seniors as a group make twice as many purchases over the phone as the national average, says the National Council on Aging. If you hear a caller say these things or make similar claims, the FBI says to just say, "No, thank you," and hang up: You've won a "free" gift, vacation, or prize but must pay "postage and handling" or other charges. You must send money, give a credit card or bank account number, or have a check picked up by courier before you can review the offer carefully. The caller resists providing references or letting you review the offer with your family, lawyer, accountant, Better Business Bureau or consumer protection agency. You can wait and consider an offer. And, pay only after services are delivered   never pay in advance. The Council on Aging warns of these other scams: Con artists who say they found money and will split it with you if you drop off a good-faith payment (often by withdrawing funds from your bank account). Solicitors claiming to raise money for charity (especially after a natural disaster). A tip: Ask what percentage of the money raised goes to commissions and how much goes to the charity. Related: 7 Ways to Stop Robocalls in Their Tracks 3. Anti-aging product scams Some scams take advantage of seniors who may feel the need to conceal their age at work and in social circles, the Council on Aging says. Many seek treatments and medications to maintain a youthful appearance. Whether they offer fake Botox or bogus homeopathic remedies, scammers profit in the anti-aging business, the council says. Renegade labs creating versions of Botox may work with the root ingredient, botulism neurotoxin, one of the most toxic substances known to science, the council says. A bad batch can have serious health consequences. Counterfeit "anti-aging" products may contain arsenic, beryllium, and cadmium   all known carcinogens   along with high levels of aluminum and dangerous levels of bacteria, the FBI warns . Products may cause eye infections, acne, rashes and psoriasis. Ask lots of questions about any offer of products, the bureau advises. Be dubious of "secret formulas," "breakthroughs," celebrity endorsements, or item can purportedly can cure a wide variety of unrelated conditions. 4. Funeral and cemetery scams Seniors may encounter scammers even at funeral homes and memorial services, says the National Council on Aging. Some crooks read obituaries to find and approach grieving widows or widowers at funeral services. Claiming the deceased owes them money, scammers try to extort money to settle the fake debts. Also, disreputable funeral homes may rely on seniors' unfamiliarity with the cost of funeral services, adding charges to the bill and insisting on an expensive casket, even for a direct cremation that can be done with an inexpensive cardboard casket. Since consumer protections vary from state to state, the FBI warns , unscrupulous operators sometimes try getting away with overcharging for expenses and even listing themselves as financial beneficiaries. Take along a trusted friend when visiting a funeral home. Make sure you understand what basic fees cover and what services are additional. Shop around. Don't feel pressured to buy, sign a contract or commit. 5. Real estate scams Scammers like to target elderly homeowners, the aging council says. In one scam, San Diego fraudsters sent property owners personalized letters disguised as official County Assessor's Office business. They found the properties' assessed values in public records and offered the homeowners (for a price) to help get a property value reassessment to lower property taxes. Reverse mortgage borrowers are another favorite target of scammers. Con artists hawking home repair and remodeling or fraudulent investments urge seniors to apply for reverse mortgages in order to pay for the products and services they are selling. The FBI adds that scammers also may urge homeowners to obtain a reverse mortgage to buy a lower-cost home that is, in fact, a distressed property. You may encounter thieves in real estate, financial services or other financial companies. Hoping to get their hands on seniors' home equity, they "help" homeowners obtain a HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage), diverting some or all of the money to themselves. The FBI cautions to watch out for offers of free homes, home flips, help with refinancing, investments, foreclosure or refinancing "opportunities." These scammers prey on seniors at church, in "investment seminars" and on TV, radio, billboards and mailers particularly. One Los Angeles con man swindled $17 million from elderly homeowners already in financial straits. He had them sign "deeds" to protect their property or get equity from it, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California says . Actually, the documents pledged their homes as collateral for fake loans. The swindler used the fraudulent deeds to steal homes and money, leaving elderly victims penniless and even homeless. Homeowners who were financially stressed, some of whom spoke limited English, were vulnerable targets, the AG's office says. (Article contniues after video.) 6. Social Security scams Some 35,000 people reported losing a total of $10 million to Social Security phone scams in 2018, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). And remember, those are just the people who realized they had been defrauded and reported it to the federal government. A typical Social Security scam goes like this: You get a phone call that appears to be from the real phone number for the Social Security Administration (1-800-772-1213). A voice tells you that your Social Security number has been suspended because of suspicious or criminal activity. The voice asks you to confirm your Social Security number. The caller warns that your bank account will be seized, and suggests you move money onto gift cards and share the numbers and PINs for those. The call is not really from the SSA. Someone just made it appear as if the call were coming from the agency's number   a practice known as "spoofing." The caller probably won't know your Social Security number until you tell them. Your bank account isn't going to be seized, and your money is safer in the bank than on gift cards, in cash or wired to anywhere else. Know this: The Social Security Administration does not make calls to threaten taking your benefits or to suggest you move money. Never give your Social Security number, bank information or credit card number to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly. If you have doubts, go to SSA.gov . Click on "Contact Us" (bottom of the page) and contact the agency yourself. To report any scam, contact the FTC's Complaint Assistant website . 7. Medicare card scams Recently, the federal government replaced old Medicare cards and Medicare identification numbers. The new ones do not reflect seniors' Social Security numbers, as we explain in " What You Must Know About the New Medicare Card You Will Get Soon ." The change is to thwart scammers. Ironically, though, it gave scammers a new opportunity. In this scam, a purported "Medicare representative" calls to get you to "verify" your Medicare number   new or old   and to send you a new card, for a fee. As we explain in " How to Avoid Scams That Target Your New Medicare Card ," both old and new Medicare numbers can be used for identity theft. If you don't recognize a caller's number, don't pick up. If you are suspicious of a caller, just hang up. Don't reveal your new or old Medicare number to a caller. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the program, won't call you unsolicited, points out the Better Business Bureau . If the agency needs to contact you, it will send a letter. And the new Medicare cards are free. 8. Vacation rental scams This scam is another one the FTC has been warning about in recent years: imitation vacation rental listings. Scammers might steal actual listings and simply change the contact information, assuming the identity of the real lister. Or they might invent property listings of their own, then advertise unbelievably low rates and try to convince travelers they've found a hidden deal. Be suspicious of listings well below the going rate, and always look up the address on a map   preferably a map with a street view of the property that you can compare with any listing photos. Don't let anyone rush you into paying, or convince you to use a payment method with inadequate protections, such as a gift card or wire transfer. And stick to well-known, reputable vacation rental websites like Homestay and Vrbo . 9. Computer security scams While anybody can fall victim to this type of scam, the FTC has warned of organized tech support scams targeting seniors in recent years. A typical scenario involves a telemarketing call from someone claiming to be from an established technology company   usually a household name, even if they're not necessarily known for computer security specifically. The caller will warn that hackers are likely to break into your computer and rob your bank account, and the caller offers a victim the sale and installation of security software. Once a victim agrees, the caller will give instructions that allow the scammer to remotely connect to the victim's computer, supposedly to install that security software. But while the scammer is doing that, they help themselves to personal information. They may even create new "security threats" on your computer so they can call back later and offer to "fix" them for an additional fee. The advice here is to ignore unsolicited offers to help beef up your computer security, especially if they involve letting someone remotely access your computer. If you aren't confident that your computer is safe, find a reputable service company where you can get face-to-face assistance and ask questions about what software you should install and safety procedures you should follow. 10. Grandparent scams The FTC reported a "striking increase" in the typical amount of money lost to this type of scam in 2018. People age 70 or older who were conned into sending cash reported losing an average of $9,000 per person. This type of scam usually starts with a phone call from someone pretending to be a grandchild of the victim who is in need of cash due to legal trouble. The caller might offer an embarrassing sob story about being caught drinking while driving   literally sobbing, to draw attention away from the unrecognized voice of a stranger. Then the caller pleads for help and asks the victim not to tell anyone, and to send cash in a particular way. The scammer might cull information about the victim's actual grandkids from social media, or wait for the confused victim to give a cue as to whom they should be impersonating. So, one of the best strategies here is to carefully guard your privacy, leaving it to callers to identify themselves. Don't say things like, "Is that you, Joey?" Limit access to your social media profiles to actual friends and family, and don't accept unexpected friend requests. That includes ones from people you know, because scammers often impersonate others' names and photos to gain access to your social media profiles. Verify that an actual friend or relative sent the request, such as by calling the person to confirm. If you get a call and are uncertain about the caller's authenticity, you can simply offer to "see what you can do" and end the call. Then, try to contact the alleged victim directly to see if it was a legitimate call. Brandon Ballenger contributed to this post.
BBLHZ7H	health	fitness	The 13 Best Road Bikes of 2020 (So Far)	Go fast, go long, go comfortably on these amazing bikes	In the past year, we've ridden and evaluated more than 100 of the top road bikes everything from budget picks, to fully customized carbon superbikes. We found inspiring road bikes for less $1,000, and excellent disc-brake equipped bikes for about $1,500, which was unheard of just a few years ago. We also discovered that some of the best road bikes ever built are in shops right now. Check out five of our top picks below or scroll deeper for longer reviews of these bikes and other high-ranking options, plus buying advice. What Do You Mean By "Road Bike?" Any bike on a road is a road bike, but this roundup will focus on light and swift drop bar, pavement oriented (but not pavement specific), bikes. They might be classified as road racing bikes or endurance bikes, but they're intended for the traditional road riding experience: smoother roads and higher speeds with a premium put on low weight, high stiffness, and vertical compliance. This style of bike usually forgoes versatility-enhancing details like rack and fender mounts, but will often have the latest performance oriented-features and technologies like aerodynamic tube shaping to cut through the wind, and integrated bar, stem, and seatpost for weight, stiffness, aerodynamics, and aesthetics. One of the most recent trends to hit this category is disc brakes, which not only has made stopping more confidence inspiring in all conditions, it has also improved tire clearance on most models so riders can enjoy the benefits more comfort, more traction, and in many situations, improved rolling efficiency of wider, lower pressure tires. Disc Brakes What began with a trickle about five years ago is now a full-on flood: disc brakes. More and more we're seeing race-oriented road bikes launching as disc brake only platforms (the new Wilier Zero SLR is one example). And just try to find a new endurance style road bike that doesn't have disc brakes. We're now far enough into the trend that the woes that saddled first-generation disc-brake road bikes additional weight, a harsher ride, aerodynamic penalties, noise have been evolved out of existence. That means that, for the most part, all you get are the benefits of disc brakes better control, more consistent performance, better performance in adverse conditions, fewer brake-heat induced rim, tube, and tire problems and with no drawbacks. And that's before we cover another huge benefit of disc brakes… Tire Clearance Rim brakes were a significant pinch point and limited most modern road bikes to tires of about 28mm wide or less. That's because most modern road bikes did not use medium or long reach brakes , but used a lighter and stiffer short-reach brake. By using disc brakes, that pinch point is removed, and we're seeing tire clearance of more than 32mm on even the most race oriented road bikes like the Specialized Venge, with many disc brake road bikes able to fit tires of more than 35mm. Wide tires offer more comfort, better traction, and roll faster than narrower tires in some situations. They're even safer in some cases: Imagine not darting around every little pothole and patch of gravel, but simply rolling over them. That's what big tires can do. Aerodynamics It's rare that a piece of modern road equipment doesn't at least have some aerodynamic tuning. The rider  and their riding position will always be the biggest source of aerodynamic drag, but modern materials and computer-aided design have allowed designers to add free speed in the form of improved aerodynamics with few drawbacks. But there are some road bikes designed to be as aerodynamic as possible. Bikes like the Specialized Venge, Trek Madone, Felt AR , and Cannondale SystemSix are the product of thousands of hours of computer modeling and aerodynamic tuning both in a virtual environment and in a wind tunnel. The object is to squeeze every bit of free speed possible out of the bike while still maintaining the properties a good racing bike requires: high stiffness, low weight, and some thought given to rider comfort. Opposite the aero road bike is the stiffness-to-weight bike (AKA climbing bike). These bikes forgo heavy aerodynamic optimization in the search for a frame that is as light and stiff as possible. That doesn't mean they're designed with no regard for aerodynamics: the Specialized Tarmac, Canyon Ultimate CF SLX, and Cervelo R5 are all bikes optimized for killer stiffness to weight ratio, but all manage to sneak in small aerodynamic tweaks. Climbing bikes are usually the lightest, liveliest, and smoothest riding bikes, and they usually feel faster than an aero-road bike even though, in most situations, they're actually slower. Integration Whether it's aerodynamics, stiffness to weight, comfort, or just plain style, the integration of what were standardized, off-the-shelf, parts is noteworthy trend. Noteworthy because it can elevate the performance or aesthetics of the bike, but also can make swapping a stem, seatpost, or handlebar or finding some other small part for repair or replacement a giant pain in the butt. That bleeding-edge bike you're lusting after might be the pinnacle of performance now, but if you're the sort that keeps a bike for 10 years, you might want to consider a bike with less integration and fewer proprietary parts. Materials The most common materials used to make modern road bikes are carbon fiber composite and aluminum alloy (sometimes just called "alloy," which is confusing because the titaniums and steels used for bike frames are also alloys). If you prefer something less common, you will also find bikes made of steel, titanium, hardwood, bamboo, and magnesium. While all the materials have intrinsic qualities, any material can ride very well or very poorly, be very strong or very fragile, depending on how it is used. Don't buy into myths like "all carbon frames are weak" or "all aluminum frames ride harshly." You will find that almost all bikes over $2,000 will be made of carbon fiber composite. This material is exceptionally strong, stiff, light, and tunable. More than any other material, carbon allows frame engineers to micro tune areas of a frame with specific attributes. Carbon is also more shapeable with fewer drawbacks when dramatically shaped than any other material. Know Your Fit While a good fitter should be able to make almost any bike fit you, it's helpful to get a good professional fit before you invest in a new road bike. Knowing your fit details can help you and the salesperson narrow down the list of bikes to those that will fit you best. If you're lucky enough to be comfortable in a long and low position, race-oriented bikes will fit you well, and are typically designed to steer properly with more weight on the front wheel. If your fit is more upright, an endurance style bike with a longer headtube will allow the handlebars to be properly positioned without a skyscraper of spacers (which can be unsafe), and this style of bike is usually designed to handle properly with less weight (compared to a race bike) on the front wheel. Drivetrains Most road bikes we review have a crank with two chainrings (also called 2x), and 11 rear cogs (11-speeds). But there are other drivetrain configurations . Under $1,300 is when you start to see drivetrains begin to subtract rear cogs. The first step would be 2x10, and as you travel further down the price scale, you'll see 2x9, then 2x8. With fewer speeds, the jump between each is larger, which makes shifting more clunky, and creates more dramatic cadence changes. Most road bikes use Shimano's drivetrains. And for good reason: they're great and provide the best shifting available. Up at the higher end of the spectrum, you may find bikes with Campagnolo's latest two by 12-speed drivetrains . Besides the exotic nature of the parts offered by this legendary company, the 12-speed cassette tighten up the jumps between gears. SRAM has also jumped into the 12-speed game with its new Red eTap AXS group which is available on high end bikes now. SRAM's lower-priced Force eTap AXS 12-speed electronic group is a popular drivetrain on mid-priced bikes. . Another drivetrain you might find is called one by (written 1x). Popularized by SRAM , this drivetrain is more often found on gravel or cyclocross bikes, but there are a few road bikes that use a 1x drivetrain. This system does not use a front shifter or derailleur, and does have larger jumps between gears, but can offer the same total range as a 2x system. 1x's advantages are simplicity, chain security, and aerodynamics. How We Chose These Bikes Every bike on this list has been thoroughly evaluated and vetted by our team of test editors. We research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and engineers, and use our own experience riding these bikes to determine the best options. All of these bikes have been put through their paces by our staff and carefully chosen based on their value, quality of parts (most of which have been tested separately), user reviews, our positive experience with the brand, and overall aesthetics. These are the best road bikes we recommend for fast and fun rides. [Related: 10 Best Women's Road Bikes Right Now ] Ridden and Reviewed  BEST NEW RACE BIKE  Giant TCR Advanced SL 0 Giant's premier race bike gets a full redesign for model year 2021. The frame is 140 grams lighter which helps the top of the line model shown here alight our scale at just 14.5 pounds (size large) impressive for a bike with power meter, disc brakes, and 42mm-deep tubeless-ready wheels. And even though it weighs less, Giant added some aerodynamic tuning to reduce drag for greater efficiency. The new TCR embraces the trend toward wider tires with clearance for up to 32mm-wide rubber. The build reflects the price: SRAM Red eTap AXS with power meter, carbon bar and stem, and a Cadex (a Giant brand) wheelset with carbon rims and carbon spokes. On the road, this bike is very quick and handles extremely well. Read Review View Gallery  AFFORDABLE PERFORMANCE AND VERSATILITY  Triban RC 520 105 Disc Triban is a house brand of Decathlon, a France-based sporting goods chain. The RC 520 is a value-priced endurance bike with a slightly upright position, a longer wheelbase for stability, great tire clearance (up to 36mm), and provisions for attaching racks and fenders. This model has a smooth shifting Shimano 105 11-speed drivetrain with compact gearing (11-32 cassette with 50/34 chainrings). The disc brakes are TRP's HY/RD, which is a cable actuated hydraulic brake that offers impressive performance. Decathlon backs the frame, handlebar, and stem with a lifetime warranty. We found this bike is not only a great value, it's a great ride. This is a smooth and versatile bike that's well suited to both paved and mild dirt-road riding. Read Review View Gallery ―ONE OF THE LIGHTEST BIKES YOU CAN BUY― Canyon Ultimate CF EVO Disc 10.0 LTD The Evo is based on the existing Ultimate CF Disc , and shares the same mold, but uses a different blend of carbon fiber to cut weight; a medium frame is claimed to weigh just 641 grams. Canyon tops it off with a svelte build kit based around SRAM's Red eTap AXS groupset to create a bike that weighs in at a jaw-dropping 13 pounds in our size small test sample. Buyer beware: there is little compromise in the bike. Geometry is race-oriented and designed for a fit rider who likes quick handling ; ride quality doesn't quite match up to that of the best all-around race machines like the Specialized Tarmac ; and the narrow focus on light weight means some of the parts picks are finicky and unforgiving. But if you want to hammer, especially on hills, the bike just…works. If you can afford it and can put up with its fussiness, it's a devastatingly effective hill-climbing machine that does not beg to be ridden fast; it demands it. READ FULL REVIEW ―WICKED FAST― Pinarello Dogma F12 The Dogma F12 puts on no pretenses; one look at it and you know that Pinarello designed the bike to be fast, smooth, and balanced. The unbelievably skinny frame, aero wheels, and aggressive geometry made jaws drop all over our office. The brand's fastest, lightest, and stiffest frame yet, the F12 has better lateral stiffness at the bottom bracket than its predecessor, the F10. This is thanks to an advance in technology from its carbon manufacturer that allows Pinarello to use less material while still achieving the same strength. The raw, unpainted F12 frame weighs a claimed 840 grams that's 1.8 pounds. Pinarello also beefed up a few areas of the frame while allowed for more flexion in others by making them thinner to make the power transfer as efficient as possible. This is one freaky fast bike, which it better be given the price tag. READ FULL REVIEW VIEW 48 IMAGES ―MOST REFINED ROAD BIKE― Specialized Tarmac Disc Pro The Tarmac Disc Pro delivers the same highly refined ride characteristics of the $11,000 S-Works Tarmac, but at a much more affordable price ($6,700 is still 6.7 times what I paid for my first car, but that rust bucket bore no resemblance whatsoever to anything that could be mistaken for a high-performance vehicle). The Tarmac Disc Pro, however, is every bit a high-performance bike. It's stiff but not overly harsh, tracks beautifully through hard turns without feeling twitchy, aero enough for Peter Sagan to win Grand Tour stages, and light enough to take into the mountains. It doesn't have the same level of vertical compliance that some high-end carbon bikes offer, but it has just enough to take the edge off. Instead of a silky-smooth ride, you experience enough of the road that you feel very in tune to what's happening below your wheels. The Tarmac Disc Pro offers up one of the most refined riding experiences you'll find anywhere stiff but not harsh, agile but not twitchy, and aero without being heavy.

It doesn't have disc brakes, but that likely saves some weight. And besides the Shimano direct-mount calipers are very good. Its performance is superb very stiff in the right ways and surprisingly complaint, with light and sharp steering. READ FULL REVIEW  BEST CLIMBING BIKE  Wilier Zero SLR Wilier-Triestina's Zero SLR is extremely light, and devastatingly fast. It's a shining example of how great a modern high end road racing bike can be. Designed for disc brakes and electronic-shift drivetrain only, the ZSLR has a claimed 780-gram frame that features aerodynamic tuning and a layer of liquid crystal polymer in the carbon to improve toughness and damp vibrations. The ride is glassy smooth, with all the stiffness you'd want for efficient climbing, with velvety handling that's a little less hyperactive than the typical race bike. READ FULL REVIEW VIEW 28 IMAGES  BEST ALL-AROUND ROAD BIKE  Trek Domane SLR 7 Trek's new Domane SLR is one of the best road bikes you can buy. It's a perfect blend of performance, practicality, and versatility like we've never experienced. It's crisp, slippery, and sharp handling like a road racing bike. But with Trek's decouplers which greatly increase vertical compliance compared to a rigid frame front and rear, the ride is practically plush, soaking up bumps big and small without (and this is important) killing the bike's feedback. Hidden storage in the downtube lets you carry tools and a flat kit and more without hanging junky-looking bags all over the sleek frame. Plus it has massive tire clearance up to 38mm and hidden fender mounts. READ FULL REVIEW VIEW 23 IMAGES  BEST VALUE DISC-ROAD BIKE  Jamis Ventura Comp This Ventura is one of the most impressive bikes we've ever tested. It offers a refined ride that's crisp and smooth, a smooth shifting drivetrain, sure-stopping disc brakes, full-carbon fork, and a butted aluminum frame for about $1,000. Its handling is well balanced which is partially the result of thought Jamis's product managers put into the geometry. The The Ventura's chainstay length, fork offset, and bottom bracket drop change across the bike's size range more detail than is found on many top of the line frames. READ FULL REVIEW VIEW 35 IMAGES  BEST VALUE ALL-ROAD BIKE  Kona Rove We love Kona's Rove bike line for the way they combine ruggedness, versatility and value. The $849 model that opens the line offers all those benefits at a sub-1000-dollar price. Highlights include powerful Hayes mechanical disc brakes, tough WTB Riddler Comp tires, and an attractive finish with nice graphic details. READ FULL REVIEW VIEW 33 IMAGES  BEST FOR NEW RIDERS  Giant Contend 3 Giant's entry-level road bikes have consistently amazed us with their performance and smooth ride. The newest generation Contend is a little sharper handling without losing its less aggressive riding position. And it still offers superb performance that far exceeds expectations. READ FULL REVIEW VIEW 31 IMAGES  BEST USA MADE CARBON  Allied Alfa Disc The Allied Alfa Disc offers a USA made carbon frame and fork, and customizable build and paint for less than you might expect. It's a stock-sized bike, but offered with a short or tall head tube to help you get the right fit. It's a subtle looking bike with rounded tubes and minimal graphics, and the ride is extremely balanced and neutral. READ FULL REVIEW  BEST DREAM BIKE  Colnago C64 The C64 is the only Colnago carbon frame made in Italy. The tube and lug construction with Colnago's signature Star shaping, claimed to provide more robust junctions recalls the brand's steel bikes of the past, but this race frame's performance is modern. The frame is light, very stiff, and offers excellent feedback, and a delicious, velvety, ride. The C64's steering is neutral, not hyperactive, and more tuned to long rides over varied terrain than point and shoot sprints. Two geometries are offered: one is a fairly standard race bike fit, the other is a high-stack option for riders needing a more upright position. READ FULL REVIEW

AAwTTtM	autos	autosenthusiasts	Ford EcoBlue; 2.0L Technical Wonder.	Moving Diesel Technology Forward	Major European cities such as Madrid and Paris are discriminating against diesel engines due to officials' concerns about the types of pollution oil-burners produce. Some municipalities have gone as far as making plans to eventually ban all diesel-powered vehicles from entering city limits. These concerns are making some diesel engine manufacturers reevaluate their future development. However, the scrutiny has not diminished Ford of Europe's diesel efforts, as evidenced by the release of its 2.0L EcoBlue powerplant. Research Ford on MSN Autos The four-cylinder EcoBlue is the most advanced diesel engine Ford has ever produced. Starting with a clean sheet, engineers focused on developing an engine that has very low internal friction. New technologies and ideas were combined to create an engine that provides improved performance, lower emissions, and better fuel efficiency in a compact, quiet, smooth-running package that is well suited for utility vehicles like the Ford Transit Connect van. Ford engineers designed a strong, lightweight block that provides reduced noise and vibration. An aluminum ladder frame bolted to the bottom to maximize strength and stiffness of the block helps reduce noise and vibration as well. Another key design feature is the 10mm offset crankshaft position. By offsetting the crank from the piston centerline, piston side load against the cylinder wall is reduced, thus decreasing friction and wear. The crank bearing diameters are also minimized to improve rotating efficiency. The EcoBlue diesel's cylinder head features a DOHC layout, with the camshafts mounted in a one-piece sealed module that bolts to the top of the head. The module's design reduces weight, friction, and size while helping increase manufacturing quality. The cams are driven by a belt-in-oil system that further reduces friction compared to traditional beltdriven setups. The head's intake system is engineered to equally balance the air between each cylinder. A process Ford calls "mirror-image porting" creates balanced airflow into the combustion chambers and multi-directional swirl in the cylinders (air swirls clockwise in Cylinders 1 and 2 and counterclockwise in Cylinders 3 and 4). This optimizes fuel burn, which improves consumption and increases torque while lowering emissions. Pressurized air is fed to the cylinders through a compact low-inertia variable-geometry turbocharger. The VGT optimizes air delivery at lower engine speed to maximize low-end torque. Innovations include the use of an aerodynamically advanced turbine wheel made of Inconel (an alloy used in extreme temperature environments like rocket engines) that has a 10-percent -maller diameter than previous designs and a 15-percent-smaller aerospace-grade-aluminum compressor wheel that reduces inertia and enables faster wheel speeds for quicker boost performance. The turbo is able to spin at speeds up to 240,000 rpm thanks in part to the use of low-friction bearings. A geardriven turbo actuator is used for faster response times. Fuel is delivered to the cylinders by a high-pressure direct-injection system that utilizes centralized eight-hole-nozzle piezo injectors in the cylinder head, which allow for precisely controlled fuel delivery up to six times per cycle. A 2,000-bar geardriven high-pressure fuel pump feeds the injectors. To meet the stringent Euro Stage 6 emissions standard, the EcoBlue uses a unique EGR system in which gases pass through a channel incorporated in the cylinder head, saving space and weight. The urea-injected SCR catalyst and particulate filter are mounted close to the engine to ensure a quick warm-up. In addition to the mechanical innovations developed to help reduce noise output, engineers also incorporated a multi-layered front cover that assists in damping sound coming from the belt drive and gears. Valvetrain racket is kept to a minimum by a high-frequency damping cover on top of the cylinder head.

Valuable vinyl Thinking of playing those old records? You might want to think again. Some original mint condition singles, EPs and LPs sell for huge sums these days, so a look through your vinyl collection could be music to your bank balance. Check out these 51 sought-after records and get searching. The Beach Boys   Ten Little Indians: up to $100 One to hold on to. Original pressings of this single (7", 45 RPM) are only worth around $100 now, but with the band firmly fixed as rock and roll legends these days, it's fair to say their early singles will be worth a great deal in years to come. Y Kant Tori Read   Y Kant Tori Read: up to $300 Singer-songwriter Tori Amos' failed rock debut is highly prized among fans of the piano-playing artist. The 1987 album, which has since been reissued, was panned by the critics and a limited number of LPs were pressed. Mint copies can fetch up to $300. Britney Spears   Britney: up to $400 Released in 2001, the limited edition of Britney's third album features a colored vinyl record, and came with a poster and cardboard inserts. A bona fide collector's item, the extra special LP is worth up to $400 in mint condition. Marilyn Manson   The Golden Age of Grotesque: up to $570 If you snapped up a vinyl copy of Marilyn Manson's fourth studio album during your teenage goth/alternative phase, you're in luck. The double 12-incher from 2003 is worth up to $570 in mint condition and even used copies can fetch several hundred dollars. Aretha Franklin   Take A Look: up to $750 Stereo versions of the Queen of Soul's 1967 album Take A Look are few and far between, and collectors have no qualms about paying hundreds of dollars to snag one. A mint condition specimen can achieve up to $750. Elvis   Elvis Presley: up to $1,000 Elvis records don't tend to sell for much, given that most teenagers in 1950s America bought them by the bucketload. However, certain records are worth a pretty penny. Have a look out for mono copies of the King's debut album. Copies can sell for up to $1,000. The Doors   Morrison Hotel: up to $1,100 First pressings of the Doors' fifth LP are worth good money, anything up to $1,100. They're not easy to identify, but look out for original copies on Elektra with light gold/tan labels rather than red or brown, as the latter were used on later pressings. Buddy Holly   That'll Be The Day: up to $1,500 The original 1958 pressing of Buddy Holly's That'll Be The Day album, released by Decca Records a year before the rock and roll pioneer was killed in a plane crash, will set you back $1,500 in mint condition, while used copies with slight imperfections go for around $1,000. Miles Davis   Kind of Blue: up to $1,500 Another one you can't retire on, but mint copies of Davis' Kind of Blue LP are worth up to a very respectable $1,500. You're looking for a 180 gram blue vinyl copy (not hard to spot) with a 6-eye label. Columbia switched to a 2-eye label in 1961, making the former versions more valuable. The Pagans   Six and Change: up to $1,600 An iconic American punk record, this cult 7" single by The Pagans was released on Neck Reckords in 1977. Only 200 are known to have been pressed, and mint copies are as rare as hen's teeth. Bobby Paunetto   El Sonido Moderno: up to $1,600 Jazz aficionados will pay through the nose for hard to find gems such as this Latin fusion album by vibraphonist Bobby Paunetto (whose surname is misspelled on the sleeve). An original pressing from 1965 is worth up to $1,600 in mint condition. Tom Petty   Wildflowers: up to $2,000 Tom Petty's solo work divides people more than Donald Trump. Unopened copies of this album with two original inner sleeves can fetch $2,000 while mint copies go for up to $700, which is not petty cash. Look out for that artwork and you could be in for a treat. The Cashmeres   Show Stopper: up to $2,000 During the 1960, mods in the north of England created a movement based around non-mainstream Motown-style music called Northern Soul. Collectors pay crazy sums of money for the most sought-after records, which include this 1965 dancefloor-filler by Washington DC's The Cashmeres. Samhain   Initium: up to $2,100 Deathrock band Samhain released a limited edition gray marbled version of their debut album Initium back in 1984. Only 40 copies were pressed, making this LP super-rare and valuable: collectors will pay up to $2,100 for a copy in reasonably good condition. Lee Morgan   City Lights: up to $2,100 Moneyed jazz enthusiasts wouldn't think twice about splashing up to $2,100 on this much-admired Blue Note classic by trumpeter Lee Morgan. Pristine first pressings of the 1957 LP are the most coveted and fetch the highest prices. J. R. Monterose   J. R. Monterose: up to $2,200 Another Blue Note rarity, the debut album of saxophonist J. R. Monterose is top of many a jazz record collector's wishlist. Original 1956 pressings are especially lucrative, realizing up to $2,200 at auction. Jess Hooper with The Daydreamers   All Messed Up: up to $2,500 Like classic jazz and northern soul, rockabilly is another genre that attracts die-hard fans and avid collectors. This early Memphis rockabilly 45 by Jess Hooper with The Daydreamers is worth up to $2,500 on account of its scarcity. Sun Ra   Jazz in Silhouette: up to $2,600 Initial pressings of this 1959 release from experimental jazz artist Sun Ra feature a silk-screen printed cover and are worth a small fortune. In 2016, a mint condition copy sold for just over $2,600. Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage: up to $2,700 US label Vee Jay Records released this compilation album in 1964 pairing The Beatles with yodeling easy listening star Frank Ifield. Only 100 copies of the cover that features the Fab Four were produced, making this particular version of the LP one of the rarest Beatles albums. Mötley Crüe   Too Fast For Love: up to $2,700 The first batch of Mötley Crüe's debut studio album was restricted to a limited edition of 900 when it was released in November 1981. These copies, which feature cover typography in black and white rather than red, are worth up to $2,700 apiece. The Queers   Kicked Out of the Webelos: up to $2,800 Only 200 copies of this 7" EP by punk band The Queers were ever produced, and when a copy of the 1984 recording does come up for auction, collectors fall over themselves to bid for it. They can expect to shell out up to $2,800. Lou Pride   It's a Man's World: up to $2,800 This 1972 cover by Lou Pride of the James Brown classic It's a Man's World is a Northern Soul favorite. Only 500 copies are known to have been produced, and surviving examples are like gold dust, fetching up to $2,800 apiece. Rhythm Cadets   Rockin Jimmy: up to $3,000 A mere 100 copies of this doo-wop 45 from 1956 by Syracuse band Rhythm Cadets were pressed, and mint specimens are almost impossible to come by these days. Collectors will part with up to $3,000 to get hold of one. George Lemons   Fascinating Girl: up to $3,000 Back to Northern Soul, this obscure 1960s R&B single by Detroit's George Lemons, who was sentenced in 1987 to life without parole for triple murder and died in prison in 1996, is highly prized among collectors. Mint copies sell for up to $3,000. Curtis Fuller   The Opener: up to $3,100 Enough to make the typical jazz cat go weak at the knees, mint, minimally scratched copies of this Blue Note LP by legendary trombonist Curtis Fuller are exceedingly valuable. Original mono pressings from 1957 are worth up to $3,100. Helene Smith   Sings Sweet Soul!: up to $3,100 This classic soul album from 1967 is highly sought out by collectors. Fewer than 500 copies of Floridian Helene Smith's LP were pressed, and even fewer are thought to exist these days, bumping up the value no end. Johnny Burnette and the Rock 'n Roll Trio: up to $3,100 The debut album of rockabilly band the Rock 'n Roll Trio, this 1956 LP had a big influence on the development of the genre. Exceptionally rare, copies of the first pressing realize prices up to $3,100. Nirvana   Bleach: up to $3,200 A copy of Nirvana's 1989 studio debut won't pay off your mortgage, and most vinyl editions won't even cover your cable subscription, but various re-releases are worth a great deal. Look out for the red and white marbled edition, which is worth up to $3,200 in mint condition. Other reissues are also valuable, but this is the pick of the bunch. The Rising Storm   Calm Before: up to $3,200 Widely regarded as one of the best and rarest garage band albums, Calm Before by the Rising Storm enjoys almost mythical status among vinyl collectors. Mint copies of the 1967 LP go for up to $3,200 at auction. Robert Tanner   Sweet Memories: up to $3,400 Released on obscure Virginia label Megatone back in 1970, this catchy single is considered one of the most desirable Northern Soul records. Very few were ever pressed and mint condition copies are worth up to $3,400. Nirvana   Love Buzz: up to $3,500 Before Nirvana got famous, the grunge band released this 1988 7" single on Sup Pop Records. Given only 500 were pressed, the track is revered by dedicated fans who will pay up to $3,500 to add it to their collection. Amos Milburn   Rockin The Boogie: up to $3,500 An album for serious collectors only, Amos Milburn's Rockin The Boogie is one of the rarest blues and R&B records in existence. An original copy of the 1955 LP pressed on red vinyl is worth up to $3,500. Del Shannon   Runaway with... : up to $3,700 Stereo copies of this 1961 album by rock and roll artist Del Shannon are extremely thin on the ground   only 80 are thought to have been pressed. This of course makes the LP hugely desirable, and mint condition copies sell for up to $3,700. The Del Tours   Sweet and Lovely: up to $4,000 Yet another Northern Soul rarity worth big bucks, this uptempo toe-tapper by The Del Tours was released by Starville Records in 1968. Only a handful of copies of the single are known to exist, each of which is worth up to $4,000. Elvis Presley   Can't Help Falling in Love: up to $4,000 Elvis' 1961 classic Can't Help Falling in Love sold over a million copies in the US, and the standard 45 rpm singles are ten a penny. The limited edition 33 rpm singles on the other hand are worth a fortune. The hula cover version is most valuable, realizing up to $4,000 at auction. The Four Voices   Your Love is Getting Stronger: up to $4,400 A record with almost legendary status among Northern Soul vinyl collectors, Your Love is Getting Stronger by Four Voices is as valuable as it is revered. Limited edition copies of the 1977 single with green labeling are most valuable, fetching up to $4,400. The Velvet Underground   The Velvet Underground & Nico: up to $4,500 This 1967 classic featuring cover art by Andy Warhol bombed upon release, and only 30,000 copies were pressed. Nowadays, rare first pressings are mega-valuable. Look for a copy with a peelable banana sticker covering Eric Emerson's torso. An unpeeled example sold for $4,500 in 2016. John Coltrane   Blue Train: up to $4,700 The last word in classic jazz LPs, John Coltrane's Blue Train album is ridiculously collectible.

Frank Frost with the Night Hawks   Hey Boss Man: up to $5,000 This album by renowned Delta blues harmonica player Frank Frost is ultra-rare.

Robert Johnson   Sweet Home Chicago: up to $6,000 The most wanted pre-war Blues record in vinyl collectordom, Sweet Home Chicago by Robert Johnson is exactly the sort of thing you wish you could discover in your grandpa's dust-covered collection.

If you have a precious pink copy, it could be worth up to $6,000. Judge   Chung King Can Suck It: up to $6,100 Just 110 copies of this 1989 album by hardcore punk band Judge were ever produced, and when mint condition copies come up for sale, they tend to go for thousands of dollars. The Sloths   Makin' Love: up to $6,700 A very small number of copies exist of this classic single by west coast garage rock band The Sloths, and only one has come on to the market in recent years. As a result, the LP is worth up to a whopping $6,700. Roland Kirk   Triple Threat: up to $6,900 One of the rarest jazz LPs, a very small number of copies of Roland Kirk's 1956 album on King Records were ever pressed. The sole surviving mono mint copy went under the hammer for $6,900 in 2015. Rammellzee and K-Rob   Beat Bop: up to $8,000 The holy grail of rap records, this early hip-hop single from 1983 influenced everyone from the Beastie Boys to De La Soul, and features cover art by Jean-Michel Basquiat, adding to its cachet. Restricted to a limited release of 500, mint examples are worth up to $8,000 these days. Hank Mobley   Hank Mobley: up to $10,250 Like the other Blue Note classics featured in this round-up, Hank Mobley's eponymous 1957 album is tremendously valuable. Only several hundred copies were printed, some of which feature an error on the label. Mint copies are worth up to $10,250, and possibly more with the label error. Stonewall   Stonewall: up to $14,000 A slew of record companies were set up in the 1970s and early 1980s with the sole purpose of producing music that would lose money in order to offset tax. The so-called tax scam records are highly collectible, and the most valuable, Stonewall by Stonewall from 1976, is worth up to $14,000. Elvis Presley   That's All Right: up to $15,000 The first ever Elvis single, That's All Right was released in July 1954 and popular music was never the same again. Mint condition copies sell for thousands of dollars, but the most valuable feature a misprinted upside-side '207' on the B-side. These sell for up to $15,000. Bob Dylan   The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan: up to $35,000 As one of Dylan's most lauded records, most copies of this are not worth a huge amount. However, certain editions that feature four additional tracks are insanely valuable. Original stereo copies are worth up to an incredible $35,000, and mono copies sell for up to $15,000 in mint condition. The Beatles   Yesterday and Today: up to $125,000 One of the most infamous album covers in music history, this 1966 US compilation originally had a photo of the Fab Four wearing butchers' smocks and draped in decapitated dolls and meat on its front. It was pulled from those stores that had allowed it to be sold after a day and replaced with a much more anodyne photo of the band. So-called 'first state' versions with the original image are hugely valuable and very rare. A sealed copy sold for $125,000 via Heritage Auctions in 2016. 'Second state' pressings with the replacement cover pasted over the original are also very valuable (look for 'File Under: The Beatles' and 'T2553' in the top right corner of the front cover). Once news broke of the switch, many enterprising fans peeled off the replacement cover, with varying degrees of success. These are known as 'third state' copies and are less valuable.

I'm not trying to make the most epic humblebrag ever, but if you're willing to listen I'll share a secret few automotive writers are willing to admit: car journalism can spoil you for simplicity. While I live for the thrill of driving dirty in the freshest Huracan Performantes, V8 Vantages, and 911 GT2 RSs, constant exposure to those increasingly astronomic levels of performance invariably begs the question: are we losing appreciation for the slower, simpler ancestors that propelled us into this golden age of horsepower? Or, put another way: does eating steak everyday make you crave a simple bowl of rice? With those thoughts lingering in my transom a few years ago, I began the process of shopping for a personal car that could keep me in touch with the fundamentals of performance and soul two forces that don't always occupy the same vehicle at the same time. I've always had a thing for air-cooled 911s, my last being a 1983 SC, a relatively crude but wonderfully over engineered piece of equipment whose whirring flat-six was robust enough to outlast the cockroaches. This time around, however, I was craving what many consider the ultimate air-cooled 911: the wide-hipped 993 series, the most refined, final generation of the three decades-long, radiator-free cars. My first 993 test drive, however, revealed something I wasn't expecting from an air-cooled era 911 an overwhelming sense of refinement. The engine was relatively quiet and the suspension, while responsive, was mostly cushy, making its personality seem better suited for long distance road trips, not razor's edge canyon carving. I still dug the 993's fluid lines (and those hips, oh those hips) but I missed the SC's edgier, involving rawness. At the end of the day I decided to take the plunge on a bone stock 1997 Carrera coupe and make a series of minimally invasive modifications to wake up its driving dynamics. I've usually been a stickler for keeping cars stock, so I took this project on with a bit of care, choosing to infuse my new baby with personality via reversible, bolt-on steps. First up were the wheels. Though my 911 came with genuine Porsche Turbo Twist hoops, they weren't the lightweight, hollow-spoke types. After investigating aftermarket solutions, I settled on HRE. The Vista, California-based company has been custom fabricating wheels for four decades, and they brought that expertise to my car by starting off with a home visit involving removing the existing wheels to make 3D laser scans of the front and rear wheel wells. By measuring the suspension and body's dimensions and clearances, an optimum width and offset measurement was created, and a set of 18-inch HRE R101s were CNC milled from a raw slug of forged billet aluminum. The bronze anodized wheels, though aesthetically quite different from stock, set off the 993's forest green metallic paint and clean lines nicely. They also filled the wheel wells perfectly, offering a stance that made the car look fast and poised, even at a standstill. I chose to wrap the HREs in the latest Pirelli P-Zero rubber, sporty summer street tires equipped with Formula 1-derived features like a rigid compound in the bead for sharper steering response exactly what I was looking for out of the Porsche. Unfortunately Pirelli's Porsche-specific N spec tires weren't available at the time, but the standard P-Zeros were kindly installed at Pirelli's P Zero World facility in Los Angeles, where my 911 shared service bay space with curiosities like Phantom Drophead Coupes rolling on massive 22-inch rims and tricked out Range Rovers. Ah, L.A. Next on the agenda was addressing the mushy ride, which was solved by ditching the tired old shocks in favor of a set of Bilstein B12 Prolines, which come bundled with Eibach coils. Though not fully adjustable like the popular, track-oriented PSS10 models, B12s do offer up to 40mm of ride height adjustability, which enabled my car to more closely resemble a Euro-spec setting. Huntington Beach, California-based BBi Autosport handled the suspension work; coilovers were installed, the old control arms with worn bushings were replaced with OEM Porsche units, and Tarrett Engineering drop links were added to the rear. The final mechanical goal was to pull more character from the exhaust note, which led me to Borla Performance Industries in Oxnard, California. Though company founder Alex Borla has strong roots to the Zuffenhausen manufacturer, including an early career stint as a factory Porsche test driver, much of their 21st century work was been focused on American muscle. Wishing to develop an exhaust specifically for the 993, Borla reached out offering to use my car as a test bed for a new muffler system. With a background building exhausts for endurance races like the Baja 1000, where drivers loathe droning noises, it was easy to agree to the time commitment. After spending over a week with the car, they developed two options for me to choose from: one louder spec, and a more subtle but throaty variant. Back-to-back test-drives led me to the second, slightly quieter version. Last, but certainly not least on my to-do list was the task of updating the Porsche's antiquated stereo. Accustomed to the conveniences of modern automotive infotainment systems, I sought a piece of hardware that could incorporate as many features as reasonably possible without cluttering up the dashboard with visual noise. The solution was, again, easy: Porsche's Classic Navigation system, a DIN-sized head unit designed specifically for old school P-Cars. Though its knobs look like they belong in something ancient, the system features a 3.5-inch touchscreen with navigation and satellite-capable radio tuning. A remotely installed mic offers Bluetooth phone calls, and music can also be streamed through the system. Overall, these seemingly subtle changes had a transformative effect on the 911's personality. The relatively non-aggressive Bilstein B12s sharpened the handling without creating an abusively stiff ride, and the steering response was enhanced thanks to the fresh bushings on the new control arms. The Pirelli rubber, delivering far more reassuring turn-in and higher mid-level grip, also improves handling. Much of the ride compliance can also be attributed to the HRE wheels, which shaved approximately 9 pounds of weight per corner a massive reduction enabling far easier articulation over bumps. The Borla exhaust's added growl lends some much-needed character to the exhaust note, offering a staccato pop during off-throttle deceleration, and an aggressive howl when laying into the gas. Though the Classic Navigation system's screen is a tad small, the package manages to fit perfectly in the dashboard environment, while maintaining an OEM look. Also welcome is the functionality of hands-free calling and music streaming, making the 993 more livable during day-to-day driving. Net sum? When I let go of the idea of owning a one hundred percent stock car, the series of relatively painless modifications amplified the aspects of the 993's personality that make it more viscerally involving to drive, making it a charismatic cruiser and a more soulful dance partner on winding roads, all through changes that can (mostly) be easily reversed if the call of historical accuracy beckons.

BBLHWzM	health	fitness	12 Habits Every Runner Should Have in Their Routine for 2020	Follow these everyday tips for a fitter, healthier, and happier new you.	Runners dream big. Tackling a new distance , posting a personal best, losing 20 pounds  we embrace grand challenges throughout the year. But what happens after that goal is (hopefully) met? You risk losing motivation and stalling unless you've changed your routines to those of a stronger, healthier runner. "Runners who are consistent with good habits have the most success," says Tom Holland, an exercise physiologist, sports nutritionist, coach, and author of The Marathon Method . When it comes to making running resolutions (whether in January or later in the year when you're preparing for a race in the late summer or fall), consider goals based on process instead of outcome. That way, you can sustain momentum by celebrating small, frequent victories. And you'll avoid the all-or-nothing thinking that triggers massive disappointment if factors beyond your control interfere along the way for instance, if you wake up to a sweltering race day. The benefits of healthy habits spill over into a better life beyond running, too. Here are 12 healthy habits the most highly motivated runners develop, with expert advice on how to make them your own. Become a Morning Runner You meant to log those five miles today, but between family, work, and social obligations, it just didn't happen. Or you find your digestive system rebelling  or your sleep disrupted  courtesy of evening runs. The solution: Put running first on your agenda. [Build your personalized and adaptive training plan for FREE with Runcoach .] "People who start to run early in the morning get hooked on that feeling of having accomplished so much before others are even awake, as well as the extra energy they get from that morning rush of endorphins," says Lisa Reichmann, a Maryland-based running coach. Make It Routine Test the waters. Start with one or two days per week. Knowing you have the other five mornings to snooze makes getting up early less painful. And to stay motivated, make sure you can get to bed on time the night before a crack-of-dawn call, or you risk skimping on sleep, Reichmann says. Lay it out. Set out your clothes, shoes, water bottle , and reflective gear the night before to eliminate excuses and get out the door quickly. Set your coffeemaker on automatic so your brew is ready when you wake. And put your alarm across the room jumping out of bed to turn it off makes it harder to hit the snooze button, Reichmann says. Make a date. Nothing keeps you from going back to bed like knowing someone's waiting for you. "Good conversation with running friends almost makes you forget that you are running at zero dark thirty on a cold morning," says Julie Sapper, who coaches with Reichmann at Run Farther & Faster in Montgomery County, Maryland. Give it time. All habits feel awkward at first. Since it requires resetting your body clock, morning running may require a little longer than most at least three or four weeks to sink in. Consider trying this habit in the spring, when weather and darkness are less likely to interfere. And morning runs aren't right for everyone, so re-evaluate after a month or two, Sapper says. Strength Train Regularly Building muscle improves your health , reduces injury risk, and, according to a review in the journal Sports Medicine , improves your running performance which is always motivating. Across 26 studies of endurance athletes, strength-training programs (either plyometrics or heavy weights) boosted fitness, increased efficiency, and reduced runners' times in 3K and 5K races. Design your own program by picking six exercises : two for each of your major muscle groups (upper body, core, and lower body), with one working the front side (say, planks ) and one the back side (bridges), says Rebekah Mayer , national training manager at Minneapolis-based Life Time Run. Do them two or three days per week. If you do regular strength-training, leave rest days between hard efforts. Make It Routine Build it in. Runners that Reichmann and Sapper coach had an easier time staying motivated to incorporate strength moves when they penned them into their training plans. Now, their schedules might say: Run three miles, then do three sets of 15 one-legged squats, mountain climbers, planks, and pushups. For best results, strength-train later in the same day as your more intense or longer running workouts, allowing a full day of recovery in between hard sessions, Mayer says. [ Download the All Out Studio App for amazing Runner's World cross-training workouts!] Break it up. Try "exercise snacks" planks when you get up in the morning, pushups before you leave for work, lunges on coffee breaks. Take a class. Don't want to DIY? Choose a runner-friendly strengthening class that sounds fun, like Pilates , a barre class, or BodyPump. It might cost money, but spending can increase the odds you'll follow through, Holland says. Change it up. In about a month, your body will adjust to the routine. "Make it harder whether it means doing more repetitions, more weight, or different exercises or you'll stop seeing results," Mayer says. Cross-Train Regularly If you're struggling to squeeze three or four runs per week into your schedule, you shouldn't worry about adding in other aerobic activities. But once you have a steady running habit, workouts like swimming , cycling, or rowing can boost your fitness without the impact stress of running. And by engaging different muscle groups, you can correct muscle imbalances and net a stronger, more well-rounded body. "This can increase your longevity as a runner," Mayer says. If you do get hurt, you'll also have a familiar option for maintaining fitness. Make It Routine Stay consistent. Sticking to a regular class at the gym is an easy way to automate cross-training. Even if you go solo, set up a regular date and location, such as cycling in your neighborhood on Monday mornings context cues help habits to form. Be realistic. Don't set yourself up for failure by choosing a class you'll have to rush to attend. Search for an option that meshes with your schedule. Choose wisely. Gunning for a PR? Go with a type of cross-training that mimics running, such as cross-country skiing or pool running. If, however, your goal is overall fitness, select an activity that's very different, like swimming or cycling, Mayer says. Keep it easy. Treat cross-training like an aerobic recovery day; schedule it after hard running days and keep your effort level low enough to carry on a conversation, Mayer says. (However, if you're injured and can't run, you can cross-train harder.) And keep in mind that boot camp or fitness classes that involve treadmill running or road sprints don't count as cross-training that's a running workout. Eat More Vegetables Low-calorie and packed with nutrients, veggies should be a staple in every runner's diet. Their high-quality carbohydrates power your workouts, and their antioxidants help you recover. "Vegetables also keep you regular, and we all know runners don't need any 'surprises' while on a long run," says Conni Brownell, who serves as the Brooks Running Beastro Chef (cooking for employees at the shoe company). The benefits last long after your cooldown: Each daily serving of produce (up to five) reduces your risk of early death by about five percent, according to a new study. Make It Routine Indulge in your favorites. Don't choke down kale if you hate it. Pick up produce you actually want to eat, even if it's more costly or less of a "superfood." Add them to your menu. When you buy a new veggie, know when you'll consume it, says Jennifer Plotnek, lead behavior coach at weight-loss company Retrofit . Will you cook that spinach into your omelet, blend it into your postworkout smoothie, or make a big dinner salad? Start on the side. Dive into the veggies first to avoid filling up before you get to them, says sports nutritionist and exercise physiologist Felicia Stoler, D.C.N., R.D. No sides (or only French fries)? Ask to swap or add vegetable soup or a salad and eat it first you might consume fewer calories overall, according to Penn State University research . Snack smarter. Trade chips or candy for a produce/protein pair carrots and hummus or tuna on cucumber slices, for example to improve between-meals eats. Warm Up Before a Run; Stretch and Foam-roll After The repetitive motion of running tightens muscles, increasing your injury risk. Dynamic stretches before a run prep your body for more intense activities, says Gary Ditsch, exercise physiologist. Afterward, static stretching can return your muscles to their prerun length, even if you don't actually gain flexibility, Mayer says. And foam rolling  either immediately postrun or later in the day loosens tissue in ways that stretching alone can't. Ditsch advises a 10- to 15-minute warmup routine: Start with leg swings (first front to back, then side to side), then walk, march, and skip before you finally run. Postrun, stretch your hip flexors and hamstrings (which tighten during running and sitting), calves (to prevent Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis ), and your chest and shoulders. "We don't think about using our arms during our run, but they can also get very tight," Mayer says. Foam-roll any area that still feels tight, holding for a few seconds on tender points to help release them. Make It Routine Start small. Don't kick things off with a 30-minute full-body elongation session. Start with 10 to 15 seconds of a single stretch after a run, then celebrate the feeling of declaring victory each time you incorporate a habit strengthens it over time, Plotnek says. Pair it up . Create a bond between an activity you're doing daily anyway say, watching Netflix and foam rolling. Keep it in sight. Buy your own foam roller instead of relying on your gym or training buddy. Keep it in a visible spot near where you'll use it, and have a massage stick in your office, Sapper says. Factor in the time. If you have a 45-minute run on your training plan and exactly 45 minutes to do it, chances are you'll rush into it without the dynamic stretches. Adjust your schedule so you have a full hour for your workout, or consider decreasing the mileage to accommodate the warmup. Unplug on the Run Once a Week For data-obsessed runners, occasionally ditching the GPS reconnects you with your natural pacing and rhythms. "You'll learn what conversational pace feels like and what your breathing should sound like at different intensity levels," Mayer says. And while no one doubts the motivating power of music , removing your earbuds sometimes offers other advantages. For one, you'll stay safer in unfamiliar territory; plus, you'll notice and appreciate your surroundings more without auditory distractions, Mayer says. And if you're planning a race that forbids tunes, you'll line up prepared. Make It Routine Time it right. Easy runs , trail runs, and periods when you're coming back from an injury or recovering from a race are prime times to go gadget-free. "Without the pressure of seeing your pace, it can be easier to take it easy while you're ramping up again," Mayer says. Remind yourself. This habit is tricky because you're shifting your routine on just one day of the week. You lace up, slap on your watch, and grab your phone and you're out the door with all the gear you meant to leave behind. So choose a consistent day say, a tech-free Tuesday and set a recurring phone alert for before you head out, Plotnek says. Go by time. Measuring some runs by time instead of distance lets you at least downgrade from a GPS unit to an analog watch. If you feel the need to note your pace and mileage at the end, choose a go-to route you'll at least avoid continually checking your pace, Reichmann says. Reset your motivation . On gadget-free runs, focus on contemplation, prayer, or disconnecting from the stress of the day. You might experience your runs in a new way and embrace being unreachable, Plotnek says. Cook at Home More Often Extra calories, fat, sugar, and sodium lurk in restaurant dishes, so dining out adds extra pounds that weigh down your running performance and your health. One study in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health found that the more frequently you eat out, the higher your BMI is likely to be. Research suggests that carrying just two excess pounds can add 12.4 seconds to your 5K time and one minute, 45 seconds to your marathon finish. You don't have to transform into a top chef, but mastering kitchen basics has perks beyond weight control. "Preparing your own food teaches you what works for your fuel needs and what doesn't," says Brownell. "You're in control of the food choices and also the cost." Make It Routine Get a jumpstart. Sign up for a cooking class. Whole Foods offers courses at their stores. Clean up your kitchen. Ditch or stow gear you never use to clear real estate for daily tools like a chef's knife, a cutting board, a pot, and a grill pan, along with common ingredients like olive oil, salt, and pepper. Re-create your cravings. Have a restaurant fave? Google it you may find the recipe or something similar. Experiment at home to replicate the flavors while controlling the ingredients. Plan for flavor. Take 30 minutes to an hour each week to find recipes and go to the grocery store. Don't forget fresh herbs, which "keep meals interesting, and if you are interested, you are more likely to eat at home," Brownell says. Add a Weekly Long Run Efforts of an hour or longer build endurance, grow capillaries that carry nourishing blood to your muscles, strengthen bones and ligaments, and prepare you for races of any distance. Newer or low-mileage runners first need to focus on running regularly three or four times per week, then building up to an hour on one of those runs, says Ditsch. Designate one day a week as your long day , even if that means 20 minutes of run/walk instead of your usual 15. Then add 10 percent to your longest run per week, but never any more than a half-mile to two miles at a time, Ditsch says. Make It Routine Plan it out. Write out your long-run progression for the next month or two in advance, then sit down each Sunday night or Monday morning and plug your long run (and the others) into your schedule. Be flexible if you need to reserve weekends for family activities, try early Friday mornings for long runs. Turn in early. "If you're going longer on Saturday, Friday night should be a little more mellow. Eat and drink appropriately for what's coming up," says Mayer. Try a new scene. Drive to a nearby trail or forest preserve. Varying your surroundings will make the hours or miles pass more quickly. Find some buddies. A support system helps any new habit take root. But groups provide added benefits as the miles add up safety, distraction, and an opportunity to develop bonds. Get Enough Sleep Few habits have as much of an impact on your running and your health as getting sleep . "Everything is so much worse when you don't have enough sleep; it not only permeates your running, it affects your work life, your family, your relationships," Sapper says. While you snooze, your body and mind recharge, repairing the damage done from hard training, releasing human growth hormone to build muscles, and strengthening connections between nerves and muscles. Regularly shorting on shut-eye has been linked to everything from limits on your muscle glycogen storage to injury risk and moodiness, weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease. Most people need six to nine hours per night; if you regularly feel like you might nod off during meetings or if you conk out immediately when you hit the sack, you're probably not sleeping enough. Make It Routine Declare bedtime sacred. Start with a month-long commitment to add between a half-hour and an hour more to your regular sleeping time. Clear that block of time plus an hour beforehand to wind down. Ask your friends and family to nix late-night calls and texts, says Shelby Harris, Psy.D., director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at Montefiore Medical Center. Unplug. During that final hour, shut down all your screens, including phones, TVs, tablets, and computers. The blue light they emit dims production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Designate an old running-shoe box for electronics at the appointed time, plunk your devices inside and shut the lid until morning. Do something relaxing, like reading a book or completing a crossword, instead. Watch the caffeine. Rethink that late-afternoon latte. A caffeine jolt as long as six hours before bedtime can disrupt your slumber, decreasing the restfulness of your sleep without you even realizing it, according to a study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine . Choose sleep over miles. If you're an early morning runner but can't seem to hit the sack early the night before, cut your run a few miles short rather than setting your alarm earlier, Sapper says. (Interested in tracking your sleep? Try one of the smart devices below.) Apply Sunscreen Before Every Run Forget just treating sunburns  an estimated one in five Americans will develop skin cancer and with long hours on the roads or trails, runners face a particularly high risk. In fact, an Austrian study found distance runners had more irregular moles and other cancer risk factors than nonathletes. Ultraviolet light also causes wrinkles, brown spots, and other cosmetic damage, says marathoner and Boston dermatologist Robin Travers, M.D. Fortunately, sunscreen protects you from all these consequences, provided you use it properly. While visible sunlight dims on cloudy or winter days and at dawn or dusk, cancer-causing UVA rays still shine through--so unless your entire run will be completed with the aid of a headlamp, you need to slather up, she says. Make It Routine Go up an SPF. A sun protection factor of 15 does adequately protect you from skin cancer, but only if you use the recommended ounce to cover your body and most people, even dermatologists, don't, Travers says. "I can't tell you how often I've been on the Boston Marathon bus in the morning and I see people applying these teeny tiny dabs of sunscreen to their faces," she says. If you move up to 45 or higher, you're more likely to get the protection you need even if you skimp. Make it last. Most sunscreens contain active ingredients that, paradoxically, break down after two to three hours in ultraviolet light. Look for ingredients that say they're photo-stabilized, meaning they'll last four to five hours with one application. And make sure the bottle says "water resistant for 80 minutes" while recent labeling changes mean no sunscreen can claim to be sweatproof, these formulas resist moisture the longest, says American Academy of Dermatology spokesman Darrell Rigel, M.D. Stick it in your shoe. Store the sunscreen in your trainers, so you literally can't go for a run without noticing it, Travers says. Avoid the sting. If burning eyes are holding you back from sunscreenapplication, try Travers's trick: Apply sunscreen only from the eyes down, then protect your eyes with sunglasses and your forehead with a running cap. Eat Breakfast Every Day Your muscles can store only about six to seven hours' worth of glycogen for energy, so each morning you wake up depleted, says Stoler. A morning meal offers you a chance to replenish them and also sets thetone for the rest of your day. Studies of people who've lost weight and kept it off show 78 percent of them eat breakfast on a regular basis. Make It Routine Choose something over nothing. Your stomach may need to adjust to eating first thing. Even a piece of fruit can get you started, Plotnek says. Balance it out. Add on until you're eating a meal that's about 300 to 400 calories, featuring half produce, one-quarter whole grains, and one-quarter lean protein. If you eat it after your run, aim for a 4:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein to satisfy you and begin to repair the muscles you damaged during your workout. Expand your definition. You don't have to stick with traditional breakfast food if you're not a fan, says Stoler. Leftovers, sandwiches, salad  anything is fair game. Pregame it. Spend Sundays prepping a week's worth of breakfasts  dole out cooked oatmeal into single-serving containers or boil eggs. If you're a smoothie fan, clean, chop, and store the fresh ingredients when you get home from the store. Sit Less Even runners often spend an average of 10 hours and 45 minutes per day with their butts parked in chairs. As you rest, your hip flexors and hamstrings tighten and your posture slumps, boosting injury risk, Ditsch says. And the research on the health harms of sedentary behavior has grown so alarming that many experts call the problem "sitting disease." An exercise habit alone won't save you from consequences like weight gain and heart disease, but research also shows that standing or walking breaks can make a big difference. Make it Routine Track it. Log your sitting time or strap on an activity monitor. Manufacturers like Polar and Garmin now make models that double as GPS devices. Then consider this: Six to seven hours of total daily sitting time harms your fitness about as much as an hour of running helps it, according to a study in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Set mini-goals. Use that tracker to look beyond your total daily step count, which is skewed by your runs. Most devices tally the hours you spend sedentary; aim never to log more than two in a row where you're getting fewer than 1,000 steps. Remind yourself. Set two alarms on your phone, computer, or fitness tracker midmorning and two midafternoon to tell yourself to move. Demand to stand. If getting a standing desk isn't feasible, make rules for your workday: Rise each time someone comes into your office, pace on every call, hover in the back of the room during meetings. Anchor it to what you're already doing and you'll find it easier to remember, and over time, the first behavior will become a trigger for the new habit.

High blood sugar can wreak havoc on your heart, brain, and yep, even your sex life. 10 Unexpected Things That Happen to Your Body if Diabetes Goes Untreated When you hear " diabetes ," your mind likely jumps to problems with producing insulin and regulating blood sugar . And that's definitely a key part of this chronic disease, which affects nearly 1 in 10 Americans , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But that's also just the tip of the iceberg. "Diabetes is like termites, in that it causes slow, hidden, but significant damage in the body," says Osama Hamdy, M.D., Ph.D. , director of the Inpatient Diabetes Program at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. "Most patients with type 2 diabetes die from a heart attack ," Dr. Hamdy says, "but because the disease doesn't have many symptoms, people tend to take it lightly." And evidence continues to mount that diabetes affects every system in the body, wreaking havoc if it's not well managed. Learn more below about the side effects of diabetes and how you can protect yourself from complications. (The good news: Most can be avoided by following the treatment plan set out by your doctor.) 1) High blood pressure and cholesterol When you have type 2 diabetes, your body can't properly use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. In turn, your HDL (or "good") cholesterol lowers, and your levels of harmful blood fats called triglycerides rise. Insulin resistance also contributes to hardened, narrow arteries, which in turn increases your blood pressure . As a result, about 2 of 3 people with diabetes also have hypertension a risk factor for stroke, heart disease, and trouble with thinking and memory. Failing to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol, either with diet and exercise alone or by adding medications, accelerates the rate at which all your other complications progress, says Robert Gabbay, M.D., Ph.D. , chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. 2) Brain health issues "It appears that people with diabetes have some abnormalities of blood flow control to the brain," explains Helena Rodbard, M.D. , an endocrinologist based in Maryland. "And this appears to be correlated with a more rapid loss of mental function with age," she says, including the ability to plan, organize, remember things, prioritize, pay attention, and get started on tasks. To protect your brain health , you'll want to stay active physically and mentally, logging at least 30 minutes of exercise a day and keeping your mind stimulated. "Read, socialize, work, and play games that challenge your intellect," Dr. Rodbard says. "Keep a positive, optimistic attitude don't permit yourself to become depressed ." 3) Gum disease People with diabetes are more likely to develop periodontal disease, an infection of the gum and bone that can lead to painful chewing problems and tooth loss. "This is due in part to elevated blood sugar that modifies the collagen in all of our tissues," Dr. Rodbard says. "It's also due to a slight increase in susceptibility to infections of all kinds." On the other hand, gum disease specifically inflammation of the gums or development of deep abscesses can raise blood sugar and make diabetes harder to control, according to Dr. Hamdy. To prevent periodontitis, brush and floss daily and consider using a mild antiseptic mouthwash to knock out any lingering plaque. 4) Sex difficulties Many men with diabetes will experience some level of erectile dysfunction (ED) in their lifetime. "ED can be psychological or due to reduced testosterone," Dr. Hamdy says, noting that low testosterone is common among people with diabetes, especially if they're obese. "However, in patients with a long duration of diabetes, changes in blood vessels and nerve supply to the penis could be the cause." If you have diabetes, are over age 40, and have been having trouble with your male equipment, see your doctor. Middle-aged and older women with diabetes also tend to have sexual issues, according to a study of nearly 2,300 women published in Obstetrics & Gynecology , likely because nerve damage can impair lubrication and the ability to achieve orgasm . 5) Hearing loss While we all lose some hearing as we age, hearing loss is twice as common in people with diabetes compared to those without the condition, according to the CDC. Diabetes may lead to hearing loss by damaging the small blood vessels and nerves in the inner ear, the CDC says. The best way to protect your hearing is to keep your blood sugar levels in check, Dr. Rodbard says. In fact, in a study from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, older women with uncontrolled diabetes had more hearing loss than women the same age who had well-controlled diabetes. The CDC also suggests getting your hearing checked every year and avoiding other causes of hearing loss, like exposure to loud noises, when possible. 6) Skin infections Having diabetes spikes your risk for all kinds of skin issues, including bacterial infections such as boils and urinary tract infections , fungal infections, and itching . "Fungal infections, especially yeast infections , are so common that they may even be the first sign of diabetes in someone who hasn't yet been diagnosed," Dr. Hamdy says. In some cases, skin infections can be tied to obesity, because there are "moist places between skin folds that may breed bacteria and fungi, including candida ," Dr. Rodbard says. Unfortunately, several diabetes medications increase the risk of fungal infections of the genitalia, Dr. Hamdy says, because they enhance glucose excretion in urine, fueling growth of bacteria and fungus. Controlling blood sugar levels helps with prevention, but once you have an infection, seek out the usual treatments : over-the-counter antifungal vaginal creams and suppositories, to be used as directed. 7) Obstructive sleep apnea This potentially serious sleep disorder , in which the throat muscles intermittently relax and block the airway during sleep, affects around 50% of people with diabetes, Dr. Hamdy says, especially those who are obese and have a collar size of more than 17 for men and 16 for women. The most obvious sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is audible snoring. Unfortunately, like gum disease, "sleep apnea may worsen diabetes control," Dr. Hamdy says, possibly because the two conditions share risk factors. Treatment for OSA may involve using a device to keep your airway open at night or wearing a mouthpiece that thrusts your jaw forward. In severe cases, surgery can help by altering the structure of the nose, mouth, or throat. 8) Vision problems Roughly 1 in 3 people with diabetes older than age 40 have diabetic retinopathy, or damage to the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This happens because elevated blood glucose levels over time harm the eye's delicate blood vessels, a process that can begin as early as 7 years before diagnosis. The good news is, treating these problems early can reduce risk of blindness by 95%, per the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). 9) Kidney failure Over time, high blood glucose thickens and scars the nephrons, tiny structures within the kidneys that filter your blood. About 7% of the time, you'll already have protein leaking into your urine an early sign of kidney problems  by the time you receive a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. About half of those who don't take steps to control their diabetes will sustain kidney damage within 10 years, and 40% of those will progress to kidney failure, a condition requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant, says Betul Hatipoglu, M.D. , an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic. 10) Neuropathy About half of people with type 2 diabetes will develop neuropathy, the most common diabetes complication. At first, you might have no symptoms or feel a mild tingling or numbness in your hands or feet , says Dr. Gabbay. But eventually, this form of nerve damage can cause pain, weakness, and digestive troubles as it strikes the nerves that control your gastrointestinal tract. In addition to managing your blood sugar, being physically active, eating a healthy diet, and keeping up with recommended medications can help prevent diabetes-related nerve damage, the NIDDK says .
AAAcG3S	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	16 hacks to make your boxed cake taste better	Boxed cake mix doesn't have to be boring.	Boxed cake mix doesn't have to be boring. There is no shame in playing the boxed mix game. They're easy, quick, and nostalgia makes them crowd favorites. If you're stuck in a boxed mix rut, there are baking hacks to making your cake taste like it came from a bakery, or giving it unusual flavors you never thought you could achieve with just a mix. Try these add-ins and swaps to make your boxed cake legendary. Start with the holy grail of cake hacks Add an extra egg, swap oil for butter, and replace water with milk. This is a tried-and-true must of a recipe for taking any boxed cake mix to the next level. The additional egg adds decadence, the butter gives a better flavor, and the milk adds density. Jennifer Nigro from Spoon University uses these sworn-by directions to amp up her cupcakes. Add hot water to chocolate boxed mix. Once you've chosen your chocolate mix , Sunny Anderson from The Food Network suggests adding hot water instead of room temperature water . "Hot water allows the cocoa in the mix to 'bloom' or, develop its flavor … That cocoa powder has been sitting in the box for a while - you need to wake the flavor up!" Use coffee instead of water. Kasey at All Things Mamma suggests using brewed coffee instead of water to "deepen the flavor" in chocolate cake mixes. And if you combine this with Sunny Anderson's hot liquid trick, there's no way your cake won't be the hit of the party. Add mayonnaise   yes, mayonnaise   to your cake. Seriously ! "For those of you turning up your noses, think about it: mayonnaise is really just oil, eggs, and a bit of acid, like vinegar." Bakery owner Liz Gutman told the Kitchn "oil makes the cake tender, and the vinegar punches up the chocolate flavor a little." Two tablespoons of mayo could be your new secret ingredient. For a healthy fix, use mashed banana and Greek yogurt. If you're watching your diet, trade the additional ingredients for healthier swaps . Use 1/2 a mashed banana instead of an egg and 3/4 cup of Greek yogurt per cup of oil. Dr. Oz clocks this recipe at just 185 calories per serving. Change the egg structure for a new texture. Sunny Anderson gifted The Rachael Ray Show with her two opposing techniques that both end up in deliciousness. Try adding the amount of eggs listed plus an additional two egg yolks. This means "more fat which gives the cake ultra moistness." You can alternatively revoke the yolks; only adding the egg white to the cake makes the cake "fluffy and whiter." If you only add egg whites, you will need to compensate with an extra two tablespoons of butter. Use your favorite ice cream. Anne Byrn's 1999 melted ice cream cake recipe from The Cake Mix Doctor is still in rotation today. She combines one package of plain white cake mix with eggs and 2 cups of melted ice cream (your choice of flavor). It's a fan favorite because "your liquid, your fat, and your flavorings are all in the melted ice cream." If you've always dreamed of an easy cake with an unusual flavor, like mint chocolate chip or cappuccino, this could be your answer. Don't be afraid to spice it up. Casa Watkins Living has your handy-dandy spice chart to make your cakes spicy and flavorful. Remix your mix by adding a teaspoon of cinnamon to chocolate or yellow cake mixes, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to yellow cake mixes, 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika to chocolate cake mixes, or 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of allspice with 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger for a vanilla cake mix. Dollop in some sour cream for that bakery-cake style. Kacey at All Things Mamma suggests adding 1/2 cup of sour cream to absolutely any cake "to add a more dense, rich flavor." Add flavored pudding to complements the cake. For extra creaminess and flavor, try adding pudding to the mix. A small box of instant pudding will add moisture and flavor. Try butterscotch for vanilla cake or chocolate for chocolate cake. Build in some Greek yogurt for a creamy addition. Even if you're not on a diet, Greek yogurt is a delicious element for flavoring boxed cake or pancake mixes. One Good Thing makes a case for supplementing lemon yogurt to lemon, butter, yellow, spice, and white cake mixes, but you can experiment with any flavor of yogurt. Pour in a can of soda for a fun new flavor. "Adding soda to cake may sound bizarre, but it really does amplify the flavor tremendously, without being overbearing," said the baking wizards at Wonder How To. Dark sodas, like root beer, can intensify chocolate cakes, while citrusy lemon-lime carbonated beverages can turn your white mixes into something else. HuffPost has a list to get you started , but feel free to get funky with it, and even try adding alcohol . Turn it into a poke cake. When the cake is done baking, Baking Chocolatess will "poke holes into it and then pour pudding, sweetened condensed milk, syrups, gelatin or sauces into the holes and let them soak in the cake and refrigerate overnight!" Voila. "Wayyyy better." Pump up those flavorings. If what you dislike about boxed mix is the artificial flavoring, supplement your own, according to Working Mother . A splash of vanilla extract will work wonders in any cake, while lemon, almond, or maple extract will give your cake a deliciously fun boost. Make it pretty with gel food coloring. Do you love the flavor, but still want the wow factor? Add color. Julie Deily from The Little Kitchen doctored a white mix with just gel food coloring for this totally Instagrammable Rainbow Birthday Cake . Raid your cabinet for any additional fun ingredients. Got extra walnuts lying around? Leftover Halloween candies? Throw 'em in . Chocolate chips, raisins, sprinkles, or whatever you've got, grab about half a cup to add to the batter, or even sprinkle on top. If you're adding wet items like fruit, Nigella Lawson suggests you toss them in the dry ingredients first , so they don't sink to the bottom. The only rule for this one is that there are no rules. There are endless delicious ways to bring your box mixes to the next level.
AAAR7gM	news	newspolitics	'Lock her up' redux? Biden's son becomes the right's new target	Clinton veterans say the attacks on Hunter Biden are giving them painful flashbacks to 2016.	President Donald Trump's political allies and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have begun mobilizing to cast a legal cloud over Joe Biden and demanding that the Justice Department should open an investigation that could ensnare the former vice president as he launches his 2020 presidential bid. "Biden conflicts are too apparent to be ignored and should be investigated quickly and expeditiously," Giuliani tweeted Thursday morning. The suggestion of illegal behavior and the specter of putting a political opponent behind bars sounded familiar to some senior campaign aides to Hillary Clinton, who believe Trump and his allies are running a version of their "Crooked Hillary" playbook from 2016. "Last time, he had the right-wing conspiracy media to boost his chants of 'lock her up,' but this time he's going to actually weaponize the federal government against our nominee," said Jesse Ferguson, a senior spokesperson on the Clinton campaign. The attacks on Biden pivot off the lucrative business activities of his son Hunter during the Obama administration, most notably Hunter's work on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings. As part of a long campaign to pressure Ukraine to combat corruption in 2015 and 2016, then-Vice President Biden leveraged financial aid to the country in order to convince the government to fire the country's top prosecutor. That prosecutor, who had been roundly criticized by the international community for corruption, had been investigating Burisma at the time. Related slideshow: Joe Biden through the years (USA TODAY) The unseemly optics of Biden's son appearing to benefit financially from his father's diplomacy were reported by the New York Times in 2015, though Biden's office has long maintained that Hunter's work had no bearing on the Vice President's approach to Ukraine. But the story has slowly re-emerged over the past year   largely on the right and in conservative media   as a Biden presidential run appeared increasingly likely. It exploded again on Wednesday night when the New York Times reported that Giuliani has met with Ukraine's new prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, multiple times this year and has discussed the Burisma case with him and the prosecutor Biden helped oust, Viktor Shokin. Lutsenko reopened the investigation into Burisma earlier this year. Giuliani also told the Times that he has discussed the Biden-Ukraine case with Trump himself. Giuliani has been suggesting that the Biden case must be investigated as part of the larger inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation, which may involve Ukraine. In a Fox News interview in early April, Giuliani spoke at length about the Biden case but said it was only because of broader questions about the Russia investigation. "I'm bringing it up now because I want Ukraine   I don't care about Joe Biden. I want that Ukraine investigated," he said . "Because I think in the Ukraine, we are going to find a lot of answers for how the Steele dossier was put together." Attorney General William Barr told Congress this week that he is looking into the origins of the Russia investigation. Asked if Biden's team was worried about a federal investigation, the former vice president's campaign declined to comment. Trump has fixated on Biden over the past week, tweeting and retweeting about him far more than any other potential 2020 rival. That included a retweet of the Times' Ukraine story. Hunter Biden could not be reached for comment, but he told the Times in a statement, "I have had no role whatsoever in relation to any investigation of Burisma, or any of its officers … I explicitly limited my role to focus on corporate governance best practices to facilitate Burisma's desire to expand globally." The uproar hasn't come as a total surprise to Biden-world. In the run-up to his announcement, Joe Biden fretted to confidantes that Hunter would become a campaign-trail issue. Aside from critical reports concerning Hunter Biden's business arrangements in Ukraine as well as China, he has been a tabloid favorite for his reported cocaine use and for leaving his wife for his brother's widow, who is a friend of Michelle Obama, according to the New York Post , which also reported this week that Hunter Biden broke up with his brother's widow just in time for his father's campaign launch. Related video: Hunter Biden splits from late brother Beau's widow (Daily Mail) Some veterans of Democratic presidential campaigns see echoes of 2016 in the way the story had staying power in the conservative media ecosystem and then gradually re-emerged into the mainstream. "It's happening all over again," tweeted former Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer. "Peter Schweizer does oppo research funded by conservative interests --> NYT credulously writes it up --> Trump and his allies bully the DOJ into investigating --> Trump claims his opponent is corrupt." "If you think this is oppo from @peterschweizer or @RudyGiuliani , you did not read the story very carefully," the story's author, Ken Vogel, responded. Schweizer also responded to Pfeiffer on Twitter. "It's called investigative journalism not oppo research," he wrote. "What facts to do dispute?" Schweizer, a conservative journalist, published "Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends" in 2018, a book looking at potential corruption of Republican and Democratic establishment figures. On the cover, Biden features prominently and is joined by Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell, Jared Kushner and John Kerry. The book dedicates significant portions to Hunter Biden's private-sector work, including in Ukraine. Schweizer is the author of the 2015 book "Clinton Cash" with the encouragement of Breitbart's Steve Bannon. He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a group funded by the Mercer family, which also bankrolled Breitbart at the time of "Clinton Cash." The book was ultimately cited in a large investigation by The New York Times about a Russia uranium deal and a subsequent story about the Clinton Foundation's work in Haiti. "The Times' hand-in-glove arrangement with Steve Bannon's 'Clinton Cash' project was one of the major press fiascos of the 2016 cycle," said the Clinton campaign's Brian Fallon, who took the lead on responding to many of the "Clinton Cash" questions during the campaign. "It is mind-blowing and journalistically reckless that the Times is going down this road again. The Times is making itself an accomplice to a scheme whereby Trump likely intends to put his potential Democratic opponent under federal investigation for partisan reasons." Schweizer said he did not speak to the Times about the Biden story and defended his reporting to POLITICO. "Hunter Biden's international business dealings   from China to Ukraine   deserve scrutiny," he said. "The Times coverage is likely to make this topic a centerpoint of the 2020 campaign." And that may be true, at least on the right. The story spread far and wide across conservative media Thursday. One Breitbart headline read: "NYT Confirms Hunter Biden Was Paid by Ukrainians While Father Was VP." One America News Network published a story headlined "Giuliani: Biden's Conflicts Of Interest, Alleged Corruption Must Be Probed." Laura Ingraham had Schweizer on her Fox News show. "The left is also blame-shifting on a story we've covered extensively on 'Ingraham Angle,'" said Ingraham. "The Biden family's sketchy ties to Ukraine." The Kremlin-backed news agency RT also has been playing up the Biden-Ukraine connection, publishing a story in early April headlined "Joe Biden's past strong-arming in Ukraine is coming back to haunt him."

AAxN4SL	health	medical	Survivor of near-fatal tick bite has a lesson for summer	On the eve of Memorial Day weekend, Jennifer Slone wants you to know that bug bites are more than just itchy. They can be deadly.	On the eve of Memorial Day weekend, Jennifer Slone wants you to know that bug bites are more than just itchy. They can be deadly. And they're pretty easy to avoid. For two weeks last summer, Slone, a librarian from Waverly, Ohio, languished in the hospital as doctors struggled to get her fever down from over 104 degrees. She developed meningitis. Her liver was suffering. She became septic, an infection raging through her bloodstream. She needed three blood transfusions. Slone had ehrlichiosis , a bacterial infection from a tick bite. "I was petrified," said her husband, Nick. "I thought this was it, this was the end." Slone did survive and, after 11 days in the hospital, much of which she doesn't remember, was able to go home. "I am so happy to be alive!" she wrote on Facebook after she got out of the hospital. Slone said she still finds it hard to wrap her head around the fact that a bug bite got her so sick. "I grew up my whole life running around with ticks on me, and I never thought anything of it," said Slone, 36. "But this was just one extremely special tick." Or perhaps not so special. This month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that diseases from ticks and mosquitoes are on the rise . From 2004 to 2016, the number of tick-borne disease cases grew from 22,527 to 48,610, according to a CDC report. During that time period, the number of cases of mosquito-borne diseases jumped from 4,858 to 47,461. Nine of the 16 diseases included in the study are relatively new, having been identified only since 2004. One of the new diseases is a variant of ehrlichiosis, the infection Slone suffered. Scientists think it's going to get even worse. Maps show that by 2080, tick habitats are expected to include much of the eastern half of the country. The maps are part of a 2014 report by the US Global Change Research Program, a government agency, which concludes that climate change is one reason for the increase in disease-bearing ticks and mosquitoes. The University of Massachusetts is ground zero for tick research. Every week, thousands of people from across the country send ticks to its TickReport program to be tested for diseases. This helps people know what kind of medical treatment they might need. "It's important to know early, because most of these diseases can be treated more effectively if they're treated early," said Stephen Rich, a microbiologist and director of TickReport. Symptoms of tick-borne illness often look like the flu or other sicknesses, so unless a doctor asks about a tick bite, a patient might not receive the right treatment, Rich said. Thankfully, when Slone showed up at the emergency room at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center with a high fever and vomiting, doctors thought to ask whether she'd been bit by a tick. She told them she remembered taking one off her stomach weeks before. Doctors started her on the antibiotic doxycycline. It took several days for the antibiotic to bring her fever down, and three months for her to fully recover. Her illness was first reported in the Pike County News Watchman . Slone thinks the tick bit her in her yard or her friend's yard. At first, after she recovered, she was nervous about going outside. But she loves gardening, and she wanted to dress up the yard in her family's new home. "I've decided I love nature, and I am not going to let something like this make me afraid," she said. "Other people shouldn't be afraid of nature either as long as you take the necessary precautions." That includes wearing long sleeves and long pants. She tucks her shirt into her pants and her pants into her boots to make sure bugs don't creep up her belly or legs. She sprays herself with an insect repellent that includes DEET or another chemical approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency and checks her entire body after coming inside from the yard or a walk in the woods. "It would be terrible to get sick when it's so easily preventable," Slone said. "This is more serious than people recognize." CNN's John Bonifield and Amy Roberts contributed to this report.

BBLSQ3o	autos	autosclassics	An infestation of Oldsmobile Jetfires	Most people have never heard of the Oldsmobile Jetfire. It was released just a few weeks after its more famous corporate twin, the Corvair Turbo.	Most people have never heard of the Oldsmobile Jetfire. It was released just a few weeks after its more famous corporate twin, the Corvair Turbo. Unlike the Corvair, Jetfires came with the 215ci, aluminum V8. Only produced for two years, they are all but forgotten. A few years ago, HOT ROD documented the rescue of a garage-find 1962 Jetfire ( Oldsmobile's Lost Turbo V8 Discovered in an Illinois Garage ). The gentleman who bought that car had its exact twin with an automatic transmission. That wasn't the end, though; the new owner started collecting more of them, and as of February 2018, he had the largest collection of Jetfire cars, parts, and even complete drop-out engines! His most recent acquisition was another spare engine and two more cars. One is in nice condition, but the other is pretty rough, with no interior or engine. It was so hard to find parts, he figured he may as well buy the whole car. You can follow me on social media at Instagram: TheAutoArchaeologist, Facebook: The Auto Archaeologist.

Because of that, it ranks near the bottom of the large car class.	A gentle ride and a large trunk aren't enough to offset the 2019 Ford Taurus' tight rear seats, tedious handling, and unimpressive cabin. Because of that, it ranks near the bottom of the large car class. Is the Ford Taurus a Good Car? The Ford Taurus is just OK. This comfortable cruiser has a sizable trunk for a large car , and its optional SYNC 3 infotainment system is easy to use. Unfortunately, its shortcomings mostly outweigh these gains, which is why it places so low in our rankings. The Taurus gets terrible gas mileage and has a middling base engine. Families will frown over its surprisingly cramped back seat and short list of standard safety features. And because the current generation is almost a decade old, the interior looks and feels dated alongside many rivals. Should I Buy the Ford Taurus? If you need a large car and are on a tight budget, the Ford Taurus sedan is worth considering. It's one of the most affordable vehicles in its class. However, almost every other large car is a better value. The Chevrolet Impala offers balanced handling and roomy rear seats, and the Kia Cadenza boasts a lavish cabin with plenty of standard tech features. Should I Buy a New or Used Ford Taurus? The 2019 Taurus is your last chance to buy a new Taurus, as production is ending with this model year. However, you're probably better off buying a used model instead. This car's current generation launched for 2010, and major changes since then include a refresh for 2013. The 2016 Taurus also received a significant tech upgrade, as its much-maligned MyFord Touch infotainment system was replaced with the optional SYNC 3 interface. Ford discontinued the turbocharged four-cylinder engine for 2018, and a power-adjustable steering wheel is no longer available for 2019. Among recent model years, you're likely to find the best combination of price and features with a 2016 or 2017 model. To research some other models in this generation, check out our reviews of the 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 Ford Taurus .

The base 2019 Ford Taurus SE has a starting price of $27,800, making it one of the most affordable large cars . In fact, most class rivals retail for more than $30,000, putting them on par with the midlevel Ford Taurus SEL. The performance-oriented Taurus SHO has a base price of $42,975. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Ford dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Ford deals page . Ford Taurus Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Ford Taurus or Toyota Avalon? Toyota fully redesigned the Avalon for the 2019 model year, and the updates help make it a great large car . The Avalon boasts higher fuel economy estimates, more room for passengers, and a longer list of standard features than the Taurus, including lots of standard safety features. It can also hold its own on winding roads much better than the Taurus can. On the other hand, the Taurus is more affordable, with a starting price that is $7,700 less than the Avalon's. Even the midlevel Ford Taurus SEL will save you more than $5,300 compared to the base Avalon. It also offers all-wheel drive, something you can't get in the Avalon. If your budget allows it, however, the Avalon is a better pick. Which Is Better: Ford Taurus or Chevrolet Impala? With a gentle ride and good composure around turns, the Chevrolet Impala is a smart choice in the class. It offers a spacious cabin with some of the roomiest rear seats in the class. The Impala has more standard features and an intuitive infotainment system, and it retails for only $200 more than the Ford. However, the Impala has a standard four-cylinder engine, and upgrading to its available V6 engine will cost you extra. While the Taurus has a little more trunk space and available all-wheel drive, the Impala is a better choice overall. Taurus Interior How Many People Does the Taurus Seat? This Ford sedan seats five people. Cloth upholstery and power-adjustable front seats are standard. Leather seats; massaging, heated, and ventilated front seats; heated rear seats; and a heated steering wheel are available. Most adults will be comfortable in the front seats, but thick roof pillars make the cabin feel tight. Rear-seat space is friendlier to kids than adults. Taurus and Child Car Seats This sedan has two complete sets of LATCH connectors on the rear outboard seats. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety gave the system its second-highest rating of Acceptable for ease of use, noting that the anchors are located too deep in the seats. Taurus Interior Quality The Taurus has a nice-looking cabin, but you won't mistake it for a Mercedes-Benz. Rivals like the Chrysler 300 have more modern interiors with higher-quality materials. Taurus Cargo Space This vehicle has 20.1 cubic feet of trunk space. That's one of the roomiest among large sedans, eclipsing the Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse , though wagons such as the Ford C-Max Hybrid have a lot more space. Taurus Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The Taurus comes standard with the SYNC smartphone connectivity interface, which features a 4.2-inch screen, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a six-speaker sound system. Upgrades include the SYNC 3 infotainment system, an 8-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a second USB port, satellite radio, HD Radio, navigation, and a moonroof. With its large, responsive touch screen, SYNC 3 is a worthwhile upgrade. It also comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. For more information, read What Is Apple CarPlay? and What Is Android Auto? Taurus Performance Taurus Engine: Take It or Leave It Ford offers two powertrains in the 2019 Taurus. The standard 3.5-liter V6 engine puts out 288 horsepower. The Taurus SHO trim has a twin-turbocharged EcoBoost variant of this engine with ratings of 365 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. Both engines are powerful enough for daily driving and highway jaunts. The EcoBoost V6 delivers quicker acceleration and feels more powerful when getting up to speed or cruising along. However, the base engine isn't as robust as what you'll find in a number of the Taurus' more recently updated rivals. Taurus Mileage: Subpar for the Class This vehicle gets an EPA-estimated 18 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway. The Ford Taurus SHO and its twin-turbocharged engine get 16 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. Those are low estimates compared to other large cars , some of which have base four-cylinders instead of V6s. But even among rivals with a V6, the Ford earns subpar estimates. Both the Chevrolet Impala and Kia Cadenza can save you money at the pump. Taurus Ride and Handling: Comfortable Ride The Ford Taurus sedan has a gentle, cushioned ride. It's a great cruising vehicle, but you'll never forget you're driving a full-size car. It leans around corners and can be hard to maneuver. The sport-oriented SHO trim handles a little better, but it still falls short of some rivals' handling. Front-wheel drive comes standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. Taurus Reliability Is the Taurus Reliable? J.D. Power gives the 2019 Taurus a slightly above-average predicted reliability rating of 3.5 out of five. Taurus Warranty Ford covers the Taurus with a basic warranty lasting three years or 36,000 miles and a powertrain warranty lasting five years or 60,000 miles. Most large cars have similar terms. Taurus Safety Taurus Crash Test Results The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2019 Ford Taurus five out of five stars overall, with four stars in the rollover test and five stars in every other test conducted. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the highest rating of Good in four crash tests and the second-highest rating of Acceptable in the small overlap front test. IIHS gave the front crash prevention technology a Basic rating and gave the headlights a rating of Poor. Both of those ratings are the lowest in their test categories. Taurus Safety Features This full-size car has a standard rearview camera and Ford's MyKey, which lets you do things like set speed and audio limits for secondary drivers. Rivals like the Buick LaCrosse and Toyota Avalon have more standard safety features. The Taurus also offers blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, rear parking sensors, and parallel park assist. Taurus Dimensions and Weight The Taurus is 16 feet, 11 inches long. It has a base curb weight of 3,917 pounds. Where is the 2019 Ford Taurus Built? Ford builds the Taurus in Illinois. Which Ford Taurus Model Is Right for Me? Ford offers this large sedan in four trim levels: SE, SEL, Limited, and the performance-oriented SHO. If you're after a large family sedan, the Ford Taurus SEL is a good choice. It gains a few tech and comfort features over the base SE, and it's the first trim available with the SYNC 3 infotainment system. The Ford Taurus Limited adds even more, but it comes with a fairly large price jump. Shoppers after something more athletic should look to the Ford Taurus SHO, as it's the only trim with a sport-tuned suspension and the stronger V6 engine. Ford Taurus SE The 2019 Ford Taurus SE has an MSRP of $27,800. That buys you a 288-horsepower V6 engine, remote keyless entry, aluminum wheels, cloth seats, a rearview camera, and the SYNC smartphone connectivity system with a 4.2-inch display, a six-speaker stereo, a USB port, and Bluetooth. You'll also get Ford's MyKey, which lets you do things like set speed and audio limits for secondary drivers. No notable packages or options are available with the SE trim. Ford Taurus SEL With a starting price of $30,230, the Ford Taurus SEL adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, upgraded cloth seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, remote start, satellite radio, and rear parking sensors. The Ford Taurus SEL is the first trim available with several options. All-wheel drive is a $1,850 add-on, and for $1,050, you can equip the Taurus with the 201A package to get push-button start, proximity keyless entry, and the SYNC 3 infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Voice-activated navigation is available for $795. Other options include leather and heated front seats ($1,495) and a moonroof ($995). Ford Taurus Limited The Ford Taurus Limited starts at $37,310 and adds the contents of the 201A package as standard. You'll also get heated, ventilated, and 10-way power-adjustable front seats; heated rear seats; leather seats; and a heated steering wheel. The Limited also features a 12-speaker Sony sound system, HD Radio, blind spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alert, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic high beams, and larger aluminum wheels. All-wheel drive, navigation, and the moonroof remain optional. For $1,995, a Driver Assist package adds lane keep assist, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and parallel park assist. Ford Taurus SHO The 2019 Ford Taurus SHO retails for $42,975. As the performance-minded model in the lineup, it has a sport-tuned suspension, a twin-turbo EcoBoost engine making 365 horsepower, and standard all-wheel drive. A moonroof, navigation, and the Driver Assist package remain available. Ford also offers a SHO Performance package for $1,300. It upgrades the tires, brakes, and suspension. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Ford dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Ford deals page . The Final Call The Ford Taurus places toward the bottom of our large car rankings , in part because it gets poor gas mileage and doesn't look as modern as its rivals. These drawbacks aren't necessarily deal breakers on their own, and the Taurus does have some nice qualities. Still, most shoppers are better with one of the Taurus' competitors. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis.

The so-called golden years can be financially challenging, but state and federal tax breaks provide something of a silver lining. Taxes on Social Security are off-limits in some places, and property taxes are often discounted. Downsizing to a smaller place can be an opportunity in itself. Find out what's available. Silver Linings With age comes wisdom, as well as certain tax breaks. While seniors often face lower income and higher expenses (think health care and assisted living ), there are also numerous federal and state rules aimed at easing their tax burden. Many seniors have questions about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and how it will affect them, and there are significant changes for most filers . Here are some tax breaks and tips to remember during the golden years. Standard Deduction The standard deduction has nearly doubled. This means that for about 94% of Americans, the standard deduction will make it no longer beneficial to itemize. The standard deduction is now $12,200 for single taxpayers and $24,400 for married couples. Seniors still get a bit of a bump. Single taxpayers 65 and older can deduct an additional $1,600; for couples, the increase is $1,300 if one spouse is 65 or older and $2,600 if both spouses are at least 65. Related: Why You Might Not Need a Tax Pro Property Taxes Every state has some sort of property-tax benefit for seniors (often referred to as a homestead exemption), although the eligibility age varies. Six states have programs that freeze property taxes completely for seniors, and some states limit how much a property's tax value can increase. Also, the homestead exemption can be larger when a homeowner reaches a certain age. (The larger the exemption, the lower the tax.) In Colorado, seniors 65 and older can exempt up to 50% of their residence's first $200,000 in value. In Alabama, taxpayers 65 and older are exempt from the state portion of their property tax. Income Exclusions Some states let senior taxpayers exclude quite a bit of income before taxes kick in: up to $65,000 in Georgia, $31,110 in Kentucky, and $68,000 in Tennessee. New Jersey is phasing in a deduction that will allow married residents to exclude up to $100,000 of retirement income by tax year 2020. In Rhode Island, there is a $15,000 exemption on all retirement income up to $83,450 for singles and $104,350 for married couples. Social Security In 37 states, Social Security benefits are not taxed , either because there is no state income tax or because Social Security is subtracted from federal adjusted gross income. At the federal level, if income is under $25,000 for a single person or $32,000 for a couple, Social Security benefits are not taxed. Above that, between 50% and 85% of those benefits are taxed, depending on income. Free and Clear Seven states   Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming   exempt all individual income from taxes. In New Mexico, people over 100 don't have to pay taxes on any income. Two states, Tennessee and New Hampshire, tax only dividend and interest income. However, Tennessee is phasing this out, so that it will be eliminated by 2022. Limited Pension Exemptions In 14 of the 41 states that have an income tax, military and usually government and civil service pensions are exempt. In addition, 21 states offer at least a partial exemption of pension income. No Filing for Low-income Seniors Married couples 65 and older with income (not including Social Security) under $27,000 do not have to file a federal return at all. The limit is $25,700 if one spouse is under 65, and $13,850 for individuals. Saver's Tax Credit People looking toward the future can take advantage of this tax break before they retire. It's a tax credit toward the first 50%, 20%, or 10% of $2,000 ($4,000 filing jointly) that's put into a retirement account, such as an IRA or an employer's retirement plan. Eligibility depends on income level, with the credit aimed at low- to moderate-income taxpayers. Those with the lowest income receive the biggest credit. Give It Away Most people are not too worried about the new, higher ceiling of the estate tax . However, there are plenty of good reasons to give away assets before death, even for people of more modest means. Federal law now allows people to give away $15,000 to an individual each year. So, people with five grandchildren can give away up to $75,000, $15,000 to each of them each year. Medical and Dental Expenses People 65 and older can deduct medical and dental expenses   potentially huge for seniors   that total more than 7.5% of their adjusted gross income from 2019 . These expenses include devices like wheelchairs or hearing aids, in-home nursing or caregiving, and prescribed nutritional supplements. To claim the deduction, taxpayers must itemize, which may no longer be advantageous because of the increased standard deduction. Medicare Deductions Medicare Part B premium payments are considered a medical expense. The same goes for prescription plan premiums under Medicare Part D. Since this money comes out of pocket, it's also deductible. Home Downsizing Selling a principal residence for a profit in order to move someplace smaller , or warmer, does not have to incur capital gains taxes. The Internal Revenue Service allows a profit of up to $500,000 for a married couple. Credit for the Elderly and Disabled Seniors 65 and older with income less than $25,000 if married filing jointly or $17,500 if filing individually can get a tax credit of $3,750 to $7,500. This credit also applies to people who had to retire before age 65 because of a disability. Still Investing Seniors can now contribute up to $7,000 (rather than $6,000 for those under 50) to a traditional IRA, as long as they are not withdrawing funds. They might (depending on income) get a tax deduction for that contribution. But contributions are no longer allowed by the IRS the year the account holder turns 70.5. Contributions to a Roth IRA will be taxed, but when that money is withdrawn, it will be tax free. But for 2020 and later, there will be no age limit on making regular contributions to traditional or Roth IRAs. Cashing Out Tax- and penalty-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA can begin at age 59.5 as long as the account is at least 5 years old. The money wasn't tax-deferred when it was contributed, but the interest or other income from the account is tax-free when withdrawn. Roll Over the Money Money invested in a 401(k) with a former employer can be rolled over to an IRA, which has several benefits , such as increasing your investment options. However, if the employer cuts a check to you, rather than to the IRA, that counts as income and will be taxed, and the employer will be required to withhold 20% for taxes. Breaks for Investors Retirees living off their investments get some breaks. Interest income, dividends and capital gains on investments are taxed at a lower rate than regular income, generally 20%, 15% or not at all. And expenses related to investing, like accounting fees, online brokerage fees, and fees to financial planners can be deductible. Charitable Contributions Giving back can pay. People who itemize deductions can deduct cash contributions to qualified charitable organizations that equal up to 50% of adjusted gross income. A senior who is clearing out their house can also deduct the fair-market value of any goods they donate to charity . 529 Plans Seniors looking to help finance their grandkid's education can also get a tax break for themselves with 529 savings plans. Under old laws, a tax-advantaged 529 plan could be used only at eligible colleges and universities. Those plans can now cover $10,000 per year of qualifying expenses for any school and any grade from kindergarten through high school   public, private, and religious institutions included. Existing 529 plans also can be rolled over into ABLE 529 plans for people living with disabilities and for the education of children with disabilities. Home Equity Debt It used to be that home equity debt of up to $100,000 was deductible. Many seniors whose mortgages had been paid off took advantage of that deduction to take out low-interest loans. That deduction has now disappeared and will no longer be allowed. Get Help The AARP Foundation is offering free tax prep to low- and moderate-income seniors (age 50 and up). This help is available at nearly 5,000 locations nationwide, and AARP lists the documents you will need to bring with you.
AAxF8nT	autos	autosnews	First Drive: 2018 Mazda6 Signature 2.5L Turbo	Sedan salvation with seats that suck, but in a good way	PASADENA, California   While some automakers are killing their sedans, others, like Mazda, remain committed to the traditional body style. The 2018 Mazda6 is proof of that commitment. Significantly refreshed, the midsize sedan gets a couple of new shades of paint, a larger mesh grille, a longer and squared off hood, wing design embellishments, and a more powerful engine plucked from a Mazda CX-9 SUV. It's a stylish and efficient combination that provides a good bang for the buck at a base price of $35,640 for the range-topping Signature trim level. As we found out on the twisty roads of Angeles Crest Highway, the updated sedan offers an enjoyable and sporty driving experience despite the lack of a stick especially when you set it in Sport mode and use its paddle shifters aggressively. It reminds me of the Mazda 626 from the 1990s. Under the hood, the CX-9-sourced Skactiv-G 2.5-liter turbo-four produces the same 250 hp and a healthy 310 lb-ft of torque it does in the three-row crossover. It's mated to the same six-speed automatic, though the powertrain was retuned for sedan duty. It's a rather enjoyable ride that's noticeably quicker than the naturally aspirated mill, which produces a lackluster 184 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque. In Signature trim, the 2018 Mazda6 rolls mostly gracefully on 19-inch wheels with all-season rubber and its suspension proved fairly forgiving on the unevenly paved streets and highways we encountered during our test runs. The overall ride experience is actually better than a Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class sedan, thanks mostly to the lack of a start/stop system that kills driving enjoyment in a desperate effort to save fuel. We are grateful for the Mazda engineers that fight to keep that scourge at bay. Instead of start/stop, the Mazda6's turbo-four features cylinder-deactivation voodoo, which shuts off its two outside cylinders at cruising speeds for better fuel efficiency. Steering is fast and easy to control and the brakes really brake with a light touch. Our tester wears a heavy coat of Snowflake White Pearl paint (a $200 option) with warm Chestnut Nappa Leather sports interior, UltraSuede flourishes, and nifty Japanese Sen Wood trim. Inside the soft touch materials look and feel luxurious. Aside from a few carryover switches, the interior is all new, looks smart, and works extremely well on this top trim level. It easily rivals some of Benz' C-Class offerings. (We can't vouch for the lower trim levels, but as my granny used to tell me you get what you pay for) The Mazda6 also sports new sport seats. They don't blow, but they totally suck instead. You see, most air-conditioned seats blow cold air on a passenger's back, which can give them a bit of a chill, but Mazda's utilize a suction fan to suck air away from its occupants, which keep you cool without over doing it. The new tech is a sweet touch that we will prove handy during the summer. They're also super comfy and well padded for the most discerning tuchus. Tech goodies include the usual assortment of lane assist, lane departure, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and other gizmos that beep and prod you into safe driving submission. New for 2018 is the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support  a huge improvement for smartphone junkies. Mazda also equipped the sedan with rain sensing-windshield wipers that come in handy especially at the car wash when you forget to turn them off. In all, the 2018 Mazda6 Signature is worth a closer look if you are in the market for a well-equipped sporty sedan but have no desire to break the bank on a premium marque. 2018 Mazda6 Signature Edition 2.5L Turbo Specifications ON SALE Now PRICE $35,640 (base) / $36,040 (as configured) ENGINE 2.5L turbocharged DOHC 16-valve I-4/250 hp @ 5,000 rpm, 310 lb-ft @ 2,000 rpm TRANSMISSION 6-speed automatic LAYOUT 4-door, 5-passenger, front-engine, FWD sedan EPA MILEAGE 23/31 mpg (city/hwy) L x W x H 191.5 x 72.4 x 57.1 in WHEELBASE 111.4 in WEIGHT 3,305 lb 0-60 MPH 7.2 sec (est) TOP SPEED 135 mph (est)

BBKJtyu	health	wellness	The Harmful Effects of Instant Ramen Noodles	Women who ate instant noodles frequently were found to be more likely to have metabolic syndrome, according to a study. Here's what you need to know about a preservative called TBHQ.	Yes, you know that instant ramen isn't good for you, but studies have confirmed just how harmful the prepackaged food can really be. A study in the Journal of Nutrition links instant noodle consumption with heart risk , particularly in women. The researchers conducted a study in South Korea, where consumption of instant noodles is the highest in the world, with more than 10,700 people ranging in age from 19 to 64. The results? "Women who consume instant noodles frequently were found to be more likely to have metabolic syndrome - the group of risk factors, including obesity and high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes." The harmful effects were predominantly found in women and not men. Part of the study reads, "Women - though not men - who ate instant noodles at least twice a week showed a 68 percent higher risk of metabolic syndrome," which is a syndrome that can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The high sodium content in instant noodle products is obvious, but the main culprit is the noodles themselves. In another study by Dr. Braden Kuo, director of the gastrointestinal motility laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital at Harvard University, the doctor found unsettling results after testing digestion of the noodles. He used a tiny camera to study the breakdown of instant ramen noodles in the stomach and found out just how difficult it is for your body to digest the preservative-filled noodles. Warning: the photos are graphic. A preservative called TBHQ , which is found in many processed foods including Reese's and Chicken McNuggets , extends shelf life of fatty foods and makes them harder to digest. It's one of the many ingredients in Maruchan Chicken Ramen . If you're hopelessly devoted to instant ramen (and it's a budget-friendly staple in your life), all hope is not lost. Dr. Frank B. Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard, told The New York Times , "Once or twice a month is not a problem, but a few times a week really is." Moral of the story: eating college-friendly instant ramen is OK, but moderation is key. Slideshow: FDA-approved additives you probably shouldn't eat (SheKnows)
BBV2YJR	lifestyle	lifestylecleaningandorganizing	Spring Cleaning: 51 Things to Toss Right Now	Take advantage of the warmer weather to start your spring cleaning purge now. You'll end up with a cleaner, healthier, and more organized house when you are finished. From old makeup to worn shoes to takeout condiments and unneeded formalwear, here are the things to toss ASAP in the name of decluttering.	Take advantage of the warmer weather to start your spring cleaning purge now. You'll end up with a cleaner, healthier, and more organized house when you are finished. From old makeup to worn shoes to takeout condiments and unneeded formalwear, here are the things to toss ASAP in the name of decluttering. Process of Elimination Spring often brings an urge to purge. A disorganized home can make you feel overwhelmed, and decluttering can actually help save money and even bring a little extra dough . Even if the overload isn't so bad you're thinking of renting a storage unit, being honest about what you actually use and what's gathering dust can help you make smarter buying decisions in the future. Less clutter can also keep you from buying the same item again because you can't find what you already have. Clearing the entire house of clutter takes time, so start by targeting these things you can throw away now. Clothes One of the biggest areas of embarrassment for many people is their closets. As a rule of thumb, get rid of anything you haven't worn in the past year. Taking inventory with each change of season is a good way to identify what you do and don't wear and, in the end, what you should clear out. Kids' Clothes After cleaning out your own closet, tackle the kids' closets. Children's closets get even more cluttered because they outgrow things constantly or (let's face it) stain or rip them. Make it a habit to get rid of unworn, outgrown, or ruined clothing. Shoes Go through and toss any shoes you haven't worn in the past year and any that are simply worn out. No sense keeping them if you won't or can't wear them. Tip: When you buy new shoes, part with at least one pair to keep the clutter at bay. Wire Hangers Wire hangers can actually damage your clothes . They simply don't offer enough support for heavy clothing, and over time the clothes can become misshapen, especially in the shoulders. Formalwear That bridesmaid dress may have cost more than you wanted to spend, but it won't be seeing any action anytime soon, if ever again. Why not donate it and free up closet space for something you'll wear often? Bridesmaid dresses make great prom dresses for girls who can't otherwise afford them. Ditto on that old suit: Give it to someone who's down on their luck and interviewing for jobs (try an organization such as Dress For Success ). Single Socks Everyone likely has a few loose socks without a mate. Designate a space in your dresser where they can hang out for two weeks; if you can't complete the pairs, into the trash they go. Old Towels How many towels do you really need? The book "Unclutter Your Life in One Week" offers a simple formula : two sets for each occupant and guest room in your home (use one while the other is in the laundry). Consider donating the rest to a homeless shelter or an animal shelter. Old Sheets Sheets don't need changing more than once a week. Sure, kids have accidents, and people get sick on occasion, but two sets of sheets per bed (three at the most) should suffice. The rest you can go ahead and get rid of now. Sunscreen Not only does sunscreen have an expiration date (typically within three years), but if it's exposed to extreme heat (say, sitting in a bag on the beach) it can break down much faster. Definitely dispose of any sunscreen that's expired, but also dump any that's been exposed to hot sun. Mascara Mascara has a three-month shelf life once opened. Beyond that, it can start to break down and cause skin and eye irritation, beauty experts say. Many women likely have expired mascara in their makeup bag right now. Tip: Write the date you opened the mascara on the tube, so you know when to throw it out. Eye Shadow Unlike mascara, eye shadow (powder) can last up to two years. But if you're hoarding colors for that rare occasion when they might come in handy, chances are you won't come back around to them. And if you do, it's likely healthier to just get new shadow. Lipstick Lipstick and gloss can last up to one year. But again, if you've stopped using the shade, or it doesn't look quite right, just toss it and replace it with a color you're into right now. There's no need for more than one or two colors that flatter your complexion. Nail Polish When nail polish begins to separate, it's time to toss it. You can only wear so much polish at a time anyway, so cleaning out old bottles or colors you don't love is a good way to declutter. Hair-Care Products Like makeup, hair-care products have a limited shelf life, whether they are marked or not. Three years is typical. After that, they can become ineffective, and grow mold and bacteria. Toss anything older than three years and anything you haven't used in the past year. Old Toothbrushes While it may be tempting to stockpile toothbrushes from the dentist (most give you one at every visit), they should be replaced more frequently than that. Whenever you get a new one, just replace the old one to avoid getting a collection going. And if you haven't changed out your toothbrush in the past four months, or you've been sick recently, swap out your toothbrush now . Hotel Toiletries It's tempting to scoop up all those toiletry samples as you check out of a hotel   you'll use them eventually, right? Most likely wrong. If you have tons of little bottles taking up space in your bathroom, it's time to let them go. Many homeless shelters can use them. Expired Medications Expired medicine loses its effectiveness, and certain medications can be very harmful if the wrong person gets ahold of them. It's best to dispose of unwanted medicines properly, as recommended by the FDA . Collection sites will be set up for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on April 25. Foods With Freezer Burn If something in your freezer is developing freezer burn, it's time to toss it. Also, toss anything that isn't labeled and dated. If any food has thawed partially and refrozen   say, during a power outage   it needs to go as well. Related: 16 Foods to Freeze for Later (and How to Do It Right) Expired Food Food is stamped with an expiration date for a reason. Even if it's still safe to eat, it's likely losing its taste and nutritional value. Reclaim pantry space by throwing it out. Condiment Packets These likely take up room in a drawer or on your counter while you have a larger version in the pantry or refrigerator. Why save them? Just use the big bottle you already have. 5-Day-Old Leftovers Leftovers vary in how long they stay good , but five days is the maximum amount of time you should really ever keep them. Anything older is likely going south and best thrown away. Old Spices Like other food items, spices carry an expiration date. Toss them if they are expired or if they've lost their smell or taste. Old Dish Sponges Dish sponges invite germs, bacteria, and mold to multiply right on your counter. Ideally, you should disinfect your dish sponge daily , throw it out weekly. Wine Bottles Old wine bottles, especially unusually colored ones, may seem worth saving for flowers or a craft project, but if you haven't gotten around to using them yet, chances are you won't. Coffee Mugs You Don't Use Think about how many separate cups of coffee or tea you actually drink in a day. Most likely that number is low, so why would you keep a dozen coffee mugs? Get rid of all but two or three favorites for each coffee drinker. Keep a few extra if you regularly have company. Kitchen Utensils Have a drawer full of unused kitchen utensils and excess cutlery? Time to clean it out. Throw away plastic utensils along with those condiment packets   again, why save them? You likely have plenty of real silverware, so use that. Get rid of any utensils that have been mangled by the dishwasher or garbage disposal, and those that are broken. Food Storage Containers Food storage containers are useless if they don't have a lid that fits. Ditto if they are stained, warped, or cracked. These are simple things to get rid of now without much thought. Baking Sheets Baking sheets that sport cooking spots or rust aren't worth keeping. Don't fall into the Pinterest trap of thinking you'll repurpose them as memo boards or chore charts. Chances are you won't. Takeout Menus A stack of takeout menus shouldn't take up prime kitchen real estate. These days, you can find menus online for just about any restaurant. The same goes for restaurant coupons. In fact, a quick search online might reveal even better coupons than the ones you've collected. Reusable Shopping Bags Take inventory of the reusable shopping bags you have. They seem to be given out at every event these days, and you really don't need more than three or four. That's plenty to cover a trip to the grocery store. Paper and Plastic Shopping Bags Sure, having a few paper or plastic bags handy for trash or messes is a good idea, but storing bags filled with bags just isn't. Check to see if your local grocer has a place to recycle bags or, if not, put them in your recycling bin. Broken Electronics Do you have a broken TV stored away in the hopes that one day you'll have time to fiddle around and fix it? Chances are you won't ever get around to it. Ditto for that laptop that stopped working last year. Device Cords Unlabeled, unrecognizable electronic-device cords are useless. Rather than take the time to figure out which items they fit, toss them. You must have been using the devices just fine without them, or with a different cord. If a discarded cord turns out to be necessary, getting a replacement shouldn't be too difficult or expensive. Movies It's definitely time to get rid of those old VHS tapes, if you haven't already. Who has a VCR anymore? At least DVDs and Blu-rays are still being made and sold   but with most movies and shows streaming and available for download, those discs won't be necessary for long. Start by discarding the movies you didn't like. Old Bills and Statements If a bill has been paid, hold onto it until you're sure payment was received. Beyond that, there usually isn't a reason to keep bills and statements. You can probably find all the old ones online if you need them. But use a shredder to destroy old bills instead of just tossing them   for security's sake. Instruction Manuals After initial setup, instruction manuals usually find their way into a random drawer never to be needed again. These days you can find just about any instruction manual online, or outlined in a YouTube video demo. Get rid of the paper versions today. Books Once they've been read, many books can be passed on to someone else to enjoy. Reserve valuable shelf space for absolute favorites   until they fall apart from rereading. Old Magazines Even more so than books, magazines and newspapers are unlikely to be reread. Toss them when you're done, instead of cluttering your space. Memorable articles can almost certainly be revisited online. Expired Coupons How many coupons do you have that are actually current? Make a habit of sorting through them every week or two to weed out those that are expired. Old Calendars While it might be hard to part with a calendar full of stunning photography, there's no point in keeping it. Ditto for old paper planners. Just make sure to shred any pages with personal information on them. Greeting Cards It's so nice to get a birthday or thank you card in the mail, but with rare exceptions, don't be sentimental: Once you've read it   and maybe, in the case of holiday cards, displayed it for a week or two   it's time to part ways. Receipts This is a tricky one, because you may need some receipts for taxes or other purposes. But more and more stores these days offer the option of an email receipt. And they can process a refund onto a credit or debit card without a paper receipt. If you do need a receipt for a warranty, you can snap a picture and save it in your phone. Filled Notebooks and Coloring Books You don't need to hang onto a notebook or coloring book once every page is full. If you jotted down important information at some point and no longer need it, just be sure to shred those pages. Old Toys In homes with kids, toys seem to be everywhere. Toss any that are broken or dirty beyond repair, and any toys that haven't been played with in the past three months. If there are batteries required and you still haven't replaced them, pass on the toy to someone willing to revive it. Expired Car Seats Car Seat Safety 101: Car seats expire . If a child's car seat has expired, been in a crash, or simply been outgrown, don't just shove it into storage. Cut the straps and put it on the curb   or find a trade-in event. Old Craft Supplies Paint, glue, markers, and the like dry out. Toss anything old that can't be used. Most people don't need a ton of crafting supplies. Consider paring down to just one tub of supplies and donating the rest to a local school. Musical Instruments No One Plays Did your kids try to learn the recorder or take up the violin for a year, only to leave the instrument gathering dust? If it's in decent condition, you can sell it to someone who will use it. Games With Missing Pieces If that old game taking up space doesn't get played anymore because it's missing pieces, toss it. Ditto for that incomplete deck of cards sitting in a drawer. Extra Vases Vases are one of those things you tend to accumulate without realizing it. Whenever flowers get delivered, they typically come in a vase. It's time to get rid of all but one or two favorites unless you make a habit of displaying fresh flowers in every room. Office Supplies Clear out pens that are out of ink, memo pads you don't use, file folders that no longer hold anything, labels that aren't the right size, and any other office supplies that sit dormant. Kids' Schoolwork If you have school-age kids, you know the amount of paper that comes home. It sometimes feels like you should save every worksheet and piece of art, but you don't need to. Snap pictures and save digital copies of your favorite drawings and school papers instead of letting the originals pile up.

And what are you prepared to bring to the relationship? It's good to meditate on this. Your career horoscope The pursuit of professional interests might temporarily interfere with your social life, and this might cause just a little friction between you and a close friend or romantic partner. Your friend, however, is more apt to want to brood than to discuss it with you. Don't panic! This person will come out of their funk and be more understanding. Explain the situation to them as best as you can, then continue with your work. Your finance horoscope Some pretty heavy soul-searching could reveal to you that the time has come to make use of a talent which you may have always had but never developed. This could involve nothing more than a little practice, or you could decide to go in for some formal training in the matter. This is a positive sign, but your determination might waver over the next few days. Don't hesitate - stay with it! Your wellbeing horoscope Today is a day to stand up and take action. Forces may be pulling on you from all angles and your challenge today will be to maintain a healthy balance between all of them. You have the opportunity of accomplishing quite a bit by directing your energies outward instead of inward. Other people may be snappy and punchy. Counteract this by being patient and well mannered. Your contribution to the group will be greatly appreciated. Tomorrow's horoscope Sometimes you can be oversensitive to other people's opinions. Today you might sense that someone in your entourage has a different view than yours. They could be a little aloof toward you, and you could feel intimidated by their attitude. Stand up for yourself and be confident! Your talents might threaten this person. Some people tend to be critical when they feel that you are competing with them. Rise above their negative attitude.

BBMJwbb	movies	movienews	The 25 Best High School Movies Ever To Relive the Glory (or Nightmare) Days	Parties, hormones, teachers, and a whole lot of nostalgia.	Parties, hormones, teachers, and a whole lot of nostalgia. Love it or hate it, the high school years help shape us into the people we are today. And with all the hormones, the trouble-making, the misplaced sense of entitlement, the confusion, and sexual exploration movies about high school make for pretty damn good entertainment. Whether they bring back nightmares or the best times of our lives, there's no denying that a good movie about those formidable years is something to which almost all of us can relate. Regardless of where you stood in your lunch table ecosystem, let's take some time reminisce on that analog feel of first kisses, pep rallies, and simpler problems that seemed so big at the time. Take a walk down memory lane with these classic teen flicks. The Edge of Seventeen Hailee Steinfeld channels a new-age Molly Ringwald in this sharp spin on the classic teenaged dramedy. The film is as radically honest as it is quick-witted, following high school junior Nadine's self-aware quest to endure the awkwardness of her salad days. Not to mention, it doesn't hurt that her teacher mentor is played by Woody Harrelson. Netflix Shop Now See the original post on Youtube Dead Poets Society Robin Williams stars as John Keating, an English teacher at an elite all-boys boarding school, who is determined to encourage his students to break the mold of their regimented education through poetry. The cinematic "seize the day" manifesto is a celebration of the late-Williams's ability to communicate the wise and the worldly in the most offbeat of characters. Shop Now Shop Now See the original post on Youtube Lady Bird Ah, the first documented instance of the natural phenomenon that is Greta Gerwig directing Saiorse Ronan. This semi-autobiographical film stars Ronan as Christine "Lady Bird" McPherson, a pink-haired firecracker who is trapped within the monotonous confines of her Catholic school adolescence in Sacramento, California. The heartwarming flick features outstanding performances from Laurie Metcalf, Timothée Chalamet, Lucas Hedges, and Beanie Feldstein. Shop Now Google See the original post on Youtube Perks of Being a Wallflower If an angsty indie anthem were a film, it would be Perks of Being a Wallflower. Logan Lerman stars as a doe-eyed high school freshman whose fate takes a twist when two boldly offbeat seniors, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller, take him under their wing. From kisses in twinkly-light-draped bedrooms, to dancing on the bed of trucks in traffic tunnels, this coming-of-age is something out of a Tumblr teen's dreams. Shop Now Shop Now See the original post on Youtube Booksmart Olivia Wilde's feature directorial debut Booksmart has been frequently referred to as "Superbad for girls," and it's not just because it stars Jonah Hill's little sister. The instant coming-of-age classic follows two academic overachievers, played by Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, as they embark on their final night of high school with one assignment: to cram in all of the fun they missed over the last four years while they played by the rules. Shop Now Shop Now See the original post on Youtube Superbad Shop Now Shop Now Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg wrote the perfect contemporary teen sex comedy which follows, naturally, two teenage boys who vow to lose their virginity before graduation. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera play fictional versions of the screenwriters (with Rogen appearing in the film as a bumbling cop), while Emma Stone delivers a star-making turn as Hill's love interest. Carrie Shop Now Shop Now High school is literally hell in Brian De Palma's adaptation of Stephen King's debut novel. Sissy Spacek earned her first Oscar nomination for this horror film, playing the outcast Carrie White who is abused by her evangelical mother and bullied by her mean classmates. But she eventually has her revenge when she uses her telekinetic powers against her enemies. Bring It On Shop Now Shop Now One of the best high school sports movies is undoubtedly this cheerleading-focused comedy, which stars Kirsten Dunst as the head of a troupe who learns that their former captain stole their routines from an inner-city Los Angeles squad. Sixteen Candles Shop Now Shop Now Molly Ringwald stars in this John Hughes-directed classic as a misfit teen whose 16th birthday is completely ruined when her parents overlook her in favor of her sister's upcoming wedding. Add to that an endless string of humiliations, from bullying classmates to a insufferably horny geek who won't leave her alone. Cooley High Set in mid-'60s Chicago, Cooley High follows a group of friends who are celebrating the end of the school year an exciting time that is put to a halt when two of the group are falsely accused of stealing a car. Fame Shop Now Shop Now Four students enter a prestigious high school in New York City dedicated to the performing arts. All of them are tested throughout the school year to express themselves and try to fit into the rigorous world of theater as they discover their own individual identities as young adults. Grease Shop Now Shop Now The classic musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is a crowd-pleasing nostalgia fest for the blissfully innocent 1950s. The duo play an unlikely romantic pair the greaser Danny Zuko and the virginal Sandy whose classmates scheme to keep them from finding true love together. American Graffiti Shop Now Shop Now Years before Star Wars , George Lucas wrote and directed this Oscar-nominated ensemble comedy about a group of high school graduates who spend one last night together in 1962 cruising around and reflecting on their future. The inspiration for the long-running series Happy Days , the all-star cast includes Ron Howard and launched the careers of Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Mackenzie Phillips, and Suzanne Somers. The Last Picture Show Shop Now Shop Now Nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture (and winning two for Best Supporting Actor and Actress), Peter Bogdanovich's stark adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel remains one of the most realistic and somber reflections of teenage life. Set in a small north Texas town that's on the brink of ruin, the film stars Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, and Cybil Shepard as high school seniors who must reckon with their dying hometown and the paths their futures have in store for them. Heathers Shop Now Shop Now This disarmingly dark comedy remains one of the ballsiest teen movies ever made. Winona Ryder stars as the whip-smart Veronica Sawyer, a popular girl who hates her best friends (a trio of queen bees, all named Heather). Her life spins out of control when she falls for the new kid at school the trench coat-wearing, gun-toting J.D., played by Christian Slater who convinces her to kill off her clique Rebel Without a Cause Shop Now Shop Now Nicolas Ray's searing drama essentially invented the American teenager and teenage angst and made a Hollywood icon out of its star, James Dean. Dean plays a Los Angeles teenager who rebels against his strict parents and becomes friends with the lonely Plato (Sal Mineo) and the defiant Judy (Natalie Wood) Hoop Dreams Shop Now Shop Now The high school sports movie  Hoosiers , Remember the Titans , Varsity Blues  is a film staple, but none have the heart and soul of Steve James's stirring documentary about two teenagers from Chicago who are recruited by a scout to attend a privileged (and predominantly white) suburban high school to participate in its basketball program. Mean Girls Shop Now Shop Now Tina Fey's sole screenplay is based on the sociological study Queen Bees and Wannabes , which she ingeniously turned into a hilarious comedy that stars Lindsay Lohan as new girl Cady who is tapped by her high school's reigning popular girls to join their clique. As she attempts to dismantle their power, she only becomes more ruthless and mean herself. To Sir, With Love Shop Now Shop Now Sidney Poitier stars in this iconic film, one that inspired countless imitations, as an American teacher in an inner-city London high school who shepherds his class of unruly, disrespectful pupils and inspires them to embrace their education and personal responsibility. Ferris Bueller's Day Off Shop Now Shop Now Undoubtedly the best high school movie that doesn't even take place in high school, this John Hughes comedy stars Matthew Broderick in the role that made him a star. The titular character skips out of school for a day with his girlfriend and best friend, which sees the trio embarking on a madcap tour of Chicago while the school principal and Ferris's surly sister are hellbent on catching him playing hooky. Clueless Shop Now Shop Now Amy Heckerling wrote and directed this brilliant teen comedy, inspired by Jane Austen's Emma , which stars Alicia Silverstone in her most iconic performance as a ditzy, if well-meaning, Beverly Hills high school student who weaves a complicated matchmaking web learning that it's ultimately better to be selfless than selfish. Election Shop Now Shop Now Reese Witherspoon delivers her best performance in Alexander Payne's dark comedy, playing the ambitious Tracy Flick, who is eager to become student body president. Matthew Broderick sheds his youthful charm to play the social studies teacher who will stop at nothing to stop the teenage girl from achieving her goal a scheme that throws the all-American high school into turmoil. Fast Times at Ridgemont High Shop Now Shop Now This film marked the directorial debut of Amy Heckerling and the screenwriting debut of Cameron Crowe. Based on the latter's undercover reportage at a San Diego high school, Fast Times at Ridgemont High explores the ins and outs of teen sexuality in comically honest fashion. The film also launched the careers of Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nicolas Cage, Phoebe Cates, Eric Stoltz, Forest Whitaker, Anthony Edwards, and Judge Reinhold. Dazed and Confused Shop Now Shop Now Richard Linklater's comedy follows the American Graffiti framework, examining the various social circles of the rising freshman and senior classes of an Austin, Texas high school on its last day in 1976. Like other great teen ensemble films, it marked early appearances from greats like Matthew McConaughey, Parker Posey, Milla Jovovich, and Ben Affleck. The Breakfast Club Shop Now Shop Now Five high school students from varying social classes a brain (Anthony Michael Hall), an athlete (Emilio Estevez), a basket case (Ally Sheedy), a princess (Molly Ringwald), and a criminal (Judd Nelson) spend a fateful Saturday detention together in John Hughes's classic teen drama. Together, the five students learn they have much more in common than they thought.
AAApGWa	health	wellness	You Guys, the Science Behind Weighted Blankets Is Actually Fascinating	If you've wondered if these bead- or pellet-filled wonders live up to the hype, you're not alone. There's actually quite a bit of science behind why they work.	You can't scroll through Instagram without seeing someone curled up under a weighted blanket . If you've wondered if these bead- or pellet-filled wonders live up to the hype, you're not alone - but there's actually quite a bit of science behind why they work, especially for people with anxiety (or just a lot of roommate drama). A weighted blanket is exactly what it sounds like: a heavy blanket with evenly distributed weight throughout that essentially cocoons you while you're using it. Its benefits are twofold. The blanket both hugs your body and grounds you, and each of these actions affects hormone levels, easing your anxiety. Consider the hug first. Hugs naturally make people feel better because they release oxytocin , a hormone that helps bring your blood pressure down, slows your heart, and makes you feel relaxed. The simulated hug can also release serotonin, a hormone that decreases stress. Weighted blankets also keep you grounded, and according to a study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine , grounding the body - or weighing it down - regulates the secretion of cortisol during sleep. Cortisol is a stress hormone that flares when you're anxious. If you're considering a weighted blanket, look for one that's 10 percent of your bodyweight , and make sure to read the product descriptions carefully before choosing. If at any point your anxiety starts to disrupt your life, talk to a doctor or therapist . Video: Not-so-obvious reasons you're waking up in the middle of the night (Provided by Buzz60)
BBVFn5b	health	nutrition	The Unhealthiest Fast Food Burgers Ranked!	Beware: These burgers are the biggest offenders when it comes to calories, fat, and sodium.	Beware: These burgers are the biggest offenders when it comes to calories, fat, and sodium. The Unhealthiest Fast Food Burgers Ranked! Fast food has a bad reputation in the health world for a number of reasons. These foods are notorious for containing far too many calories and a hefty amount of unhealthy fat and sodium, in addition to a long list of additives and preservatives that are often hard to even pronounce, let alone things you'd want to eat and put in your body. One of the most popular fast food items is hands-down the burger and there are a lot of variations of this menu item. Not only are they notorious on the menus of America's top restaurant chains (which we already rounded up for you ), but they're also readily available at all your go-to fast-food restaurants, too. We decided to figure out which ones are the worst for your health at these quick-service places, too. Here's how we determined our list: Methodology: In order to identify the unhealthiest fast food burgers in America, we compiled a list of the most caloric burgers from 17 of the most popular fast food restaurants nationwide. The burgers with the most calories, in most cases, also have the highest total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium contents as well. To break ties, we chose the burger with a greater amount of sodium and deemed that one less healthy. We also only considered the top three most unhealthy burgers at each restaurant to ensure we represented a diverse range of restaurants on this list. We also only considered fast food restaurants that provided all the nutritional information. No sides were considered in this ranking either. Every burger on this list has at least 1,000 calories. Now, here are the 15 unhealthiest fast food restaurant burgers in the country, ranked from the least unhealthy to the absolute worst of the worst. Notice that a lot of the burgers on this list either contain three beef patties or include several slices of bacon . For some, they contain both. And once you're done reading this list, make sure you check out The 100 Unhealthiest Foods on the Planet for more! 15. Culver's Mushroom & Swiss ButterBurger (Triple) Nutrition: 1,060 calories, 69 g fat (28 g saturated fat, 2.1 g trans fat), 968 mg sodium, 44 g carbs (2 g fiber, 6 g sugar), 68 g protein This triple patty stacker is packing in calories and fat, which makes it one of the least healthy fast food burgers out there. White button mushrooms that are sautéed in butter and seasoned with pepper, parsley, garlic, and salt sit between three beef patties. And if there wasn t enough butter on the mushrooms already, there s even more coating the bun. For some, this burger contains an entire day s worth of protein at nearly 70 grams. 14. Carl's Jr. 1/2 lb. Bacon Truffle Angus Burger Nutrition: 1,050 calories, 69 g fat (25 g saturated fat, 2.5 g trans fat), 2,150 mg sodium, 54 g carbs (2 g fiber, 10 g sugar), 54 g protein Notice that this burger has about 10 calories less than Culver s Mushroom & Swiss ButterBurger, but what makes this burger an even less healthy option is that it packs 2,150 milligrams of sodium. That s nearly equivalent to the 2,300 milligrams of sodium one is recommended to consume at most in one day, according to the United States Department of Agriculture 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines . Applewood smoked bacon, fried onion strings, mayonnaise, and Swiss cheese all contribute to this burger s sky-high sodium count. 13. Whataburger's Chop House Cheddar Burger Nutrition: 1,080 calories, 67 g fat (25 g saturated fat, 2 g trans fat), 1,590 mg sodium, 60 g carbs (2 g fiber, 11 g sugar), 60 g protein What s in this Whataburger Chop House Cheddar Burger? Bacon, beef, a lot of cheese, and cheese sauce. It makes sense why this burger is loaded in saturated fat. Interestingly, the burger also packs 11 grams of added sugar. For context, two Twisted Strawberry Blast Twizzlers contain the same amount of added sugar. The American Heart Association suggests that women consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar a day and that men consume no more than 36 grams. So if you re a woman, this burger cancels out half of your daily allowance of added sugar and regardless of gender calories. 12. Whataburger's Mushroom Swiss Burger Nutrition: 1,080 calories, 69 g fat (23 g saturated fat, 2 g trans fat), 1,780 mg sodium, 59 g carbs (2 g fiber, 11 g sugar), 55 g protein Another mushroom Swiss burger makes the unhealthiest fast food burgers list. Whataburger s version of the tasty burger is slightly less healthy than Culver s, and this is because of its higher calorie and sodium content. In fact, this burger packs about twice as much sodium as Culver s burger does, which had 968 milligrams. 11. Culver's Bacon Deluxe (Triple) Nutrition: 1,090 calories, 76 g fat (29.5 g saturated fat, 2.1 g trans fat), 1,430 mg sodium, 42 g carbs (1 g fiber, 10 g sugar), 60 g protein As if the Culver s Deluxe sandwich wasn t already a triple whammy with three beef patties, the bacon version is even more so, with a few slices of bacon sandwiched between the bun, too. With 76 grams of total fat, this sandwich has as much fat as 15 tablespoons of plain cream cheese. 10. Whataburger's Monterey Melt Nutrition: 1,110 calories, 71 g fat (24 g saturated fat, 2 g trans fat), 2,510 mg sodium, 62 g carbs (4 g fiber, 12 g sugar), 54 g protein The Monterey Melt at Whataburger has as many calories as 10 slices of Swiss cheese (28 grams each). Another alarming thing about this burger is its sodium content at a staggering 2,510 milligrams, which is well over the maximum suggested amount of 2,300 milligrams. To compare, if you devoured 10 slices of Swiss, you d consume about 520 milligrams of sodium. 9. McDonald's Double Bacon Smokehouse Burger Nutrition: 1,130 calories, 67 g fat (27 g saturated fat, 3 g trans fat), 1,920 mg sodium, 64 g carbs (3 g fiber, 18 g sugar), 70 g protein The Double Bacon Smokehouse Burger is the only burger from McDonald s to make this list. Anyone else shocked? For many years, the Big Mac was thought to be the restaurant chain s most caloric offender, but it actually contains less than half of the calories and fat than the Double Bacon Smokehouse burger. 8. Wendy's Barbecue Cheeseburger Triple Nutrition: 1,150 calories, 73 g fat (30 g saturated fat, 4 g trans fat), 1,900 mg sodium, 57 g carbs (3 g fiber, 15 g sugar), 71 g protein BBQ sauce may give any dish a sweet and smoky boost, but at what cost? Not only is this burger from Wendy s chock-full of saturated fat, but it also packs about 15 grams of purely added sugar. You can have about 36 Reese s Pieces for the same amount of added sugar. 7. Burger King's Bacon King Nutrition: 1,150 calories, 79 g fat (31 g saturated fat, 3.5 g trans fat), 2,150 mg sodium, 49 g carbs (2 g fiber, 10 g sugar), 61 g protein Any burger called the Bacon King is bound to have a lot of calories, right? Not only is this BK burger loaded in calories, but it also contains a whopping 31 grams of saturated fat. For a healthier bacon-burger option, opt for the restaurant chain s bacon cheeseburger, which clocks in at 320 calories, 16 grams of total fat, 7 grams of saturated fat, and 710 milligrams of sodium. 6. Wendy's S'Awesome Bacon Cheeseburger Triple Nutrition: 1,170 calories, 78 g fat (32 g saturated fat, 4 g trans fat), 1,940 mg sodium, 43 g carbs (3 g fiber, 8 g sugar), 76 g protein This triple-decker sandwich from Wendy s has about as many calories as two of Dave s Single burgers, with one clocking in at 570 calories. Not to mention, one Dave s Single contains 13 grams of saturated fat, which is less than half of the amount of saturated fat that s in the S Awesome Bacon Cheeseburger. 5. Carl's Jr. The 1/2 lb. Guacamole Bacon Thickburger Nutrition: 1,200 calories, 89 g fat (30 g saturated fat, 3 g trans fat), 1,990 mg sodium, 51 g carbs (4 g fiber, 12 g sugar), 46 g protein Guacamole on a burger? It s no wonder this burger packs 1,200 calories and 89 grams of total fat! You might think the avocado contributes healthy fat to this meal, but when there s already half of a pound of beef coupled with bacon, there s really no need for additional fat. 4. Burger King's Rodeo King Nutrition: 1,250 calories, 82 g fat (31 g saturated fat, 3.5 g trans fat), 2,270 mg sodium, 69 g carbs (3 g fiber, 14 g sugar), 60 g protein Onion rings, beef, cheese, and bacon? Sounds a bit excessive to us. It s no surprise that with all of this extra salty sustenance, the sodium content of this burger is equal to that of how much you re supposed to consume (at most) in one day. If you really have a hankering for a burger, how about ordering the cheeseburger from BK, which only contains 280 calories, 13 grams of total fat, and 6 grams of saturated fat? You could also split a side of onion rings with a friend if you want those too and feel like splurging. 3. Wendy's Peppercorn Mushroom Melt (Triple) Nutrition: 1,290 calories, 86 g fat (33 g saturated fat, 4 g trans fat), 1,820 mg sodium, 50 g carbs (4 g fiber, 7 g sugar), 78 g protein Note, this image does not showcase the true triple patty sandwich (it s the single), but you get the picture. Just how much meat is on here? About 3/4 of a pound. Yikes, no wonder there s 78 grams of protein. A typical, bottled protein shake contains between 15 and 20 grams of protein, so eating this burger in one sitting is equivalent to drinking between three to five shakes. 2. Hardee's 2/3 lb. Monster Thickburger Nutrition: 1,300 calories, 90 g fat (33 g saturated fat, N/A trans fat), 3,140 mg sodium, 53 g carbs (2 g fiber, 13 g sugar), 76 g protein Two 1/3 pound beef patties comprise the majority of this burger s insides. Another four strips of bacon, three slices of cheese, and a swipe of mayonnaise all take this burger to a whopping 90 grams of total fat. If you order the 1/2 pound cheeseburger from Hardee s, you get half of the calories (640) and about one-third of total fat (33 grams). 1. Burger King's Triple Stacker King Nutrition: 1,370 calories, 93 g fat (40 g saturated fat, 5 g trans fat), 2,300 mg sodium, 51 g carbs (2 g fiber, 11 g sugar), 85 g protein Finally, the unhealthiest fast food burger of them all: Burger King's Triple Stacker King. This burger costs you about two-thirds of your daily allotment of calories, about two days worth of saturated fat , and a day's worth of sodium. Did you ever think that three of Burger King's burgers would make the unhealthiest fast food burgers list? And sorry to disappoint, but the meals you can order from McDonald's aren't any better …

BBLjMHu	lifestyle	lifestylewhatshot	More women under 40 are going grey. Here's the surprising reason why	More women under 40 are going grey. Here's the surprising reason why.	Grey hair is something of a beauty phenomenon. Once hated by many as the ultimate, tell-tell sign of ageing, has now become a fashionable hair colour in its own right. Thanks to Instagram stars and bloggers, the trend took off and saw young women opting to dye their own hair into soft white and grey hues. #Greyhair has over 1.5 million hashtags on Instagram and the latest hashtag that seems to be taking off is #Grombre, a handle dedicated to mature women who want to show off their natural grey roots. Salt and pepper, silver, pewter, charcoal; at some point in your life you will go grey but research conducted by colour experts John Frieda states that 32 per cent of British women under the age of 30 have already started to go grey. In the past, your first grey-hair day may have arrived in your forties but nowadays some women are losing their natural colour as early as their twenties. Thankfully women are starting to embrace their grey roots; Mintel data research revealed that 68 percent of 25-64 year olds think 'it is acceptable to have grey hair'. What causes your hair to go grey? "Hair goes grey when your colour-producing cells stop making pigment, other wise known as melanin," says hairstylist and owner of Neville Hair & Beauty, Neville Tucker. Going grey can also be caused by a build up of naturally occurring hydrogen peroxide, that when left untreated, can cause a bleaching effect. As a general consensus, Caucasians start going grey by early thirties, Asian hair in their late thirties and African by mid-forties. The new reason? Unhealthy hair Common reasons for going grey are age, a deficiency in vitamin B12 and sometimes a thyroid imbalance. However more recently it has been suggested that it could be caused by women having 'unhealthy hair'. "Due to the over-use of hair tools, styling products and environmental factors like pollution, our hair is less healthy than it used to be," says hairstylist and Hair Rituel Ambassador, Miguel Perez. "Like your skin, your scalp will age as you get older, so it's important to look after it with the right products and care," advises Perez. Think about it, if you don't look after your skin the probability of spots, wrinkles and other skincare woes is higher. It's the same with your hair. It has already been debated whether washing your hair with 'styling' shampoos (that deposit product on your scalp), could result in thinning hair. Hair trauma is something highly associated with hair-thinning but also now with colour and specifically, greying. "If you colour your hair from a young age, you are essentially 'traumatising' you hair regularly which causes a shock effect on your hair that forces hair follicles to break," advises Perez. "When follicles break the new hairs that grow back may appear whiter as they haven't been nurtured enough with keratin," says Perez. "Other hair traumas that may have an affect on the rate at which you go grey are pollution, styling tools, stress and health". Unfortunately hair products are often not made with the same science as skincare, but in the meantime, here are four ways to avoid grey hair and the best at-home tools to enhance your grey hair. 4 ways to avoid grey hair Stop smoking. "According to studies, smokers are four times more likely to have grey hair than non-smokers," says Tucker. "Smoking is conclusively linked to oxidative stress caused by the free radicals or reactive oxygen species nicotine releases." Take a vitamin B12 supplement. L ow B12 levels force melanin pigment to stop producing coloured follicles. Treat your hair to a mask or serum. Adopting a weekly regime of treating your hair to a mask or serum will help keep lengths in a good, healthy condition. Don't wear your hair up. If you keep your hair in a knot everyday you will break it which causes trauma to the scalp and can increase your risk of grey hairs.
BBJ963r	autos	autosreview	2018 Hyundai Sonata 2.4L	2018 Hyundai Sonata 2.4L	Styling is the decisive factor in many perhaps even most vehicle purchases, particularly among coupes and sedans. Which makes Hyundai's conservative 2015 redesign of its Sonata family sedan all the more mystifying. Hyundai called the new look "more mature." We assessed it at the time, kindly, as "less dramatic." Drama Revived Critical response to the Sonata's styling retreat did not go unnoticed at Hyundai. That brings us to the 2018 Sonata tested here, rescued from its "more mature" anonymity by a less inhibited facelift. Although the revisions also extend to the rear new LED taillights, a redesigned bumper, and a new trunklid with an enlarged Hyundai logo the real attention grabber is Hyundai's big new hexagonal grille, flanked by LED daytime running lights set in deep housings that look as though they could be air scoops for a set of racy carbon-ceramic brakes. (Bulletin: Carbon ceramics are not on the Sonata's options list.) That large central maw Hyundai calls it the "cascading grille" suggests there might be some potent source of propulsion behind it that requires mass quantities of air for optimal operation. The Sonata's let-me-at-'em look may lure prospects into showrooms, but what they'll find under the reshaped hood doesn't measure up to the suggestion of the exterior. All of the Sonata's powertrain offerings there are five if you count both the hybrid and plug-in-hybrid models carry over from 2017, and even the most potent is no match for the top engines available in the new Honda Accord or the latest Toyota Camry, the perennial mid-size-sedan pacesetters. That includes the 2.4-liter inline-four in our test subject, an example of the new-for-2018 SEL trim level. It's positioned above the base SE and Eco models, the latter being the only one to employ a turbocharged 1.6-liter. Above the SEL, you'll find a bifurcated path to Sport and Limited trims, each of which is offered with a turbocharged 2.0-liter that appends 2.0T to the model name and puts 245 horsepower to the front wheels through a new eight-speed automatic. The naturally aspirated 2.4-liter we tested, by contrast, has been the Sonata's standard engine since 2011, and it makes 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. This direct-injected four pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission; a manual shifting mode is available via the shift lever (there are no paddles), but it doesn't seem to affect performance one way or another. There is no manual-transmission option. The 2.4 propels the 2018 Sonata with a smidge more vigor than it did in a 2015 Sonata we tested this 2018 SEL was a half-second quicker to 60 mph and a wink or two ahead at every other data point, even though curb weights are roughly equal. Okay, Okay, Okay All of this adds up to "okay" marks on the great mid-size-sedan scorecard, and the same goes for the new Sonata's dynamics. The consensus of the product planners was that the Sonata's chassis needed no attention, so the only revision to the suspension is heftier rear control arms. The ride and handling rate as fine, without rising to exceptional. Cornering responses aren't as decisive as those of the latest Accord, and if the new control arms add anything to the character it's essentially subliminal. Cornering grip of 0.85 g on our skidpad trails the Accord 1.5T's 0.89 g and the Camry SE 2.5L's 0.88 g. Braking from 70 mph to a stop in 167 feet also stacks up as okay, better than the Toyota's 175 feet but longer than the Honda's 163-foot stop. Steering is a notch or two more tactile than many but unlikely to be perceived as sporty. (As in almost all contemporary sedans, the Sonata's is an electrically assisted rack-and-pinion system.) Here, too, the Sonata earns a passing grade by being unremarkable. The Sonata's dynamic forte is ride quality that's compliant without excessive rock and roll, fortified by quiet operation at freeway speeds. Okay Plus Where the 2018 Sonata goes beyond okay is inside its cabin. Materials have a high-quality look and feel, the new instrument cluster is attractively legible, and the redesigned center stack will delight those who prefer secondary controls of the physical variety, offering plenty of buttons (18) and knobs (4). There are no operating mysteries here, no poking at a touchscreen whilst rumbling over a stretch of nasty pavement. And, typical of Hyundai, the Sonata's value is higher than that of most of its competitors, with plenty of standard features even at the basic SE trim level. A 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, automatic headlights, and a blind-spot monitoring system are standard on all trim levels. In the SEL trim (a $1650 step up from the SE) there's a standard proximity key and push-button start, a power driver's seat, heated front seats, and a USB port for the rear passenger compartment. The SEL is the lowest trim level that offers the $1000 Tech package that came on our test car, which includes automated emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. Besides $125 for carpeted floor mats, the Tech package was the only option, which means this Sonata packed a lot of high-demand content under a $25,710 sticker. Only in the top-level Limited 2.0T does the price cross the $30K frontier before options. If the turbo's power isn't terribly important to you, though, many of the Limited's luxuries are available in other Sonatas for considerably less. The 2018 Sonata packages competent performance in eye-catching new clothing. Considering the content at the price, it's a good deal for a pleasant, well-equipped, and nonintrusive motoring experience. And we're okay with that.

AAAO4pd	health	mentalhealth	Physical symptoms of anxiety no one talks about	Anxiety isn't something that just happens in your head. Anxiety is a mental health condition experienced on both a mental and physiological level.	Anxiety isn't something that just happens in your head. Anxiety is a mental health condition experienced on both a mental and physiological level. Physical Symptoms of Anxiety No One Talks About Contrary to what some may believe, anxiety isn't something that just happens in your head. Anxiety refers to a very real mental health condition   and for many, it is experienced on both a mental and physiological level. The term "anxiety" is often used flippantly, but in reality anxiety is a condition that should be diagnosed by a mental health professional. There's a big difference between feeling the effects of an anxiety disorder and feeling occasional stress. Stress is often in reaction to a life change or other trigger; symptoms of anxiety sometimes develop in response to those things, but can also occur at random. Some of the symptoms of anxiety are more well-known   especially the ones related to thoughts and emotions. It is not uncommon, for instance, for a person with anxiety to worry excessively or experience irritability and mood swings. However, some symptoms of anxiety are more physical. Click through the slideshow above for some you may not know about. Dizziness The dizziness that can come with anxiety is actually physical   it's not all in this person's imagination. The vestibular system, comprised of your inner ear and specific areas of the brain, is responsible for your sense of balance. Researchers believe that parts of the brain related to anxiety somehow are related to the areas of the brain that keep you feeling spatially balanced. As a result, many people will experience sudden onsets of dizziness in tandem with anxiety . Restlessness You might not think of feeling restless as a physical symptom, but for those with anxiety it can feel out of their control. Restlessness is characterized by an energetic feeling in the limbs that causes an uncontrollable urge to move. This can end up causing symptoms such as tapping your feet, shaking your leg, or finding another outlet for the influx of energy. You may have heard of restless leg syndrome   this is a specific and common example of restlessness that's difficult to control. Muscle tension Having tense muscles can happen for a number of reasons, but for people with anxiety it can become fairly common. It's unclear why there is a connection, but tensing muscles under stress may become more chronic for someone living with anxiety. The chronic tension can wear and tear on muscle systems resulting in back pain or other ailments. Increased heart rate Anxiety can sometimes trigger a "fight or flight" response in the body, which triggers certain stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones create a physiological reaction. Part of this reaction is an increase in heart rate and constriction of blood vessels. The reason for this reaction is to increase the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the muscles, in case they need to work harder in response to a threat. However, it is rare that there is an imminent physical threat when a person is experiencing anxiety. A person's heart rate may spike while they are sitting at work, for instance, and it can take some time for it to slow back down. Feeling too hot or too cold Due to the altered circulation that can come with anxiety, hot flashes are not uncommon. Narrowing blood vessels can affect body temperature. A person may, for this reason, feel too hot when they are anxious. Conversely, sometimes the body will sweat in response. This can sometimes be too effective and cause a person to feel too cold . Rapid breathing Some will experience changes in breathing patterns when dealing with anxiety. This can be characterized by short, shallow breaths. When this begins to happen, people will often try to breathe deeply to get enough oxygen, since they are concerned they are not getting enough. However, that can worsen the situation. The problem isn't too little oxygen, it's too much. The "fight or flight" response can trigger these changes in breath as a mechanism for getting more oxygen in the body to deliver to supply to the heart. The short breaths can quickly worsen and turn into hyperventilation. There are some breathing and relaxation techniques that may work to return breathing back to normal before it spirals out of control. Sweating Many experience this symptom as "nervous sweating." Sweating in response to anxiety is completely normal; it's a reaction to the circulation changes discussed earlier. When your heart rate speeds up and your blood vessels constrict, it can cause your body temperature to rise. In an attempt to cool down, your body may start to sweat   regardless of the temperature of your surrounding environment. This can also happen in people who do not have an anxiety disorder under periods of stress. Trembling When you feel fear, you might shake. For someone with anxiety, the body perceives fear even when there is no real or imminent threat. This can cause someone with anxiety to tremble or shake often. The "fight or flight" response to anxiety or stress sends messages to your brain to prepare your muscles for action. When primed to act, your muscles may twitch or shake, appearing as a tremor. Chest pain Many people are aware that chest pain can occur due to a heart attack or acid reflux . But you may not know that anxiety is also a common cause of chest pain. Some studies suggest that as many as one in every four patients concerned about chest pain are actually experiencing an anxiety disorder. This can be due to anxiety putting pressure on the heart to work more efficiently or because of anxiety's interference in other systems. Hyperventilation and contractions in the esophagus can both cause the symptom. Chest pain from anxiety can set in quickly and is sometimes described as a sharp, stabbing feeling. Unlike chest pain that comes from cardiovascular distress , which typically occurs when a person is active, anxiety-related chest pain often occurs when a person is at rest. For those experiencing chest pains from anxiety, the symptom usually disappears in a short period of time  around 10 minutes. Fatigue Because anxiety can feel so high-energy, some may be surprised that a physical symptom tends to be fatigue . But it's in part because of all the energy that is expended on restlessness, muscle tension and racing thoughts that anxiety can cause severe fatigue. Some people experience fatigue after episodes of panic attacks or other incidents, while others have fatigue that is more chronic. Insomnia and other mental health disorders often associated with anxiety, such as depression, may also play a role. Muscle weakness Muscle weakness is sometimes a symptom of anxiety, though it doesn't occur for everyone. This symptom can show up as a sudden feeling of muscle fatigue, tingling or lack of confidence in muscles to work properly. It can be extremely distressing and make existing anxiety even worse , as some even perceive it as a lack of trust in their own body to support them throughout the day. Muscle weakness is often temporary, and while the direct cause is unknown, there are a few theories. Hyperventilation and the "fight or flight" response can both alter the amounts of oxygen being delivered to your muscles, resulting in sudden weakness or tingling. Constant strain on muscles from muscle tension can also result in fatigue. And for some, it may be a pure consequence of feeling more sensitive than usual to sensations in the body. A person with anxiety may perceive muscle weakness to be more dangerous or extreme than it really is. Gastrointestinal issues When your body is in "fight or flight" mode, it starts to shut down certain processes that it deems nonessential in order to preserve energy in case it's needed elsewhere. As a result, less energy is put towards digesting food. Adrenaline, one of the stress hormones released, also tends to relax the stomach muscles. As a result, a person with anxiety may experience digestive distress more often than the average person. Those with anxiety can experience stomach pain, lack of appetite, nausea, or diarrhea. Some studies even suggest that people with anxiety are more likely to experience irritable bowel syndrome. Sleep disruption The interaction between sleep and anxiety goes both ways: anxiety disrupts sleep and sleep upsets anxiety. The result creates a spiraling path toward mental and physical distress . For people with anxiety, insomnia is common. A person with anxiety may have trouble falling or staying asleep due to racing thoughts and other sources of distress. Attempting to incorporate a calming bedtime routine can sometimes help a person with anxiety to practice better sleep patterns, though there is no one cure that works for everyone. It's worth dedicating some trial and error, though. Here are all the incredible things that happen to your body when you do get the sleep you need . The Most Silent Killers and How to Avoid Them
BBJ3fVO	health	medical	How to Avoid a Dangerous Flu Complication	Pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs caused by an infection, is a common flu complication that can result in hospitalization and even death.	Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site. More than one out of every 10 deaths in the U.S. during the third week of 2018 was from influenza or pneumonia , according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs caused by an infection, is a common flu complication that can result in hospitalization and even death. CDC acting director Anne Schuchat, M.D., said in a media briefing on Feb. 9 that with flu-related hospitalization rates approaching record numbers, flu and pneumonia deaths are expected to continue to rise over the next few weeks. How Flu Leads to Pneumonia Flu can cause pneumonia in two ways. First, the influenza virus itself can infect the lungs, causing what's called viral pneumonia . Second, flu weakens the immune system and damages the lining of the respiratory tract, which can make it easier for certain bacteria to infect the lungs and cause bacterial pneumonia. Experts aren't sure exactly what percentage of people who get flu will go on to develop pneumonia, partly because the symptoms of the two can be similar, and there isn't a definitive lab test for pneumonia. Estimates of the number of flu patients who also develop a bacterial infection, for example, range from as low as 2 percent to as high as 65 percent, according to one analysis. But the people most at risk for a serious complication from flu include young children, pregnant women , and older adults, whose immune systems tend to be weaker, as well as people with certain underlying health conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease , blood disorders (such as sickle cell anemia), diabetes, immune-suppressing diseases (such as HIV), or conditions like cancer that require immunosuppressive drugs. Here, the steps to prevent and diagnose pneumonia. Get a Flu Shot The best way to protect against flu-related pneumonia is to avoid the flu itself. The CDC is still recommending people get a flu shot if they haven't already , "even this late in the season," Schuchat says. Although the vaccine doesn't perfectly protect against flu, it does reduce your chances of catching the illness. Also, evidence suggests that even if you get the flu, the shot may lessen the severity of the illness. That, in turn, means you have a smaller chance of developing a secondary bacterial infection, says Todd Rice, M.D., medical director of the medical ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Consider a Pneumococcal Vaccination Pneumococcal bacteria, which cause some cases of sepsis and meningitis as well as pneumonia, may be responsible for about a third of bacterial infections related to flu. There are currently two vaccines that are recommended for some high-risk groups as protection against all kinds of pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia. The first, Prevnar 13, protects against 13 different strains of the bacteria, while the second, Pneumovax 23, protects against 23 strains (there's some overlap between the shots). Healthy adults under 65 probably don't need them, however, because they're not at a high risk for pneumococcal disease. Here's who does need a pneumococcal vaccine, according to CDC guidelines: Children under 2 receive Prevnar as part of their regular vaccination schedule, something that started back in 2000. They should get a dose at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months old. Adults 65 and older should receive one dose each of Prevnar and Pneumovax, one year apart. The CDC recommends getting Prevnar first, as soon as you turn 65. (If you got Pneumovax first, wait a year and get Prevnar.) If you didn't get it when you turned 65, ask your doctor whether you can get the shot now; there's no upper age limit for receiving either vaccine. People with underlying health conditions who are between the ages of 2 and 64 should consult their doctor about which vaccines they should receive and when. Recommendations vary depending on your age and disease, but people who are more vulnerable to a flu complication because of a pre-existing health problem may benefit from the added protection of the vaccine. Note, however, that these vaccines aren't perfect, says Elaine Tuomanen, M.D., pediatric infectious disease specialist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital who studies pneumococcal vaccines. There are almost 100 different known strains of pneumococcal bacteria many more than are included in the vaccines. But it's still important for vulnerable people to receive them, to reduce their chances of serious illness. Reduce Your Exposure to Bacteria It's a good idea to stay home if you have the flu so that you avoid spreading the infection to others. But staying home until you feel well again can also help you protect against pneumonia, Tuomanen says. That's because the more you're out and about in the community, the greater the odds that you'll expose yourself to pneumococcal bacteria by getting it on your hands and touching your face. Exposure to this pathogen when your immune system is already weakened by flu can make it easier for a bacterial infection to take hold. And though you should always be diligent about washing your hands , this is why it's especially important to wash them frequently when you're recovering from the flu. Because of the damage it causes to your lungs, smoking cigarettes can also make you more likely to develop pneumonia. Know the Signs, and Act Fast The signs of flu-related bacterial pneumonia are distinctive you'll usually start recovering from the flu and feeling better, before suddenly developing a new fever and getting worse again . If that happens, you should see your doctor right away or visit an emergency room, according to the CDC. Bacterial pneumonia can often be treated with antibiotics. Delaying treatment of bacterial pneumonia can raise your risk of becoming seriously ill, so you shouldn't wait if you unexpectedly take a turn for the worse. You should also visit the emergency room if you start to have trouble breathing another emergency sign of viral or bacterial pneumonia. Viral pneumonia can sometimes be harder to detect, because it probably won't include a telltale period of temporary improvement. You'll have a typical case of flu at first , but instead of getting better after a few days, you'll continue to feel worse, your fever won't break, and you may have trouble breathing, says Almea Matanock, M.D., who studies pneumococcal disease at the CDC. Anyone who is in doubt about whether he has pneumonia should call his doctor immediately and ask whether he should come in to be evaluated. For children under 5, adults over 65, and anyone with an underlying health problem, it's especially important to call the doctor as soon as symptoms appear. People in these groups may especially benefit from antiviral medications, such as Tamiflu (oseltamivir), though a doctor might decide to prescribe them to anyone experiencing a severe flu complication, Rice says. Antivirals may lessen the length and severity of illness, but they work best when started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.

AAALMuJ	autos	autostrucks	The 2019 Ford Ranger and 2020 Jeep Gladiator vs. the Chevrolet Colorado and Honda Ridgeline	We hook up the trailer, head out on the highway, and hit the mud in four of the hottest littlish trucks on the market.	The pickup is as central to the American Dream as the white picket fence. It's not just the house and the 2.5 kids that we want, it's all the projects around that house, the Home Depot runs, the toys we can hitch up, and somewhere to play with them. And just because we're in a new era of global awareness and responsibility doesn't mean that dream has to die. Research the Ford Ranger , Chevrolet Colorado & Honda Ridgeline on MSN Autos But it could be downsized to a more sustainable scale. Luckily, American truckmakers have you covered. Some people call them mid-size pickups; others point out that a middle implies a point between two extremes and therefore refer to these obviously-not-small things as compact trucks. Whatever you call them, after flirting with stagnation in the early part of the decade, the less-than-full-size-pickup market is booming again. The rebirth started in 2014 when Chevrolet and GMC launched the Colorado and Canyon, respectively, on a sturdy new frame, substantially beefier than the global Colorado's. Sales of the Silverado and Sierra hardly hiccuped, while the smaller trucks' annual tally jumped from about 50,000 units to well beyond 100,000. They're represented here by a Colorado Z71, which was demoted in 2017 to second-most-capable off-roader in the Colorado lineup behind the ZR2 but still boasts a two-speed transfer case tucked behind a skid plate and a locking rear differential. With the towing package and a dealer-installed polished exhaust tip, the Colorado rings up at $38,955. Honda was hoping for a rebirth when it unveiled the new Ridge­line for 2017, but that hasn't exactly panned out. The company readily admits that the problem with the first-generation pickup was that the styling was off-putting, but then it went ahead and made the next iteration of the truck just as unconventional as before. It's a shame, because for all its minivan-with-a-bed looks, the Ridgeline is a comfortable, capable thing for people who don't regularly tow 10,000 pounds. The Ridgeline comes in one cab configuration and one bed length, with one engine-and-transmission pair sending torque to either the front or all four wheels. A loaded-up RTL-E like the one we had stickers at $43,090. Fans of the Ford Ranger -a phrase nearly as weird as "adult readers of Harry Potter "-had been crying out for the truck to return to the U.S. since the latest global version was unveiled in 2010. Buyers here can choose a smaller back seat with a longer bed or a bigger back seat and a shorter bed. Both rear- and four-wheel drive are available, but there's only one powertrain. If you want a Ranger, you get a 270-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four and a 10-speed automatic. Until Ford gives in and brings us a Raptor version, the optional FX4 package makes the top off-road Ranger. Ours checks in at $40,510. The most exciting thing to happen to this segment since NAPA started putting those hilariously lifelike giant hats on the Rangers in its delivery fleet is the Jeep Gladiator . It's kind of a Wrangler with a bed, except that it's way more than that. Jeep reengineered the entire back half of the frame so thoroughly that maximum payload jumps from 1000 pounds in the Wrangler to 1600 in certain truck trims. At 7650 pounds when optioned properly, the Gladiator's towing capacity not only exceeds the four-door Wrangler's by 4150 pounds and leads this class, but it approaches the ratings of the all-growed-up big trucks. With a starting price of $41,890 and an as-tested total of $55,485, our Overland model also rivals the big trucks in price. Since sometimes these trucks are tools and sometimes they're toys, we expanded our usual testing regimen to get a fuller impression of their capabilities. We hooked each up to a small aluminum trailer with a Honda Pioneer side-by-side on it, a load of about 3500 pounds. Then we hit the highway, charting a course for Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreational Area, an off-road park just outside of Hollister, California, where we got rained on, good and muddy, and only almost stuck. Yes, we realize we're missing a Toyota Tacoma , and that Tacos have sold in massive numbers forever, and that this whole thing about the rebirth of the segment is a lie because the Tacoma has been the segment for the last decade. But the Tacoma is so ancient that the oldest living Galápagos tortoise could have been born in its back seat. And the Nissan Frontier is older than the Galápagos archipelago itself. The reason these trucks matter is that now Tacoma and Frontier owners can buy pickups that actually behave like modern vehicles. Well, not all of them. 4th Place: Ford Ranger Highs: Smooth powertrain, butch good looks. Lows: Insufficiently reengineered from the version sold elsewhere in the world. Verdict: If you're going to be late to the party, at least get it right. Research the Ford Ranger on MSN Autos We were excited about the Ranger. Ford took its sweet time bringing this truck here, and in the years since we first saw that broad-shouldered, swaggering profile on other shores, we've been ratcheting our expectations ever higher. Ford says the North American Ranger has been significantly reengineered from the global version of the truck, but until we see a spreadsheet with different part numbers, we won't be convinced. Particularly telling was the headliner in our truck. The trailing edge was so rough that we wondered if it wasn't an SUV piece run through a band saw. We then argued at length about whether the scrap would be recycled into new headliners or used to make forts for the factory workers' kids. This half-finished feel extended to more important aspects, too. Woefully underdamped, the Ranger was always a second or two behind what the road was doing. And not only was its 193-foot stop from 70 mph the longest here, but the pedal feel was genuinely frightening. It sank through a couple of inches with no resistance or response and then grabbed with an immediacy that frequently had our heads bobbing. At Hollister Hills, the Ford's Hankook Dynapro AT-M tires reminded us that, no matter the surface, tires make the difference. There's no surprise quite like driving up a mountain on a nice sunny day only to find it raining on the drive down. The Hankooks' chunky tread design grabbed the slick adobe mud by big, gooey handfuls and dragged the Ranger through the park with relative ease. Between the tires, a useful approach angle, and the fact that Ford calls its exposed steel front skid plate a "bash plate," the FX4 was clearly the better off-road package than Chevy's Z71. Towing the trailer wasn't enough to stress the trucks, but it did serve to showcase each one's strengths and weaknesses. In addition to raising-or should we say lowering?-the braking experience to truly alarming levels, attaching the trailer highlighted the EcoBoost four-cylinder's smooth, sturdy power delivery. The less-than-huge-pickup segment doesn't place a lot of emphasis on powertrain refinement, but this Ford's four-cylinder seems designed to smash that paradigm with velveteen output. Ten speeds appear to be more than the truck really needs, but shifts are at least quick and smooth, and the four-cylinder's broad mid-range means that it never feels overburdened no matter what's going on. In at least that one way, the Ford is a high-water mark that its competitors will be striving to meet with their next-generation trucks. But in every other way, the long-awaited Ranger feels not a year ahead but a generation behind. 3rd Place: Jeep Gladiator Highs: Have you heard? They're making Wranglers with pickup beds now! Lows: Fifty-five large and that's not even the top of the pricing pyramid. Verdict: You'll love it even when you don't want to. The Jeep was, hands down, every voter's favorite. You can't not smile while driving it. It's like a golden retriever puppy. When you thumb the key fob of any of the others, you might glance over your shoulder to make sure the door locks engaged, but you run back to hug the Jeep. Heck, not only is it designed so that you can take the top and doors off, but all the necessary tools live in a little pouch in the glovebox, and tucked under one of the rear seats is a foam holder to keep track of the fasteners. We so badly wanted to let this puppy play that we had to jump it. Surprisingly, that was the Wrangler pickup's best showing off-road. With the Overland trim's Bridgestone Dueler H/T 685 pavement-biased tires and at least nine more inches of wheelbase than any other competitor here, the Jeep was even less comfortable on Hollister Hills' slippery trails than the Honda, which senior editor Tony Quiroga dubbed a "dachshund." A dachshund might scrape its belly here and there, but even with 10.0 inches of ground clearance, the most in the test, the Gladiator would belly-flop into the mud with a wet thwap and noisily drag its frame rails over crests and bumps that the drivers of the Colorado and Ranger didn't notice. It wasn't much better on-road. Consider the following radio exchange between vehicle testing director Dave VanderWerp in the Jeep and Quiroga in the Ford: DV: Over one of those whoop-de-dos, the Jeep got so out of sorts that stability control intervened with a strong stab of the brakes . . . TQ: There were whoop-de-dos? DV: Exactly. And yet, as wild as the Jeep's movements were, they were more consistent than the Ford's. Maybe it's because its suspension response was so slow that it missed entire events. Hit a stretch of washboard and the Jeep might react to only every third bump. And the Jeep responded best to the trailer, the tongue weight seeming to eat up some of the excess travel of the rear coil springs and calm the ride. The Pentastar V-6 can feel a little crude in other applications, but here, it's right at home. Like the Wrangler , the Gladiator uses recirculating-ball steering, and it feels as if there's a lot of slack in the system. You need to scrunch up the balls and firm up the worm before anything will happen. But even that wasn't enough to turn anyone off the Jeep. We'll forgive a lot of dynamic sins for something that overflows with personality the way this truck does. 2nd Place: Honda Ridgeline Highs: Everything pertaining to objective vehicular agreeability. Lows: The minivan jabs hurt because they're true. Verdict: What nearly every mid-size-pickup-truck buyer is actually looking for. Research the Honda Ridgeline | Find a Ridgeline near you It's easy for other truck buyers to disrespect the Ridgeline. But it seems as if Honda's designers set them up for it. If you wanted to make it easy in this segment to serve up your product like a punching bag, you could always make it look like a minivan. The way the Ridgeline looks is the worst thing about it. But the Ridgeline also acts and feels like a minivan in all the best ways. The cabin measurements of the four trucks are close, but the Ridgeline's interior is so airy and open that it feels as if you're flying a dirigible from inside the envelope-in the other trucks, you're down in the gondola. And that's just up front. The back seat of the Ridgeline is the only one an adult will voluntarily crawl into. And that seat easily folds tight against the back of the cab, leaving a massive space with a flat load floor, making it a cinch to transport a bunch of cargo in weather-tight security. Or you can put that stuff in the in-bed trunk, an idea that gets better the more you use it. VanderWerp christened the Honda the "right-brain pickup." It's brimming with things that would feel gimmicky if they weren't so useful-well, except for the bedsides doubling as giant stereo speakers. That one's a gimmick. While the Honda silenced the doubters with surprising competence in the towing and off-road tests, the additional stress revealed just how noisy its structure is. The suspension largely shrugged off the weight of the trailer, but the cab shuddered so badly that we had to check our hookup to make sure nothing was loose. When we got off-road, the groans as the body flexed over crests made clear that it's just not the most rigid body shell. But the fundamental goodness of the powertrain and the Ridgeline's overall package are inescapable. The ride is imperturbable, control weights and responses are light and natural, and the view out and interior space are excellent. The Ridgeline presents many benefits of a car with enough capability to do truck stuff when necessary. The downside to this is that, as Quiroga put it, the Ridgeline is competent enough to be boring. The other trucks are fun to hustle because you know you're doing something dumb. In the Ridge­line, you're just comfortably and expediently getting where you're going. Most days, that's all we want. This time, though, it turns out we wanted something different. 1st Place: Chevrolet Colorado Highs: Compared with the others, it drives like a 911. Lows: Well, a 911 with a gritty engine and a low-budget interior. Verdict: Most of the virtues of the other trucks all rolled into one. Research the Chevrolet Colorado | Look for a Chevrolet Colorado near you The days get long on comparison tests. Sometimes our attention wanes. Following a photo stop outside Buttonwillow, California, everybody was staring at their phones when photographer Marc Urbano pulled onto the road. When he radioed to ask if we were going to follow him, we scrambled our trucks and took off. In the wrong direction. For 15 minutes. With spotty cell coverage, it took that long for Urbano to get hold of one of us and tell us to turn around. But when we whipped those 180s in the mountains, nobody was enjoying the canyon-road run as much as the guy in the Colorado. The Chevy's control feel and responses are the most sports-car-like in the class. Ride motions are clipped but perfectly damped. The brake pedal is Corvette firm, with natural modulation, and generated the shortest stop in the test. Even the Colorado's driving position is reminiscent of a car's, with the seat low to the floor and sheetmetal that cradles occupants without smothering them or ruining sightlines. Technical director Eric Tingwall called it "the best-driving body-on-frame vehicle on sale today." We were less impressed with the Chevy's powertrain. The 3.6-liter thrashes around through much of the rev range, with nothing more than a gritty roar making it out of the engine room until the last couple hundred rpm before the fuel cutoff, when the sound resolves into something kind of stirring. And the transmission isn't much more couth, with unpredictable gear spacing and an overly aggressive upshift schedule that frequently had the revs lower than we wanted. But the Colorado is a well-balanced package for tool and toy duties. In spite of having the test's second-lowest ground clearance, the Chevy acquitted itself well off-road. Somebody might have snagged the lower air dam on a mound and ripped it off, but we all agreed that this at-speed modification represented an improvement to the way the Colorado looks, and that even though there's a ZR2 above the Z71 in the off-road hierarchy, an off-road special really shouldn't have a vulnerable piece of black plastic hanging down beneath its chin. And while both the Chevy and the Ford wore the appropriate tires for Hollister Hills, the Ranger's Hankooks held the ground just a touch better when the mud started getting slick. With the trailer hooked up, the Colorado's ride quality was barely changed. It still rode better than the Ford and Jeep. An outstanding toy and an effective tool, the Colorado wins because it excels no matter the task. From the May 2019 issue

Pay attention to these potential signs of infidelity. They come home later Are you used to your husband or wife arriving home by 6 p.m. to share a much-needed end-of-day martini or help with dinner, baths, and bedtime? A sudden change in that routine may be a sign of cheating. 'When someone stops coming home at the regular time, on a regular basis, be wary,' says dating and relationship advice and etiquette expert April Masini . 'When a schedule changes and there's no comment about why or what he or she is doing differently, it may be because your spouse is cheating on you.' Some people will offer an excuse for their change in routine like going to the gym late because it's less crowded (and because you're less likely to question the 'post-workout shower'), says Masini. Already know you have a cheating spouse? These are the 15 steps to surviving an affair . Date night has been replaced by a new guys-only club Not cool. Date night is a hallmark of marriage, so when your date night with your spouse disappears, it might be because they're having a date night with someone else. According to Masini, author of Think & Date Like a Man , a more experienced cheating spouse will keep your date night, but end it early because they have a 'work issue' or a 'poker game' that runs until after midnight. 'Breaking up the night to make time for date night with another lady is one way you'll know you're with someone who's probably cheating,' she says. Don't miss these secrets marriage counselors won't tell you for free . They no longer want you to do laundry While this sounds like a break for you, this may be one of the signs of cheating. 'When your spouse stops letting you do his or her laundry or drop off his or her dry cleaning, you often have a cheating situation on your hands,' says Masini. 'There may be evidence on the clothes or in the pockets, and it's much safer for someone who's cheating to handle their own laundry and dry cleaning.' She says to pay attention to a spouse who acts like they're doing you a favor because it's more about keeping a secret. You found a credit card in your spouse's name you didn't know about Most married couples have joint accounts or share information about family finances. There are budgets to consider and conversations about spending before a big purchase. 'When you find a credit card, you've got a smoking gun,' Masini says. 'Unless this is a work credit card, which you'd probably know about, a secret credit card is pretty hard and fast evidence that you've got a cheating spouse.' This is the day of the week your partner is most likely to cheat. Your spouse is too cool about the cell phone Most women who think their man is having an affair will immediately ask to see their phone to scroll through texts and incoming/outgoing calls. Don't be fooled if he lets you, says psychiatrist Scott Haltzman , MD, author of the book The Secrets of Surviving Infidelity . 'If he gives you full access, it's a sign he may have a second phone,' Dr. Haltzman says. Similarly, these are the 10 things your partner should never ask you to do . Or, he won't let you near his phone Helen, a married mom with a toddler son, says her husband never had a password on his phone because their child loved accessing the fun apps. All of a sudden that changed, and when Helen asked for the four-digit code, her husband declined and typed it in privately. Red flag alert! This is definitely one of the signs of cheating. 'Something is definitely wrong,' says Laurie Puhn , JD, a couples mediator in private practice in New York City and author of the book Fight Less, Love More: 5-Minute Conversations to Change Your Relationship without Blowing Up or Giving In . Passwords should be shared in a marriage; there are random times when you need the phone number for the plumber and it's in your husband's phone or email account, or you need to check an e-receipt that was sent to your husband. 'It's not that you need a list of his passwords, but should you ask for one for a legitimate reason he should give it to you,' says Puhn. This should not be a big deal. By not telling you the code, your spouse may be admitting to a secret of some sort. Your marriage has turned sexless 'Not wanting to have sex anymore or a lot less than usual can mean many things, including that he or she might be cheating,' says Puhn. 'Essentially if your partner is pulling away from you.' Now, this might not be one of the signs of cheating; this could also be because he is focused on an upsetting job situation, financial stress, or a family health issue, but whatever the reason, you must bring it up soon, with warmth and tact. 'Let him know that you noticed a difference and try to rekindle with daily hugs, warm smiles, a touch on the back and, of course, pursue sex. See if this opens the door to a warm heartfelt conversation.' Your husband is suddenly Mr. Gift Giver A 'just because' spa gift card or new purse completely unrelated to a birthday, anniversary, or work promotion could be a lovely surprise, or it could be a clue that your partner is feeling guilty about something and trying to compensate. 'Have a direct conversation,' advises Puhn. You could say something like: 'It's only been in the last few months that you are bringing me surprise presents. While this is thoughtful, I am wondering if something led you to start doing this?' See what he says and watch how he acts. 'Also, look for other clues, like if he cancels plans and those long-stem roses are some sort of consolation prize.' It could signal you've got a cheating spouse on your hands. These are the 8 marriage myths you can safely ignore . He has a special Facebook friend Nicole sat down to her family computer and up popped a big surprise: a message from a woman that read, 'I can't stop thinking about you, baby. When will I see you again?' Face it: Social media friends don't message like that. They congratulate each other on the birth of a new baby or a cool vacation photo. When the conversation gets racy, it's one of the very clear signs of cheating. 'Most cheaters these days are caught via text or on social media,' says dating and relationship expert Rachel Russo . 'When women snoop on a man or accidentally find something, it's often what they suspected. There could be incriminating photos, texts, or a call history that would prove to be evidence of an affair.' These are the 10 things never to do after your partner cheats . There are blackouts 'I'm not talking about someone being unconscious,' says Masini. 'I'm talking about a spouse having blackout periods where you don't know where he or she is, you can't reach them, and you don't get a viable explanation about where they've been or why they didn't respond to a call or text.' It takes two seconds to send a text and it's not normal for a married or seriously committed couple to be out of touch for hours wondering what the heck is going on. Here are tips for staying connected with your partner when you have to be apart . They ditch family time with the kids 'When a partner starts pulling away from people and occasions that are usually a high priority, it could be a cause for concern,' says relationship expert Amy Spencer , author of Meeting Your Half-Orange . 'Every person is unique in how they balance work and family, so the key lies in whether or not a behavior is 'so not like him.'' Work does get in the way of family occasions, Spencer acknowledges, and let's be honest, sometimes it's a handy 'get out of jail free card' for family events he might not be as into. 'But if your partner has always enjoyed BBQs with the family and kids, and if work has never gotten in the way of events like this before, it raises a red flag.' They have new hobbies that exclude you 'Of course it's wonderful if a partner takes on a new hobby, especially one that contributes to his/her health,' says Spencer of this one of our signs of cheating. 'But there are two causes for concern. First, if they appear to dive into a hobby out of the blue, rather than talking about the hobby a lot or easing slowly into it. And second, if they devote an unusual amount of hours or efforts to it.' For example, a person who suddenly begins running every night for stretches as long as three hours. One way to gauge the truth is to tell your partner that you support his hobby and it would be nice to follow along on their progress. Then, think about how a person who really is devoted to running would respond. They would likely be proud to share the route they're mapping out or the time they're trying to beat. 'If your partner insists on being vague, that could be a concern.' Now, find out what to do if you're the one who was caught cheating .

AAwyZza	finance	finance-savemoney	No Membership Card Necessary: 7 Ways Anyone Can Shop at Costco	Here's how to walk the aisles of Costco without paying to join the beloved warehouse club.	Americans love Costco. It has dominated the American Consumer Satisfaction Index for three years running, outranking not only other warehouse clubs but other retailers in general as well. Perhaps it's no wonder the chain has more than 92 million card-carrying members. Still, Costco memberships have become more expensive in the past year   and it turns out you can enjoy some aspects of Costco without a membership anyway. So, if you let your membership lapse or are unsure whether it's worth joining Costco, consider some of these methods for shopping the beloved wholesale chain without paying for a membership: 1. Shop online Anyone can shop Costco.com, although there are two hitches for nonmembers: You will be charged a 5 percent surcharge , so you'll pay 5 percent more than the product prices you see on Costco's website. The only exception is for prescription drugs. You cannot redeem the " Members-Only Savings " offers. Additionally, some items sold in Costco clubs   like many foods   are unavailable on Costco's website. Still, if you prefer to shop online or you spend less than $1,200 a year at Costco, paying the nonmember surcharge might make more sense than buying a membership. As long as you spend less than $1,200 a year on Costco's site, the 5 percent surcharge would amount to less than the cost of a $60 annual membership. 2. Use a gift card Costco gift cards are known as Costco Cash Cards . They have no expiration date and are available in amounts from $25 to $1,000. Only members can buy Costco Cash Cards or add money to them, but anyone can use them as payment. Specifically, according to the card terms, this means "nonmembers may use the Costco Cash Cards to shop at any Costco location in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and online." The 5 percent nonmember surcharge will still apply to online purchases, however. If you don't shop at Costco often, a Costco Cash Card might make more sense than a membership card. So, consider asking a friend or relative who is a Costco member if they'd buy you a card and let you pay them back or pay them upfront for it. 3. Go as a guest Here's another option for folks who want to shop in a Costco club but won't do so often. Costco allows members to bring up to two guests every time they visit a club. Only members can purchase items, but you could offer to pay back the member you accompany for anything you picked out. 4. Use a Household Card If you live with a Costco member, you might be able to get a free membership card in the form of what Costco calls a "Household Card." Costco's individual membership comes with one membership card for the primary member as well as one free Household Card. The latter card can be used by anyone who is over the age of 18 and lives at the same address as the primary member. Costco's Business Membership also comes with one free Household Card for every paying member, meaning the primary member and any add-on members (aka affiliates). 5. Use a delivery service Some third-party delivery services, such as Instacart and Google Express , will pick up what you want from Costco for you and bring it to your home. There's no waiting in line and no membership necessary on your part. These services aren't available in every city and generally aren't free, though. On top of the cost of your purchases, you'll usually pay a delivery fee, presumably a tip and possibly an additional fee if you are not a Costco member. 6. See the optometrist In need of an eye exam? Nonmembers can see on-site optometrists at Costco clubs. Nonmembers cannot purchase optical items, though. So, it might be wise to first check out " Lookin' Good! How to Get a Killer Deal on Eyeglasses ." Not all Costco clubs have optical departments. Visit the " Find a Warehouse " page to look up specific locations, and click on "Store Details" to find out whether a location has an optical department. It's not the usual blah, blah, blah. Click here to sign up for our free newsletter. 7. Buy prescription drugs Prescription drugs are the one exception to Costco's 5 percent surcharge for nonmembers who order online. Additionally, nonmembers can generally use the pharmacies in Costco clubs. Just note that this can vary from state to state due to differences in state laws. Costco states that pharmacies are open to nonmembers " where required by state law ." Also, not all Costco locations have pharmacies. So, nonmembers might want to call ahead before using a brick-and-mortar Costco pharmacy for the first time. Again, visit the " Find a Warehouse " page to find out whether a location has a pharmacy. If your prescription drug costs are limited to co-pays and you don't frequent Costco, you're probably better off using your nearest pharmacy. But if you pay out of pocket for prescriptions, compare what you currently pay to what Costco charges for your medications. Costco pharmacies also carry pet medications .

BBKRX2H	autos	autosreview	2018 Jeep Compass 4x4 Automatic	2018 Jeep Compass Sport	Beyond grade school, participation awards stop being cute and begin to evoke a sort of backhanded faint praise. Jeep's Compass qualifies for such an award. Unlike its woefully uncompetitive predecessor, the second-generation Compass is an utterly average small crossover, one undeserving of a broader accolade. For even deeper coverage of the Compass, view our Buyer's Guide in-depth review . If the Compass deserves any prize, it's of the consolation variety. Can't afford Jeep's handsome, versatile Grand Cherokee? The massively cheaper Compass looks much the same, merely scaled down and dressed up with a nifty floating roof design. Aping the Grand Cherokee's look is by far the smaller Jeep's greatest success. Even in base-model Sport trim, as tested here, we like the cut of the Compass' jib, although the relatively dinky 16-inch aluminum wheels let some wind out of the Jeep's sails, visually. (Bigger sizes are available on the uplevel Latitude, Altitude, Limited, and Trailhawk trims.) In fact, those tiny tires are the reason for this evaluation: We've tested a front-drive Compass Limited (which uses a six-speed automatic transmission instead of AWD models' nine-speed), a stick-shift all-wheel-drive Sport , and a Trailhawk (which wears aggressive off-road tires). This is our first experience with an all-wheel drive, automatic-transmission Compass on street-friendly rubber. Jeep Doe, Size Compact As with other Compasses, this Sport behaves anonymously and slots into the very narrow crevice between the (barely) smaller Jeep Renegade and the (barely) larger Cherokee. Naturally, there's overlap. The Compass's passenger volume is just two cubic feet less than that of the Cherokee, and cargo space is essentially the same between the two (the Compass actually holds five more cubic feet of stuff with its rear seats folded down than its bigger sibling). Thanks to its more upright cabin, the Compass's interior feels airier and less cockpit-like than the Cherokee's, which suffers from a high floor and a relatively low roof, and it's not nearly as narrow and weirdly high-ceilinged as the Renegade's. In spite of its rather substantial 180 horsepower-a competitive number among even full-blown compact SUVs such as the Honda CR-V and the Mazda CX-5-the Compass isn't quick. Our test car needed 9.3 seconds to reach 60 mph, and for those curious as to what 100 mph feels like, nearly half a minute of wide-open throttle (and its attendant grumbly, whooshing engine noise) is required to get there. The rest of the Compass's dynamics, controlled via a numb steering rack and a squishy brake pedal, are similarly average for the class, including its longish 184-foot stop from 70 mph and 0.79 g of lateral grip. Our observed fuel economy of 21 mpg comes in below the EPA city estimate of 22, which isn't a badge of honor. The nine-speed automatic transmission, in particular, leaves a lot to be desired. It often struggles to choose a gear, leaving you in the lurch while it decides and frustrating further when it ultimately picks the wrong one-usually one that's too high. Plan ahead when passing, both because the Jeep is slow and because the transmission's downshifts are even slower. Accelerating from a stop reveals the drivetrain's most annoying behavior. The engine's stop/start feature (which is standard on all-wheel-drive models with the nine-speed) shuts the engine down when stopped at a light then attempts to re-fire the engine while the transmission trips over itself fumbling for first or second gear. This translates into a pregnant pause when, say, you're pressing the gas trying to make a left-hand turn through a gap in traffic. When the system finally catches up to your request, the engine seemingly fires just as the transmission slams into a gear, bucking the car forward like you've been rear-ended. The six-speed automatic in front-drive Compasses provides much smoother take-offs. The Price Is Not Quite Right Although the Sport sits at the bottom of the Compass hierarchy, its interior appointments don't give away its station. Although unexceptional, the cabin's plastics and cloth pieces are arranged into an inoffensive, quality-looking composition. Even at speed, the Compass is quiet inside, and while the body elicited a few creaks, the suspension largely absorbs bad pavement with little noise or harshness. In spite of the Jeep's weak grip, its chassis stays relatively flat in hard cornering, giving it a friendly, secure handling disposition. Again, like its size, the Compass's execution lands somewhere on the better side of subcompact SUVs but merely so-so amongst more refined, larger compacts. Our test vehicle's $895 Technology group replaced the standard 5.0-inch Uconnect touchscreen with a larger 7.0-inch unit that features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as second color display in the gauge cluster. As we've come to expect from Uconnect, the Jeep's touchscreen features thoughtfully arranged menus and is easy to use-and for less than a grand, the big screen is a steal. The climate controls, buried low on the dashboard ahead of the shift lever, are a bit of a reach, but at least their settings can be seen on the touchscreen closer to the driver's line of sight. The Compass's value beyond that Technology package, however, is dubious. The Compass Sport starts at an affordable $22,590, but adding all-wheel drive and the required nine-speed automatic transmission raises the asking price by $3000. Our test car also came equipped with the $845 Cold Weather group (heated front seats, heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote start, and more), the $795 Sport Appearance group (black roof rails and 16-inch aluminum wheels in place of steel rims), and a $245 compact spare tire. That brought our base-model Compass Sport to $28,370, and that's sans any active-safety features such as collision warning, blind-spot monitoring, or adaptive cruise control. (For basics such as lane-departure warning and blind-spot monitoring, Jeep forces you into the pricier Compass Latitude 4x4, where those features require an additional $1790 in option packages.) A similarly equipped mid-level Mazda CX-5 Touring with all-wheel drive costs $670 less than the optioned-up Latitude and comes with blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, automated emergency braking, rain-sensing wipers, and more. And that's to say nothing of it being a 10Best Truck and SUV awardee with performance that shades this Jeep. It's a similar story with Honda's CR-V, itself a former 10Bester. It's refreshing that Jeep allows a fair amount of à la carte option ordering among all of the Compass's trim levels, but at near or above $30,000, you have to really want to want a Jeep badge-or need the Trailhawk model's off-road chops. Neither good nor bad, the tweener Compass simply is. We could give it a medal, but you know what sort it'd be.

"It's been quite a life," Hussey, 67, tells PEOPLE of her journey. "I feel grateful that I survived it all." Born in Buenos Aires and raised in London, Hussey was just 15 years old when she nabbed the coveted role of Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's film, which became an international hit. "So much happened so fast," says Hussey. "It was overnight superstardom and I wasn't prepared for it." Overwhelmed by the fame and attention, Hussey took a step back and focused on her budding relationship with Christopher Jones, a young actor whom she had met through her agent, Rudi Altobelli. But soon after they began dating, Jones began to abuse her. "We were talking and his eyes glazed over and he punched me in the stomach," Hussey says. The physical and emotional abuse continued, but Hussey stuck by him. "I was young, and I loved him," she says. "I was very loyal." Around the same time, Hussey recalls her brief conversation with a pregnant Sharon Tate, who, along with her husband, Roman Polanski, were renting the Los Angeles home of Altobelli in the summer of 1969. "I said to Sharon, 'Rudy said we're going to be best friends,'" Hussey says of their phone call. "She told me, 'I'm so looking forward to meeting you, my baby is coming soon.' She was so sweet." For more about Hussey, check out this week's issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday. Hussey was planning to move to Los Angeles and into the guest house. "I was going to stay there and I'd get to help Sharon with the baby," she says. "Then Rudi got the call." The call was to deliver the shocking news that Tate, along with four others, were murdered at Altobelli's home on August 9 while he was away. "I'll never forget Rudi telling me," says Hussey. "He said, 'They're all dead.' It was terrible." But just five weeks after the murders, Hussey, who had summoned up the courage to break up with Jones, moved into the house. "People would say, 'How could you live there?'" she says. "I'd say, 'In England, most of the houses have horrible memories. It's not that big of a deal.'" Says Hussey: "All I felt was Sharon's vibration. And it was lovely. She'd left an orange scarf and I kept it on my prayer table for years." But Hussey's own nightmare had yet to happen. One night, Jones showed up at the house and brutally attacked and raped her. "I didn't know if he was going to kill me," says Hussey. "My face was like a balloon. I had a bloody nose, my lip was split open, and I had a black eye. It was terrifying." Weeks later, Hussey, who told very few people about the attack (Jones died in 2014), discovered she was pregnant. "I decided I could not have the baby," she writes in the book of having a subsequent abortion. "It broke my heart…although I have never regretted it." Actor Johnathon Schaech: I Was Molested by Director Franco Zeffirelli Still, Hussey says now that the silver lining was falling in love with her future husband, Dean Paul Martin, the son of singer Dean Martin. "I fell for him because of the way he treated me and took care of me," says Hussey. The couple wed in 1971 and had one son, Alex, now 45. They split in 1979 but remained close friends until his tragic death in a plane crash in 1987. Hussey had another son, 35 year old Max, with her second husband, Japanese singer Akira Fuse, before meeting her current husband of 29 years, rocker David Glen Eisley, with whom she has a daughter India, 24. "Everyone has their issues and their problems," Hussey says of getting through dark times. "But I'm so happy to be where I am now."

Insider spoke to bartenders, bar managers, and beverage experts to learn about some common mistakes people make when they order drinks at a bar. If a bar is crowded, avoid ordering hot drinks and cocktails that are time-consuming to make. Some bartenders dread hearing the words "surprise me" when patrons can't decide on a order. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. Ordering a drink at a bar doesn't have to be complicated - but if you want to optimize your drinking experience, it helps to know some of the things you might be doing that could be messing up your cocktail order or confusing your bartender. To keep your drink-ordering process smooth and quick, Insider asked bartenders and beverage experts about some of the most common drink-ordering mistakes they see bar patrons make. Here are some mistakes you could be making when ordering drinks and how you can avoid making them in the future. Asking a bartender to make you their favorite cocktail isn't the best way to get a drink you'll enjoy Although it seems like a reasonable tactic, asking a bartender to make you their favorite cocktail could result in you paying for a drink you don't really like, especially since your personal preferences could be entirely different from theirs. "While I know the customer is attempting to be congenial and make a connection [by asking this question], oftentimes what I like to drink or what I enjoy making isn't going to be what they want to drink," said bar manager Nicky Beyries of Laszlo and Foreign Cinema in San Francisco, California. If you want to increase your chances of getting a drink you'll actually enjoy, Beyries said you should ask the bartender to recommend you a drink based on some of your personal preferences. "Giving the bartender a few parameters - spirits you do or don't like, a type of drink you're in the mood for, or something you often enjoy means they can either direct you to something on the menu or play dealer's choice," Beyries told Insider. Read more: The 9 most annoying things your group can do at a bar, according to a bartender When a venue is busy, most bartenders prefer that you and your entire group are ready to order before you even approach the bar Although it's always OK to ask the bartender questions about the drink menu, it's a wise idea to at least have some sort of idea of what you and your group want to order before you approach a bartender. "If you notice it's particularly busy or hard to get a drink because the bartender is helping other guests, help out the bartender by having an efficient conversation [with your group] to convey the needs of your party quickly," said bartender Ben Potts of Beaker & Gray in Miami, Florida. "It's not a requirement, it's just a decent thing to do." Telling a bartender to surprise you with a drink probably won't result in you getting a cocktail you want "Most bartenders genuinely want to make you something you'll like, which is why 'surprise me' is such a kick in the pants," Katie Molchan and Elaina Holko, bartenders and bar owners at Mixtape in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, told Insider. "While patrons should absolutely continue to lean on the expertise of their bartender, they need to remember that we likely don't know anything about them." If you want a surprise drink, Molchan and Holko said you should tell your bartender three things: the spirits you like (such as gin or vodka), the flavor you're craving (such as sweet, bitter, or spicy), and the strength you're in the mood for (something strong or light). During peak bar hours, you may want to avoid ordering hot drinks and cocktails that are time-consuming to make There's nothing wrong with ordering a work-intensive, intricate beverage but if you order one during peak hours at a bar, keep in mind that you might not receive the best possible version of the drink and it could take quite a while for you to get it. "Timing can definitely matter," said head bartender Josh Cameron of Boulton & Watt in New York City. When a bar is incredibly busy, Cameron said it's not the best idea to order a hot cocktail, like a Hot Toddy, because they typically require more effort to make than a drink that's served on ice. Elayne Duff, the director of trade development for New York City's Liquor Lab , also said if you order complicated cocktails during a busy time, your order might not be well-received by the bar's staff and it may take a while for you to get your drink. If a bar is busy and you want your drink in a timely manner, she said you might want to order a more simple cocktail. Telling a bartender to make your drink 'strong' probably won't accomplish much "Cocktails have specific recipes. [Telling a bartender to make your drink strong] is like telling a chef to make your food good. If you want something strong, order a tequila shot," Alex Vines, bar manager of Fulton Alley in New Orleans, Louisiana, told Insider. Assuming every brand of spirits pairs well with every type of mixer can lead to some not-so-great drink orders When it comes to hard liquor, many drinkers assume that all vodkas, gins, and rums taste more or less the same. But each liquor brand uses unique distilling methods and base ingredients that can results in spirits with noticeably varied taste profiles. "The mistake most people make is they tend to stick with what they know, even if the drink they're ordering clashes with the flavors of the spirit they ask for," said beverage director Juliana Montebello-Roman of PR Italian Bistro in Chicago, Illinois. Even if you're ordering a simple drink with soda water, the type of spirit you choose can entirely change the flavor of your drink, added Kevin Flannery, general manager and spirits specialist of Ocean Prime in New York City. Although it's helpful to know which brands of liquor you prefer, it could be helpful to ask bartenders for their spirit recommendations when you order certain mixed drinks. Read more: I'm a bartender - here are 7 brands you're spending way too much money on When ordering your drink, speak up and avoid using unnecessary abbreviations It's important to avoid using unnecessary abbreviations when ordering a drink because you might confuse the bartender or accidentally order something else. "Clarity is key - bars are typically noisy and it's hard to hear. Enunciating and saying exactly what you want helps ensure you get what you ordered," said bar manager August O'Mahoney of Baltaire in Los Angeles, California. "Sometimes people think they're being cool and abbreviate things, like asking for a glass of 'Chard' instead of 'Chardonnay' or asking for 'Pinot' when it could [mean] Pinot Noir or Pinot Grigio, and it's hard to understand," he added. Knowing the differences between ordering a drink 'neat' or 'up' can come in handy Knowing a few basic bar terms can help you get the drink you actually meant to order. Eamon Rockey, director of beverage studies at The Institute of Culinary Education , said some of the most common terms that confuse bar patrons are "neat" and "up." A "neat" drink is typically poured straight from the bottle into an old-fashioned glass . "Neat" drinks are usually served at room temperature and they are meant to be sipped. When you order something "up," it typically means you want your drink served cold. Rockey said a drink ordered "up" is "a full drink's measure of spirit, simply chilled over ice, and strained into a stemmed cocktail glass." Instead of ordering something you aren't sure about, try asking the bartender questions about the cocktail menu "Many guests visiting craft cocktail bars are timid and afraid to ask questions about the menu, [so] they end up ordering something they don't like by mistake, or they choose to go with something recognizable and safe that perhaps they recognize from an advertisement," said beverage director Sam Nelis of Caledonia Spirits' Barr Hill in Montpelier, Vermont. But all of the bartenders that Insider spoke to agreed on one crucial point - a good bartender wants to make you a drink that you'll enjoy. So don't be afraid to ask questions if you're confused about a bar's cocktail menu. RELATED VIDEO: 47 drinks to try before you die

If you really want to rake in the cash, join several survey sites to maximize access to opportunities. SurveySavvy, GlobalTestMarket and American Consumer Opinion are just a few of the sites that will pay you to share your thoughts. Test Websites Many businesses pay people to visit their sites and test functionality and user friendliness. Fortunately, getting into website testing is relatively easy. Simply sign up for free on sites like StartUpLift, TryMyUI or UserTesting, which pays a $10 flat rate for each completed test. More in Tech Finance: Ways to Make Money Through Virtual Reality Participate in Mock Trials You don't need to know insider lawyer secrets or have a law degree to make money in the legal sector. Websites such as eJury and OnlineVerdict pay users to participate in mock trials for their clients, who are mainly lawyers. Online juries give lawyers the chance to "pre-try" their cases before presenting them in court. The lawyers gain experience, and you earn a little something for your effort: eJury pays $5 to $10 depending on the length of the case. Get Paid to Search Services such as Microsoft Rewards offer incentives to users who search and browse the web with Microsoft. You can then redeem the points for rewards like movies , games, gift cards and apps. Another site where you can earn points while you search, shop and watch is Swagbucks, which has paid out over $280 million to its members to date. Install Software You need your own website to take advantage of this nontraditional job opportunity. However, installing software is one of the easier ways to use technology to make money . Sites such as PerInstallCash offer money to users in exchange for hosting software on their pages. You get paid when visitors download and install the software from you.

Additionally, you will have to pay taxes on your winnings, so be sure to take that into account before spending all your "free money." Enter Competitions If you have time and a special skill, consider entering a competition with a cash prize. At worst, you participate, fail and wind up with a good story to tell. If you win, the prizes can be substantial. Just take a look at the payout for winning Nathan s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest .

The poorest town in each state Home to just 4% o f the world's population and nearly 25% of global economic activity, the United States is one of the richest countries in the world . Despite the concentration of wealth in the United States, parts of the country have been left behind. In nearly every state, there is at least one town where financial hardship and poverty are the defining characteristics. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the median annual household income in over 2,600 cities, towns, villages, and Census designated places to identify the poorest town in every state. We only considered areas with populations between 1,000 and 25,000. To ensure accuracy, we only considered places where the margin of error for population and median household income was less than 10%. Even in wealthy states like Maryland and New Jersey , there are towns where about half of all households earn $35,000 a year or less. In the majority of towns on this list, the share of residents living below the poverty line is more than double the share across the state as a whole. In many of these places, low incomes have forced large segments of the population to depend on government assistance. In the majority of the 50 towns on this list, at least one in every five residents receive SNAP benefits -- formerly known as food stamps. All data on income, education, poverty, and demographics are five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey. Click or swipe through to see the full list. Alabama: Selma > Median household income: $24,223 (state: $46,472) > Poverty rate: 38.3% (state: 18.0%) > Median home value: $89,100 (state: $132,100) > Population: 19,176 Selma is the only town in Alabama where over half of all households earn less than $25,000 a year. In Jackson, the second poorest town in the state, the typical household earns just over $30,000, and the median annual household income across the state as a whole is $46,472. Because so many in Selma live on such low incomes, a relatively large share of the population depends on government support to pay for basic necessities. The SNAP, or food stamps, recipiency rate in Selma is 38%, more than double the 15% rate across the state as a whole. Alaska: Ketchikan > Median household income: $56,372 (state: $76,114) > Poverty rate: 12.4% (state: 10.2%) > Median home value: $237,000 (state: $261,900) > Population: 8,195 Alaska is one of the wealthiest states in the country. The median annual household income in Alaska is $76,114, more than in every other state except for New Jersey and Maryland. Even in Ketchikan, the poorest town in the state, the typical household earns $56,372 a year -- only slightly less than the national median household income of $57,652. Ketchikan residents are also less likely to live below the poverty line than most Americans. Ketchikan's 12.4% poverty rate is considerably lower than the 14.6% national poverty rate.

Additionally, nearly 15% of South Tucson households earn less than $10,000 a year, more than triple the 4.6% share of all Arizona households. Arkansas: Helena-West Helena > Median household income: $21,667 (state: $43,813) > Poverty rate: 42.5% (state: 18.1%) > Median home value: $75,400 (state: $118,500) > Population: 11,210 Trailing only Mississippi, Arkansas is the second poorest state in the country, with a median household income of just $43,813 a year. In Helena-West Helena, Arkansas's poorest town, over 50% of households earn less than $22,000 a year.

Let's just say that this ceramic beast of a charcoal grill and smoker has hatched n...	We aren't here to judge the cultural phenomenon that has formed around the Big Green Egg since its 1970s debut. Let's just say that this ceramic beast of a charcoal grill and smoker has hatched numerous copycat cookers and die-hard devotees who call themselves Eggheads. We can, however, evaluate its performance and help you answer the question: Does anyone really need a $1,000-plus kamado grill? For that price, you might expect an actual fossilized dinosaur egg, not a grill that looks like one. After all, some of our top-rated gas models cost a quarter of that price. And you can snag one of the best kettle- or barrel-style charcoal grills from our tests for as little as $100. But the Big Green Egg isn't trying to be an alternative to traditional grills and, frankly, its design has little in common with them anyway. Rather than adjusting gas burners or arranging charcoal briquettes as you would in a conventional charcoal grill to concentrate heat, you fill a kamado grill's lower hemisphere to capacity with lump hardwood charcoal. Once the coals are going, the design starts to make sense: Cast-ceramic walls an inch thick and a heavy lid with a heatproof gasket team up to trap heat. That allows you to use the dampers to precisely control the temperature. "The Big Green Egg was the only widely known kamado grill for years," says Mark Allwood, a market analyst who oversees grills for Consumer Reports. "But in the past few years, we've seen lots of kamado models from other brands trying to capitalize on the popularity of the Egg." (The category gets its name from the ancient Japanese cooking urn.) We were wowed by the Big Green Egg a few years back when we compared it with a conventional charcoal grill. But with so many newcomers to the kamado market, we wondered whether it was still a smart buy. To answer that question, our team of engineers tested a batch of metal and ceramic kamado grills at prices from $300 to $1,500. The brands included Weber, Kamado Joe, Vision, Pit Boss, Broil-King, Char-Broil, and Char-Griller. How CR Tests Kamado Grills We started by assessing the cooking performance of each kamado. Could it get thin-crust pizza hot enough to crisp the crust without burning the toppings? Next, we used pork shoulder to see whether the grill could cook low and slow for long stretches, all while maintaining a consistent temperature. Every kamado grill we tested excels in our cooking tests, but they differ significantly in two key areas: convenience and cleaning. The best kamados not only cook well but also make it easy to build a hot fire or dial down the temperature for ribs or brisket. They're also easy to clean. Many have ash catchers, or trays, while others need to be disassembled for a thorough cleaning. If you're curious about kamados, our grill buying guide is a great place to learn a little more about the landscape. CR members can also access our ratings of gas, charcoal, and kamado grills . CR members can read on for our in-depth test results for the Big Green Egg. And regardless of which kamado grill you use, there are certain tips that will help ensure great results. Below, we've highlighted five of the foods that we think are best on a kamado and provided expert tips for preparing each. Detailed Test Results for the Big Green Egg Kamado grills, including the Big Green Egg, are designed to maintain low temperatures for long, slow cooking and produce a roaring fire for searing steaks or grilling pizzas. When we tested the Big Green Egg for both capabilities, it did extremely well, like the other grills in its class. The full article is available to ConsumerReports.org subscribers.

Believe it or not, summer is just around the corner, and if you're looking to tighten up your midsection, lose some of the stubborn fat and gain some muscle, keep reading. To accomplish some of these things it will not only take a structured diet, but also a lot of hard work. Especially when it's so easy to lounge in sweats all day and choose Netflix over your Bowflex. But hey, you gotta fight that dreaded 'Covid-15' somehow, and it's going to take work. Turning fat into muscle can only be done by getting into a set workout routine and getting after it. However, too many people make the mistake of going to the gym to make those gains, but they slack on their diet and they don't see any results. Working out will help you build the body you want, but your diet will allow you to really see the effects of your discipline. In order to make your workouts as efficient as possible at turning fat into muscle, you have to fuel your body properly. You are what you eat. Junk food will not be processed by your metabolism in a way that will give you energy for the workouts, nor will your body burn existing fat if your constantly giving it carbohydrates to burn off first. Instead, you want your diet to have a heavy ratio of proteins and fats. Yes, fat is the body's most soluble energy source, but only when it is fresh in your blood stream, not after it's been stored. So here is your new grocery list that will help your body become a fat burning, muscle-building machine. 1. Eggs Start your morning off with eggs. Two or three should do the trick. Eggs are a high in protein, high in fat and low in carbohydrates. The reason you want this type of ratio in the morning is because these fats and proteins will metabolize very slowly, much slower than carbohydrates. The proteins will help repair and rebuild any muscles that were touched on the day before, helping you recover before your next workout later in the day. 2. Almonds Almonds are the most carbohydrate rich food on your new grocery list. Eat a handful of these about three hours after your breakfast, right in between breakfast and lunch. The main reason for eating these mid-morning is because you want the bulk of your carbohydrate consumption to come in the morning before your workout. You shouldn't completely cut out carbohydrates. That is one of the biggest pits you could fall into because you would be fatiguing yourself. These carbohydrates will be used as energy up until your workout. Just don't eat too many or you will have to sacrifice valuable gym time burning these carbohydrates instead of the fat which is our target. 3. Tuna or Turkey My personal favorite is tuna. It is conveniently packaged or canned to eat on the go or while at work with no refrigeration needed. However, its non-fishy alternative, turkey, is just as good nutritionally but will need to be refrigerated. Either two pouches or cans of tuna or about 8 ounces of turkey should be eaten for lunch. This is about three hours after your almonds. Tuna and turkey have almost no fat or carbohydrates. The high protein content will be working to promote the muscle growth.

The grapefruit is high in citrus which acts as somewhat of an energy booster for your workout. Studies have also shown that it can help people lose weight due to speeding up the metabolism. With this increased metabolic rate, you should have no problem digesting the rest of the carbohydrates from the almonds so that your body can get straight to breaking down the fats. Sunflower seeds are high in fat and about even in carbohydrates and proteins. These fats are intended to be used as energy for your workout, but don't eat too many so that your body can finish those fats and start to work on your stored fat. You should eat about half of a grapefruit and half a handful of sunflower seeds. Eat this meal and head straight to the gym for the most efficient results. 5. Spinach and Chicken This post workout meal should be consumed within an hour of the end of your workout. Chicken is high in protein and low in fat and carbohydrates. The idea here is to feed your body the necessary nutrients for it to rebuild overnight, when most recovery takes place. You want to eat as little fat and carbs as you can before bed, in order to prevent fat from storing up around your midsection. Spinach is a great all around vegetable that aids digestion. Really, you can eat any green vegetable with this meal, but I suggest spinach for its fiber content and countless other benefits. This diet will take time to adjust to and if you feel hungry in between meals, drink a bunch of water. Sign up for Spy's Newsletter .

AAxXAye	autos	autoscompact	Ford Focus RS vs. Honda Civic Type R vs. Volkswagen Golf R vs. Subaru WRX STI Type RA	Sport compact car revival: Four pocket rockets vie for the title of best hot hatch	Every generation has one. Volkswagen Golf GTI. Acura Integra GS-R. Mitsubishi Evo. If you smuggled automotive magazines in from Europe, perhaps it was the Renault 5 Turbo or Ford Escort Cosworth. No matter who you are or where you grew up, odds are you remember your first hot hatch a plebeian-skinned powerhouse designed around the democratization of performance and practicality. Some looked like ATMs on wheels; others had sloping lines approximating a coupe. But they all held the same secret: startling horsepower and tight handling underneath their econobox sheetmetal. Me? I'll never forget the first time I saw a Subaru WRX . I was about 12 years old. It was a snowy winter morning, made colder by the wind ripping off an angry Hudson River. My dad and I were lugging my hockey gear through the parking lot of Manhattan's Sky Rink at some ungodly pre-dawn hour for practice. He pointed to some bug-eyed car parked alongside the pier. "You see that?" he asked. "It's a Subaru WRX. I read that it was faster than a 911." "That thing?" I could hardly believe it, but I loved the idea that a relatively affordable, dorky-looking compact could smoke a sleek, expensive Porsche . A new PlayStation 2 and copy of Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec under the Christmas tree only cemented the love of cars like the Subaru WRX and its rival Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII not just for me but for millennials and Gen Xers across the country. Then the 2008 recession took the wind out of the economy and killed the sport compact car as well as the eponymous magazine. Now that the economy is well and truly thriving, some automakers are once again offering a revival of choices of blisteringly quick sport compacts. Sure, Mitsubishi may have traded building Evos for SUVs, but my first-blush Subaru still stands the track-ready 2018 Subaru WRX STI Type RA is arguably the baddest WRX ever to hit our shores. Others are back in the game, too. Continuing its hot hatch history (offered for the first time in America), the big-winged Honda Civic Type R generates an outrageous 306 hp from just 2.0 liters of turbocharged fury. Representing Detroit by way of its German operations and sporting the same rally-bred heritage as the Subaru: the Ford Focus RS. Rounding out the offerings is the autobahn-storming Volkswagen Golf R a GTI with a seriously bad attitude. One of these four is the best sport compact on the road today, and we set up a battery of tests focused purely on finding the best driver's car of the bunch. Our playground? Southern California. We'll use Malibu's canyon roads, our Fontana test track, and the Streets of Willow Springs racetrack with our on-staff race car driver Randy Pobst behind the wheel as our proving grounds. Money plays a big role in the purchase of any car, let alone a car aimed at a younger, currently debt-saddled generation. But although sport compact cars do have sensibility and functionality baked into their silhouettes and packaging, we wouldn't be doing justice to these four cars by focusing on value, fuel economy, or interior features. This comparison is built around one word. The F-word. Fun. Our winner doesn't necessarily need to be the fastest or pull the highest lateral g through a corner. But the car has to reward its driver with snappy acceleration, exceptional steering, and the ability to put a smile on your face while doing it. So in the words of our late, lamented sister publication: Let the ass-kicking begin. Fourth Place: Subaru WRX STI Type RA Stuck on 11 Subaru is still cranking out ever-faster WRXs, so say hi to the 2018 Subaru WRX STI Type RA. Limited to just 575 examples (500 for the U.S., 75 for Canada), the Type RA gets a revised 2.5-liter turbo flat-four good for 310 hp and 290 lb-ft of torque, a beefier short-throw six- speed manual transmission, Bilstein suspension dampers, a carbon-fiber roof and rear wing, and sticky performance tires. The Type RA also benefits from the changes Subaru made to the rest of the WRX STI lineup for 2018, with uprated Brembo brakes, a center differential with fully electric locking (instead of electric and mechanical locks), and a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system. This limited edition Subaru has a price to match its rarity it stickers for $49,855. During our long testing days, caffeine is king unless you have the keys to the Type RA. "Lighting your hair on fire could not make this car any more exciting," associate editor Scott Evans said. It's a brutal assault on your senses over the top, exhausting, and more of a workout than any street-going STI in recent memory. Nothing comes easy. The Subaru's engine feels straight out of a turbocharged 1980s rally car. It's lazier than The Dude at low end, but once boost hits at 3,000 rpm, it surges forward, only to be held back by its ridiculously short gear ratios. You better get used to muscling that notchy shifter from gate to gate. The Type RA doesn't get any more manageable through bends. Steering is quick and heavy but lacks the feedback you'd expect from a hydraulic steering rack, and the track-oriented suspension tosses you around on all but the smoothest surfaces. "It requires a lot of corrections through bumpy corners quite a chore," associate road test editor Erick Ayapana said. Road test editor Chris Walton agreed: "The experience remains one of continual 'delay gain,' with unsure steering, tremendous turbo lag, and a 'Who knows what's going to happen next?' feeling most of the time." There's still something to love, though. Once the STI's excessive drive and center-differential settings have been dialed in properly, the Type RA actively rewards you with a death grip of the road. Between the beefy all-wheel-drive system and Stickum-coated tires, the Subie feels like it never wants to let go. Getting those settings sorted to your driving style is tricky with inconsistent manners ranging from lethargic to pointy especially if you aim for the hardcore end of the scale. "It's like when you were 15 and got your first electric guitar," Evans said. "The first thing you did was crank the gain on the amplifier to 11 because you wanted to play metal. Then you hit that first power chord and scared everyone in the house." To steal Evans' analogy, the Subaru's electronics reminds me of an old guitar amp I had in high school. It had hundreds of effects it could replicate. I ended up selling it for a single-channel Marshall half-stack. Keep it simple, Subaru. We'd be happy with two or three drive settings. Despite the sensory overload the Subaru delivers on the road, it didn't quite translate once our test gear was hooked up. Lined up at the drag strip, the Type RA accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds, tied for slowest in the group, and went through the quarter mile in 14.0 seconds at 100.8 mph, a half second slower than our leader. Its braking performance, 60-0 mph in 103 feet, was second best, but its figure-eight lap was almost a half second behind the leaders. The Type RA's 24.7-second at 0.77 g average lap is impressive in a vacuum, but it's still only a tenth of a second quicker than the much softer Golf R. Its Streets of Willow lap wasn't as fast as we expected, either, for a car featuring a carbon roof and spoiler. Randy's best lap was 1:27.56 just a hair ahead of the VW . Randy liked the Type RA's brakes and shocks but was annoyed by the laggy engine and its handling balance. "Even though we had the center diff in Auto-, the Subaru still had quite a bit of understeer," Pobst said. "I'm frustrated with Subaru because they're too conservative with their handling balance. The RA has a wing on it, and it looks all radical, but this isn't. It's pushy." The WRX STI might be the car directly responsible for kicking off the sport compact segment, but somewhere along the way it lost that little bit of sparkle. The Type RA both looks and feels racy, but it doesn't have the performance to back it up. Even more important: This Subaru is just simply not as fun to drive as it is to look at. Third Place: Volkswagen Golf R The grown-up in the room If flying under the radar is your thing, it's tough to beat the 2018 Volkswagen Golf R. Lacking the tacked-on bodywork and rear wing of the Ford, Honda , and Subaru, the only tell that this unassuming Golf packs 292 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque underhood is a subtle "R" badge and four fat exhaust tips poking out from its rear bumper. Otherwise this six-speed-manual-equipped (a seven-speed twin-clutch auto is available), all-wheel-drive hatch is the ultimate sleeper perfect for convincing your new boss you're an upstanding member of society while ensuring your college buddies know you're still the same guy they played Edward Fortyhands with. All for a fairly reasonable $40,635. Despite its sleeper status not to mention its horsepower and weight disadvantage the Golf R has no trouble chasing down the rest of the pack on Mulholland Highway. "I was surprised I was keeping up with Scott in the Focus he'd use the Ford's superior grip in the corners to pull away slightly, but I'd reel him in at the exit and on the straights," Walton said. The Golf R doesn't feel as outright powerful as the rest of the group, but it delivers its power smoothly and linearly, without much turbo lag. The gearbox has light, accurate throws, though the pedals are too widely spaced to heel-toe downshift for some. The Golf goes around a corner with delicate, precise steering and near-invisible all-wheel drive or electronic intervention. The Golf R's curb weight is certainly noticeable, but as Ayapana said, "It's still predictable, balanced, and fun." Unfortunately, the Golf R's refined road manners don't translate to the track. With its power-to-weight ratio working against it, the Golf R brought up the rear in nearly all of our instrumented tests. Its best 0-60 run was 5.7 seconds, tied with the WRX STI, and it finished the quarter mile in 14.1 seconds at 100.4 mph. Its 107-foot 60-0 stop was good for bronze, but it couldn't make up the gap in the figure eight, where it lapped the course in 24.8 seconds at a 0.77 g average. Not that it's a bad thing. "It's rather shocking that the Golf R's lap was just 0.1 second behind the Subaru around the figure eight because it was so much less taxing," Walton said. "It felt like a nice drive, not an assault." When it came to its 1:27.90 hot lap, Pobst was frustrated by the Golf R's softness. "The ride and handling engineers need to have less influence on this car," he said. "It has a lot of understeer. Especially under power, it understeers like a front-drive car." Although we all agreed that the Golf R was fun to drive on the street, its result at the track left us feeling cold. The top two finishers proved to be more engaging on the street and at the track, too. Second Place: Ford Focus RS Better late than never Subaru and Mitsubishi were the darlings of the '90s hot-hatch movement, but Ford was rallying around the Acropolis ages before. And Ford still knows the formula. Turbo four-cylinder? Check. All-wheel drive? Check. Charmingly obnoxious bodywork? Check. Part of a limited edition run of 1,500 for the RS' last model year (1,000 for the U.S.A., 500 for Canada), the 2018 model is the best yet. Its 2.3-liter turbo I-4 cranks out 350 hp and 350 lb-ft and sends its power through a six-speed manual to a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system now equipped with a limited-slip front differential. The RS also benefits from changes Ford made to the series last year, chiefly a less punishing electronic suspension setup. Our tester stickered for $41,995. "I give Ford a lot of credit here," Evans said. "The improvements to the RS are real and substantial. It's much more streetable than it used to be." Whereas the multiple 2016 Focus RS models we tested (note: we never got into a 2017 model) rode like trucks and tramlined over the road, the 2018 model finally feels dialed in. That's not to say the Focus RS has gone soft. The ride is still firm (especially in the suspension's Sport setting), but it's no longer a kidney-bruising affair. With the body well managed, it lets the driver focus on more important things like the tiny terror under the hood. The power the Focus RS' 2.3-liter engine makes is unbelievable; there's a touch of lag as you accelerate, but once boost hits, you're off like a Falcon 9 rocket, with a matching soundtrack to boot. The gearbox carries widely spaced ratios, making it easy to string quick-succession corners together in second or third gear or lope down the freeway in sixth. The pedals are difficult to heel-toe in everyday situations because they don't lie on the same plane, but they're "perfect when you're hammering the car and deep in the brake pedal," Evans said. The Focus RS' steering is quick and precise, and the all-wheel-drive system doesn't push as you go into corners. And thanks to that limited-slip front diff, it puts down power exceptionally well as you rocket out of a corner onto straights. Not surprising with 350 horsepower on tap and an aggressive all-wheel-drive setup, the Focus RS is the quickest car here on the drag strip; it accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and runs the quarter mile in 13.5 seconds at 101.2 mph. The Focus RS is a bit underbraked, needing 109 feet in our 60-0 stopping test, but that didn't seem to hurt its figure-eight lap, tied for first at 24.3 seconds at 0.79 g. The Focus RS is notably fun on the figure eight in Track mode with stability control disabled. "Glorious on corner exit whacking the throttle to the floor three-quarters of the way through the corner puts the Focus into a beautiful, controlled drift every single time," Walton said. "With a dab of oppo, it's super controllable and a hoot." Who needs Drift mode? With Pobst behind the wheel, the Focus RS turned a 1:26.56 lap of Streets of Willow, just more than a second slower than our leader. Pobst said the Focus RS' greatest advantage was its grip under power, but he complained of too much ABS intervention: "A couple times I overran corners because I got a lot of ABS and it wouldn't slow down or turn." Despite its few flaws, you're left with the impression that the Focus RS is built purely around the idea of fun. With gimmicks like Drift mode backed by face-melting performance, the 2018 Focus RS finally delivers on what the original promised. Unfortunately for Ford, there's one car that does it better. First Place: Honda Civic Type R R U kidding me? The 2018 Honda Civic Type R is easy to dismiss on paper. Its 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 makes "only" 306 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, about average for the segment. And what criminal would send that power to only the front wheels? That would've been considered heresy back when I was a kid, but Honda has good reason: Front-drive with a limited-slip differential keeps both weight and the center of gravity low, with the ultimate aim of making it more fun to drive. It also makes the Type R cheaper. Its $34,990 as-tested price is the lowest of our four. Despite the lack of all-wheel drive, the Civic Type R certainly looks like it belongs. The Gundam styling features a wide variety of functional aero add-ons, such as a massive rear wing and hood scoop which, fun fact, cools the computers that run the Type R's electronic adaptive suspension, not the engine and embellishments such as red accents and three center-mounted exhaust outlets. Its styling is certainly more polarizing than our other three pocket rockets; I love it, but Evans said the Type R "screams 20-something asshat." Hi there! Despite Evans' (or my) lack of taste, there's no denying that this car can scoot. It makes everything feel absolutely effortless natural even. The Civic's Ohio-built engine is a little monster; it makes linear power off the line before finding a second wind as it blasts from 3,000 rpm to its redline. The clutch and six-speed manual action are also best in our test. "This might be the goldilocks of the group; it just does everything well," Walton said. "I learned where the power lived it comes on strong just over 3,000 rpm and gets better from there and used it to my advantage." As enthusiasts, we're conditioned to expect both torque steer and understeer from powerful front-drive cars like the Civic Type R, but Honda's engineers likely sold their souls as neither exists here. The Honda's steering is light, quick, and accurate. Yet its ride is commute-friendly. "What impressed me most in the canyons was its balance," Ayapana said. "Just when you expect understeer, the Civic Type R says, 'Nope, not today,' and stays neutral." Equally impressive at our test track, the uncivil Civic accelerated from 0 to 60 in 5.0 seconds and finished the quarter in 13.7 seconds at 105.9 mph, second to the Ford. Even more impressive is the Type R's acceleration numbers after 60 mph; from 0 to 70 through 100 mph, the Type R was the quickest car of the group. The Honda stopped shorter than any other car in our test, too, needing 99 feet to stop from 60 mph, and it tied the Focus RS' 24.3-second figure-eight lap and its 0.79 g average. Although the Type R didn't cleanly break free from the Ford at our test track, it blasted the Focus at Streets. Pobst's 1:25.45 lap was not only the fastest of the day, but it also makes the Honda the quickest front-drive car we've ever had around the track. "The Civic feels the raciest of this group," he said. "It's a bit of a wild child, but it's a very stable car. It's really hard to get the tail out, but at the same time it doesn't have as much understeer as the Subaru or Golf. It's so interesting. How do they do that?" The Civic Type R's performance merits are certainly enough for it to earn first place fair and square. More than that, it never fails to make you smile. Of all the cars here, the Civic Type R is the one we most want to drive, just because. It's the type of car where you're actively looking for an excuse to run an errand or head out on a road trip. It's as rewarding to drive at 25 mph puttering around town as it is carving up your favorite back road or racetrack. It's the car you shift for no reason other than it feels good doing it. It's the car you race from every stop sign because it's fun and take around every corner as fast as you dare because of its thrilling feedback. If I could send this story back in time and put it in the hands of my 12-year-old self, I'm sure I wouldn't believe the results. But the Honda Civic Type R isn't just a driver's car. It's a driving partner. And for that, it's our unanimous pick for the winner. 4th Place: 2018 Subaru WRX STI Type RA Rough and tumble Type RA promises much but doesn't deliver the goods Research the Subaru WRX STI on MSN Autos | Find a Subaru WRX STI Type RA near you 3rd Place: 2018 Volkswagen Golf R Soft and heavy at the track but an exceptional long-haul cruiser Research the Volkswagen Golf R on MSN Autos | Find a Volkswagen Golf R near you 2nd Place: 2018 Ford Focus RS Ford finally delivers the Focus RS we've always wanted just in time for it to go out of production Research the Ford Focus on MSN Autos | Find a Ford Focus RS near you 1st Place: 2018 Honda Civic Type R Honda's twist on the sport compact creates the new world-standard hot hatch Research the Honda Civic Hatchback on MSN Autos | Find a Honda Civic Type R near you Horses for Courses Sometimes the category of car we're lapping and the available track don't quite match. Either the cars are too powerful for the track, or the track's too fast for the cars. Not here, though. Our quartet of cars couldn't be better tailored for the Streets of Willow Springs. Unfortunately, that still left us with some head-scratching inconsistencies. Sure, there are a couple of obvious trends. The Civic Type R repeatedly out-accelerates the other three and usually gets a jump out of the corners, too, due to its edge in grip. But when we lean in closer well, there are often differences without patterns. For instance, the Civic shows a lot of confidence through Turn 7, but Randy Pobst isn't nearly as bold as he lifts nearing the braking points for Turn 1 and 11. The Golf shows a lack of commitment at all three of these points, though it's solidly midpack in cornering grip. The Focus is uniquely quick through Turn 5 but nowhere else. What is consistent? Perhaps the Subaru, which usually had the lowest cornering speeds and peak speeds between corner except for its anomalous spurt of speed between Turns 3 and 4   Kim Reynolds 2018 Subaru WRX STI Type RA 2018 Volkswagen Golf R 2018 Ford Focus RS 2018 Honda Civic Type R DRIVETRAIN LAYOUT Front-engine, AWD Front-engine, AWD Front-engine, AWD Front-engine, FWD ENGINE TYPE Turbocharged flat-4, alum block/heads Turbocharged I-4, iron block/alum head Turbocharged I-4, alum block/head Turbocharged I-4, alum block/head VALVETRAIN DOHC, 4 valves/cyl DOHC, 4 valves/cyl DOHC, 4 valves/cyl DOHC, 4 valves/cyl DISPLACEMENT 150.2 cu in/2,462cc 121.1 cu in/1,984 cc 138.0 cu in/2,261 cc 121.8 cu in/1,996 cc COMPRESSION RATIO 8.1:1 9.6:1 9.5:1 9.8:1 POWER (SAE NET) 305 hp @ 6,000 rpm 292 hp @ 5,400 rpm 350 hp @ 6,000 rpm 306 hp @ 6,500 rpm TORQUE (SAE NET) 290 lb-ft @ 4,000 rpm 280 lb-ft @ 1,800 rpm 350 lb-ft @ 3,200 rpm 295 lb-ft @ 2,500 rpm REDLINE 6,600 rpm 6,500 rpm 6,500 rpm 7,000 rpm WEIGHT TO POWER 11.1 lb/hp 11.4 lb/hp 9.8 lb/hp 10.1 lb/hp TRANSMISSION 6-speed manual 6-speed manual 6-speed manual 6-speed manual AXLE/FINAL-DRIVE RATIO 3.90:1/2.95:1 4.24:1 (1st, 2nd) 3.27:1 (3rd-6th, R)/2.98:1 4.06:1 (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th); 2.95:1 (5th, 6th, R)/2.77:1 4.11:1/3.02:1 SUSPENSION, FRONT; REAR Struts, coil springs, anti-roll bar; multi-link, coil springs, anti-roll bar Struts, coil springs, anti-roll bar; multilink, coil springs, anti-roll bar Struts, coil springs, adj shocks, anti-roll bar; control arms, coil springs, adj shocks, anti-roll bar Struts, coil springs, adj shocks; anti-roll bar; multilink, coil springs, adj shocks; anti-roll bar STEERING RATIO 13.3:1 9.5-14.1:1 15.0:1 14.9-11.7:1 TURNS LOCK-TO-LOCK 2.5 2.1 2.0 2.1 BRAKES, F; R 13.4-in vented, drilled disc; 12.8-in vented, drilled disc, ABS 13.4-in vented disc; 12.2-in vented disc, ABS 13.8-in vented disc; 11.9-in vented disc, ABS 13.8-in vented, drilled disc; 12.0-in disc, ABS WHEELS 8.5 x 19-in forged aluminum 8.0 x 19-in cast aluminum 8.0 x 19-in forged aluminum 8.5 x 20-in cast aluminum TIRES 245/35R19 89W Yokohama Advan Sport V105 235/35R19 91Y Continental ContiSportContact 5P 235/35R19 91Y Michelin Pilot Super Sport 245/30R20 90Y Continental SportContact 6 DIMENSIONS WHEELBASE 104.3 in 103.5 in 104.3 in 106.3 in TRACK, F/R 60.2/60.6 in 60.7/59.7 in 60.9/60.0 in 63.0/62.7 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 181.3 x 70.7 x 58.1 in 168.4 x 70.8 x 56.5 in 171.7 x 74.1 x 58.0 in 179.4 x 73.9 56.5 in TURNING CIRCLE 36.0 ft 35.8 ft 39.4 ft 39.5 ft CURB WEIGHT 3,380 lb 3,325 lb 3,430 lb 3,096 lb WEIGHT DIST, F/R 60/40% 59/41% 59/41% 62/38% SEATING CAPACITY 5 5 5 4 HEADROOM, F/R 39.8/37.1 in 38.4/38.1 in 38.3/38.0 in 39.3/37.4 in LEGROOM, F/R 43.3/35.4 in 41.2/35.6 in 43.1/33.2 in 42.3/35.9 in SHOULDER ROOM, F/R 55.6/54.6 in 55.9/53.9 in 55.6/52.6 in 56.9/55.0 in CARGO VOLUME 12.0 cu ft 52.7/22.8 cu ft 36.9/19.9 cu ft 46.3/25.7 cu ft TEST DATA ACCELERATION TO MPH 0-30 1.7 sec 1.8 sec 1.5 sec 2.1 sec 0-40 3.0 3.1 2.6 3.2 0-50 4.0 4.1 3.6 4.0 0-60 5.7 5.7 4.7 5.0 0-70 7.1 7.3 6.7 6.6 0-80 9.3 9.4 8.2 8.0 0-90 11.4 11.7 10.3 10.2 0-100 13.8 14.0 13.2 12.2 PASSING, 45-65 MPH 2.9 3.0 2.8 2.4 QUARTER MILE 14.0 sec @ 100.8 mph 14.1 sec @ 100.4 mph 13.5 sec @ 101.2 mph 13.7 sec @ 105.9 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 103 ft 107 ft 109 ft 99 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.98 g (avg) 0.97 g (avg) 1.01 g (avg) 1.01 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 24.7 sec @ 0.77 g (avg) 24.8 sec @ 0.77 g (avg) 24.3 sec @ 0.79 g (avg) 24.3 sec @ 0.79 g (avg) 1.6-MI ROAD COURSE LAP 87.56 sec 87.90 sec 86.56 sec 85.45 sec TOP-GEAR REVS @ 60 MPH 2,400 rpm 2,250 rpm 2,250 rpm 2,450 rpm CONSUMER INFO BASE PRICE $49,855 $40,635 $41,995 $34,990 PRICE AS TESTED $49,855 $40,635 $41,995 $34,990 STABILITY/TRACTION CONTROL Yes/Yes Yes/Yes Yes/Yes Yes/Yes AIRBAGS 7: Dual front, front side, f/r curtain, driver knee 6: Dual front, front side, f/r curtain 7: Dual front, front side, f/r curtain, driver knee 6: Dual front, front side, f/r curtain BASIC WARRANTY 3 yrs/36,000 miles 6 yrs/72,000 miles 3 yrs/36,000 miles 3 yrs/36,000 miles POWERTRAIN WARRANTY 5 yrs/60,000 miles 6 yrs/72,000 miles 5 yrs/60,000 miles 5 yrs/60,000 miles ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE 3 yrs/36,000 miles 3 yrs/36,000 miles 5 yrs/60,000 miles 3 yrs/36,000 miles FUEL CAPACITY 15.9 gal 14.5 gal 13.7 gal 12.4 gal EPA CITY/HWY/COMB ECON 16/22/18 mpg 21/29/24 mpg 19/26/22 mpg 22/28/25 mpg ENERGY CONS, CITY/HWY 211/153 kW-hrs/100 miles 160/116 kW-hrs/100 miles 177/130 kW-hrs/100 miles 153/120 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS, COMB 1.06 lb/mile 0.81 lb/mile 0.90 lb/mile 0.80 lb/mile RECOMMENDED FUEL Unleaded premium Unleaded premium Unleaded premium Unleaded premium Follow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter

BBV1ppM	health	medical	Worst states for health care	Stacker ranked the worst 25 states for health care in the U.S. based on data from a 2018 WalletHub survey.	Stacker ranked the worst 25 states for health care in the U.S. based on data from a 2018 WalletHub survey. Worst states for health care The average American spends more than $10,000 on health care each year, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But that money isn't necessarily going toward high-quality care. There are stories of patients going in for routine appointments or procedures, only to receive bills later for thousands of dollars; horror stories of surgeries gone wrong; and even a spate of violence against health care workers, with shootings inside hospitals and assaults on nurses. The state of health care in the United States is in constant flux, making it difficult to know just where the country or individual states stand. Meanwhile, health care costs are prohibitive for many people; which can lead to undiagnosed and unaddressed illnesses or injuries that only get worse. To take a closer look at how individual states compare when it comes to health care, Stacker gathered data from a WalletHub analysis (data from Aug. 5, 2019). The WalletHub rankings were created by scoring various health care factors related to cost, access, and outcomes in each state as well as surveying health care experts about topics that included insurers, health care reform, and expenditures. Measuring cost included factors such as the cost of visiting a doctor and average monthly premiums, while access rankings looked at the quality of the public hospital system, the number of doctors per person, and Medicare acceptance rates. Ranking medical outcomes was a measure of mortality, cancer rate, and non-immunized children. How each state scored in terms of cost, access, and outcomes determined its total score. WalletHub evaluated the results for each state across cost, access, and outcomes based on a 40-metric, weighted system with corresponding points based on a 100-point scale. A score of 100 indicated top-notch health care at the best value. The following 25 states hit the bottom of the list and are ranked in this gallery from bad to most severe. Does your home state fall on this list? Click through the slide show above to find out. You may also like: Best states for health care #25. Wyoming - Health care score: 52.14 - Cost rank: #36 - Access rank: #37 - Outcomes rank: #16 Bryce Habel is a former Shopko pharmacist in Wyoming. Every day, he drives an 80-mile loop around his county, delivering medication to those who lost the only nearby pharmacy when Shopko went out of business. It's bad news for the state, which already has the second-least amount of physicians per capita. #24. Idaho - Health care score: 52.02 - Cost rank: #30 - Access rank: #43 - Outcomes rank: #19 There's a problem with uncompensated care in Idaho, costs not paid back by the state when uninsured people are treated at the emergency room. In 2017 alone, hospitals in the state lost $294 million due to this, according to the Idaho State Journal. Medicaid expansion may help; but whether it will also help increase the low amount of hospital beds, physicians, and dentists in the state is yet to be seen. #23. Delaware - Health care score: 51.79 - Cost rank: #42 - Access rank: #27 - Outcomes rank: #21 Despite most adult Delawareans keeping up with regular doctor visits, the state still battles with high cancer and infant mortality rates . One issue Delaware is currently facing is "clawbacks," where insurance companies are allowed to charge patients a higher copay at the pharmacy than the cost of their prescriptions. #22. California - Health care score: 51.19 - Cost rank: #39 - Access rank: #42 - Outcomes rank: #20 Although California has one of the lowest heart disease rates and one of the highest amounts of dentists per capita, the state is still in the midst of a health care crisis. It's said to be expensive and difficult to get, which isn't surprising about 7 million residents live in official Health Professional Shortage Areas. #21. New Mexico - Health care score: 50.95 - Cost rank: #19 - Access rank: #31 - Outcomes rank: #36 New Mexico has some of the lowest average monthly insurance premiums in the country but don't let the ranking there fool you. The state is also struggling with incredibly high deductibles, forcing people to skip critical care. New Mexico is also expected to be in the top 10 states with doctor shortages by 2030.

Washington - Health care score: 49.85 - Cost rank: #48 - Access rank: #44 - Outcomes rank: #11 If you think nature is the best cure, head to Washington state; health care providers there are teaming up with Washington State Parks and the nonprofit Park Rx America to prescribe time in nature as part of a care plan. The state's Veterans Affairs office is partaking, noting that time outdoors helps PTSD. It is hoped this initiative will bring more people to the doctor Washington has the second-highest percentage of at-risk adults who haven't seen a doctor in the last two years. #19. Oregon - Health care score: 49.43 - Cost rank: #49 - Access rank: #29 - Outcomes rank: #15 For trans people, Oregon is one of the best states for health. The low-income Oregon Health Plan covers hormone therapy and surgeries, and Oregon Health & Science University has a Transgender Health Program for those not on the state plan. The state faces some challenges, though: costs are rising, leadership is in flux, and the state is among those with the fewest hospital beds per capita in the country. #18. Indiana - Health care score: 49.29 - Cost rank: #9 - Access rank: #38 - Outcomes rank: #40 Amid the recent national measles outbreak, Indiana is taking a stand and offering vaccinations without a prescription. Health officials released the order after just one confirmed case of measles in the state. #17. Kentucky - Health care score: 49.11 - Cost rank: #16 - Access rank: #14 - Outcomes rank: #47 Kentucky is facing a trifecta of health ailments. The state has the highest cancer rate in the country, the second-highest heart disease rate, and one of the highest rates of stroke-related deaths. It's also one of the top 10 states for opioid deaths  something the medical community there is coming together to help solve. #16. Tennessee - Health care score: 48.05 - Cost rank: #18 - Access rank: #32 - Outcomes rank: #42 Residents in Tennessee are dealing with some unfortunate revelations in their health care system recently. In late 2019, the state became the first to request a Medicaid block grant, which could impact coverage for low-income people. Also, eight health care providers were recently busted for opioid trafficking. You may also like: Most and least healthy states in America #15. Missouri - Health care score: 47.5 - Cost rank: #31 - Access rank: #25 - Outcomes rank: #41 Children in Missouri are quickly becoming one of the largest groups of those affected by subpar health care in the state. In the last year, child suicide rates have grown, along with rates of children being pushed out of Medicaid thanks to an unnecessarily difficult re-enrollment process. #14. Nevada - Health care score: 47.37 - Cost rank: #22 - Access rank: #47 - Outcomes rank: #39 Nevada has the lowest cancer rate of all the states , which is notable. Unfortunately, the state is a problem area for health care workplace violence. A bill introduced in March works to combat the issue. #13. Florida - Health care score: 47.37 - Cost rank: #34 - Access rank: #46 - Outcomes rank: #35 Since the 1970s, Florida has been facing low rates of insured patients and it still does, ranking in the bottom five for both children and adults. But that may change with a new bill currently on its way through the governor's desk. The bill overturns Certificate of Need regulations, which meant new services or expansion by outpatient facilities had to get state approval first, something that often reduced access to care and inflated prices. #12. West Virginia - Health care score: 47.35 - Cost rank: #41 - Access rank: #7 - Outcomes rank: #45 West Virginia has some of the highest insurance premiums, but also ranks as having some of the most hospital beds per capita but it also has a major opioid problem and high expenses. To that end, a group of hospitals in the state are suing opioid firms, blaming false marketing for fueling the problems. #11. Arizona - Health care score: 46.74 - Cost rank: #37 - Access rank: #48 - Outcomes rank: #34 Arizona may be nearing the bottom of the good health care list, but it's also considered a great place for nurses . Prospective nurses are won over by high levels of opportunity and competition, a high salary, and high rates of job growth. But there aren't many job openings, likely due to a lack of health care facilities overall per capita. You may also like: States with the highest and lowest rates of obesity #10. Alabama - Health care score: 46.59 - Cost rank: #12 - Access rank: #45 - Outcomes rank: #46 Alabama has some of the highest heart disease rates in the country and is among the states with the fewest dentists but the state has at least one thing going for it: There hasn't been a single confirmed case of measles all year. And that's after someone confirmed to have the illness traveled there in April. #9. Texas - Health care score: 45.94 - Cost rank: #28 - Access rank: #51 - Outcomes rank: #38 Texas has some of the lowest rates of insured people  the lowest overall for adults age 18 to 64, and almost last for children from birth to age 17. The state Legislature is working to improve health care in Texas, though, introducing bills covering everything from raising the minimum age to buy cigarettes to extending the length of covered behavioral health services after someone gives birth . #8. Louisiana - Health care score: 44.5 - Cost rank: #33 - Access rank: #20 - Outcomes rank: #49 Louisiana is facing numerous health care issues: the least amount of people seeing a dentist, high infant mortality rates, and overall the worst health care ratings in the country. To raise that ranking, the state is hoping to raise the smoking age to 21 and also recently broke ground on a new biomedical research facility. #7. Oklahoma - Health care score: 44.47 - Cost rank: #26 - Access rank: #39 - Outcomes rank: #48 With one of the highest percentages of adults who haven't seen a dentist, one of the lowest percentages of insured adults, and some of the highest monthly insurance premiums, Oklahoma has a long way to go to secure proper health care for its residents. The state is making strides in the right direction, though, by recommending a measles vaccine. #6. Georgia - Health care score: 44.45 - Cost rank: #23 - Access rank: #49 - Outcomes rank: #44 In April, Georgia lawmakers signed the Patients First Act, a bill that's designed to make it easier for uninsured and underinsured residents to get access to health care. It's a good time for it, too Georgia ranks as one of the states with the lowest numbers of insured adults. You may also like: 25 terms you should know to understand the health care debate #5. Arkansas - Health care score: 43.48 - Cost rank: #20 - Access rank: #33 - Outcomes rank: #50 Arkansas unfortunately beats all other states for risk of heart disease, as well as having some of the most adults who haven't been to the dentist and a high infant mortality rate. The state does, though, have a high rate of available hospital beds. A new mobile health unit now travels throughout Arkansas offering free health screenings. #4. South Carolina - Health care score: 42.96 - Cost rank: #46 - Access rank: #40 - Outcomes rank: #43 A recent Winthrop University survey offers some insight on South Carolina's poor state of health care. Most residents report they would support a government-owned national health plan as long as they had the option to keep their regular insurance plans. #3. Mississippi - Health care score: 42.76 - Cost rank: #27 - Access rank: #28 - Outcomes rank: #51 Even though Mississippi has the second-most hospital beds per capita, the state ranks low on the amount of available physicians and dentists, insured adults, and people who see a dentist regularly. Coupled with high infant death rates and high heart disease rates, that leaves the state of health care in a bad situation. Many of the state's rural hospitals are at risk of closing, as well. #2. North Carolina - Health care score: 42.63 - Cost rank: #50 - Access rank: #50 - Outcomes rank: #33 Low insurance access rates plague North Carolina's health care system, but lawmakers are trying to change that. The NC Health Care for Working Families Act would increase access for low-income residents. The proposal would cover more than 540,000 people who lacked insurance before. #1. Alaska - Health care score: 42.21 - Cost rank: #51 - Access rank: #26 - Outcomes rank: #31 Among other states, Alaska is vying to be one of the first to get the Medicaid block grant. It could hurt the state's health care environment, though, with cuts to some services people use. Insurance premiums in the state are already low (and so is heart disease risk), but Alaska also has the least amount of covered children. You may also like: Best states for health care

BBJTQ6I	foodanddrink	foodculture	Why Do We Add Eggs To Cake Mixes?		Here's the wacky reason your Betty Crocker pantry staple is missing one key ingredient. Halfway To Homemade? Nothing compares to a homemade cake, but sometimes, we just don't have the time! That's where boxed cake mixes come in to save the day. Without the hassle of buying extra ingredients or trying to get the measurements just right, cake mix makes for an effortless dessert. Nowadays, it only seems natural to whip in an egg just before popping it into the oven   but this wasn't always the case! Read more to find out what cake mixes were like before and why they changed. The Original Cake Mix Betty Crocker cake mixes first hit the shelves in the 1950s, a time when convenience foods were "the next big thing." They already contained all the ingredients, including powdered milk and dried eggs   you only needed to add water! With thousands of homemakers across America looking for ways to save time in the kitchen, companies like General Mills and Pillsbury thought they were sitting on a windfall. But in spite of the many attractive benefits, boxed cake mixes just weren't selling well. Where did they go wrong? The Psychology General Mills eventually hired a team of psychologists to get down to the core of the problem. Boxed cake mixes weren't selling due to one powerful emotion: guilt. When you think about it, making a cake is a labor of love. Often, you're making it for a loved one's birthday or to share with your children. For many bakers at the time, using pre-prepared batters was no better than cheating. The Solution In order to put a more "homemade" spin on cake mixes, General Mills decided to make the products less convenient. That means subtracting the egg, leaving us with a bit more work to do. Lo and behold, sales skyrocketed! Despite the added effort, the simple act of whipping an egg gave us the sense that the dessert came from the heart (and not from a box). And that's what makes Betty Crocker all the more delicious!

Life goes by too fast to not wear the bathing suit, make the memories, take the trip, be in pictures, or have fun because you think you don't look "good enough". Be confident, you're beautiful and I promise you are your own worst critic. I look at all women that are in bathing suits enjoying time with friends and loved ones with admiration! Don't be worried about what people think. And if people judge then that's their problem because their opinions literally have no value in your life. ????????? my bathing suit is from @aerie ???? #aeriereal A post shared by ?a d r i e n n e o s u n a?

BBL6AZc	health	voices	I Tried an Intense Metabolic Reset Program for a Month -- and It Worked	It was 30 days of hard work, bland food, and hulk juice -- but it ended with a six-pack.	It was 30 days of hard work, bland food, and hulk juice -- but it ended with a six-pack. No matter who you are or how disciplined your fitness routine, there will be times when you'll fall off the wagon. Once you've realized you're out of your typical flow, you can adjust your approach and hit the reset button. Last winter, I noticed just how much I was ordering food instead of opting for healthier options - every single day, and for almost every single meal. Even though I'm a fit, active, generally healthy individual, it was starting to make me feel gross. Thankfully, I'm far from the only person to feel this way. I've followed Steve Weatherford , former New York Giants punter and " fittest player in the NFL ", since he's transformed from a football player into a fitness trainer and coach. I noticed on his social media accounts that he'd recently gone through a similar experience himself. After his slump, he emerged with what he was calling a 30 Day Metabolic Reset - a program designed to improve your health, balance your gut, increase your energy, and help you lose fat and undigested foods in your body. The program had just launched, but it already had thousands of followers. "I didn't initially plan to share the program - I was doing it for myself," Weatherford explained in a phone interview with MensHealth.com . "Moving from New Jersey to southern California with four kids, a pregnant wife, a dog, etc., life was crazy and my diet sucked for six weeks. While we were waiting to get into our rental home, we ate every single meal out, and I just felt like crap. I wanted to look better, I wanted to function better, I wanted to feel better." Like Weatherford, I was feeling like crap and wanted to make a change to help make me function and feel better. My goal was to cut down on body fat, and after seeing that Weatherford was able to lose five percent, I decided to give the program a try. The Plan: Supplements and Nutrition Before I fully committed to the plan, I read through the program and realized there was a bit of prep I needed to do. First, I had to fill out a quick questionnaire about myself - age, weight, height, body type, activity level, etc., - that would help create the personalized nutrition plan (which Weatherford created with his friend and personal nutritionist Jason Phillips ). To follow the program to the letter, I would have to take a handful of supplements throughout the day. Weatherford doesn't say supplements are required in order to succeed, but explains that they worked for him and recommends using them if it works for your body. I spoke with Allen Tran , MS, RD, CSSD, high-performance dietician for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard teams to learn a bit more about exactly what I was being asked to put into my body. A handful of the supplements, like vitamin D, fish oil, digestive enzymes, and probiotics, could be obtained through food, and were on the "wellness side" of the supplements spectrum. "Many people have intolerances or can't balance their gut health, so these can help with that," Tran told me. "You don't need more than 100 percent of each vitamin, but lots of people don't always get a hundred from their environment or food alone." The other supplements like glutamine, BCAAs, kelp, CLA, and fat burners were on the "performance side" of the spectrum. Many of these supplements help preserve muscles when doing things like fasted cardio (which I'd be doing on this program), or aid in building muscle and enhancing metabolism, explained Tran. In the end, I got all except the fat burners, because I didn't feel they were necessary for me, and ZMA and magnesium, because I have zero sleeping issues (and didn't want to develop any). Weatherford sells the full stack on his website, but I got mine elsewhere. With a couple coupon codes and promotions, they weren't too pricey. Then it was time to check out the personalized nutrition plan. The program calls for a caloric deficit, meaning eating less calories than needed to maintain your current body weight, cycling between high, medium, and low carb days, focused on regimented macros. Translation: less protein than I was used to, barely any carbs, a lot of "hulk juice," (more on this later) and very plain, measured out meals. I'd never done a diet plan before that required measuring meals, so I was excited to go all in. I got a food scale and blender, then stocked up on the essentials - egg whites, chicken sausage, potatoes, ground turkey, jasmine rice, black beans, steak, asparagus, chicken, spinach, kale, apples, bananas, lemon, ginger, hot sauce, and mustard, which were all recommended for my food plan and the shopping list provided as a part of the program. I also ordered pre-made meals from an online service for clean eating. Unsurprisingly, there was no alcohol allowed. The program also requires you to drink one ounce of water for every pound of body weight. I kind of hate water, so I knew this would be a challenge. (Weatherford said seltzer was OK, so I stocked up on that as well.) Then came the hulk juice. After I signed up for the program, I was given three different videos recipes for hulk juice. The concoctions varied, but the basics are banana, apple, lemon juice, spinach, kale, and water. For the first week of the program, you replace your last meal (meal four) with hulk juice. Then after day seven, you add in meal four, and have hulk juice as a snack during the day. You can have as much of it as you want, though Weatherford cautions that it has a lot of natural sugar so don't over do it. The Plan: Cardio and Weight Training I read through the workout sections. I would be doing daily fasted cardio sessions first thing in the morning; that meant 30 minutes of continuous cardio of my choice at a heart rate range between 125 and 177 beats per minute (BPM), done on an empty stomach. This meant I could go for a run, run on the treadmill, walk on an incline, run hill sprints outside, jump rope, do burpess, create my own HIIT circuit, etc. Every day included a weight-training session in the afternoon. Every exercise in the workout had a corresponding video to check form, some of which you can find online . The program had a clever system to keep you on track. The only way to access workouts was to mark each one complete, which would "unlock" the following day's workout. You could still cheat in theory - but it would be a much more active decision to slack off. My 30-Day Metabolic Reset Journey WEEK 1 The first day of my journey came - and I was too hungover to begin the program. Great start, right? My boyfriend and I just wanted Chinese food and to be lazy all day, so we decided we'd start the following day. After the false start, we woke up, took before photos, and started fasted cardio. Here are the biggest takeaways from my first week: You have to drink so. Much. Water. An ounce of water per pound of bodyweight is even more than you think. I tried really hard to swallow my pride and down more H2O - but honestly, not one day of the plan did I drink the correct amount of water. I did, however, manage to I drink way more than I had before starting. I drank a full glass of water in the morning, at night, and during the workout, which helped. The workouts are tough, but you need to push yourself. From supersets, to giant sets, to HIIT, the workouts that Weatherford and his team created have a ton of variety. In order to get the most out of the workouts though, you need to really give it your all. Don't go into the gym tired and half-a*s it. Push yourself. The meals might seem light, but they keep you full. I was taken back by how small I thought the meals were at first, and how little protein I would be consuming. But the three meals plus the hulk juice kept me full throughout the day. I was never starving or hangry. It made me reconsider my protein intake, as I was used to 8-12 ounce portions before. WEEK 2 Weatherford's morning motivations became my morning caffeine. When my alarm would go off, I'd turn over, grab my phone, and check out my plan for the day. Along with a new workout, every morning had a video message from Steve. Some of them were really relatable, others - like going to the Super Bowl - were not, but they all had good takeaways and each one got me a little pumped up to get out of bed and start the day. Week 2 brought other lessons, which helped me hit a stride as the program became more of a routine. Stick to foods you enjoy. I don't like sweet potatoes - never have. I find them to be too sweet. But they were on the "suggested" meal plan so I bought them. I tried to like them - I ate them for a couple days - but I just couldn't do it. So I swapped them out for regular potatoes. Thankfully, the meal plan comes with a list of food swaps you can make for every category. This plan is already tough enough. Don't make it harder for yourself. Don't delay fasted cardio. It's difficult to get turned onto cardio everyday if you're not used to it. I found myself putting it off until two to three o'clock in the afternoon. It was to the point where I was starving but couldn't eat until I got it done, so I was just jumping rope and doing burpees around my apartment. WEEK 3 Condiments are a must. Even if you don't like sauces and dips, you'll gain a new appreciation for flavor for your bland meals. I ended up buying so many different types of mustards, wasabis, and spices to help make my food more tasty so I didn't get anymore bored of eating the same thing. You need gym access and tons of workout time. Even though fasted cardio is only 30 minutes, you still have to do it. Then you have to do a strength workout every day, too, which usually took between 45 minutes to an hour. You're dedicating about two hours to working out every day, which is time consuming. As a freelance writer, I was able to manipulate my schedule when necessary to fit in the workouts, but I know that my lifestyle isn't the norm. There's no denying that a program like this doesn't just take hard work and discipline - it requires a level of privilege to work, too. WEEK 4 The end was in sight. The meal plan and workouts were routine as this point, and I looked forward to it. Fasted cardio was a bit of a drag on some days, but keeping track of the countdown on my social media accounts got me excited and kept me accountable. Plus, it didn't hurt that I was looking great - my abs were really starting to show. You get out of a reset program what you put in. This program, and others like it, takes commitment. I didn't cheat a single meal or skip a single workout. I pushed myself in the gym and I measured out my meals. I put my full effort into doing the 30-day metabolic reset with all my effort and it truly paid off. After 30 days, I went from 117.3 pounds to 112.8 pounds, down 4.5 pounds. I went from 17.4 percent body fat to 12.7, down 4.7 percent. My arms, chest, back, shoulders and legs all got more muscular, lean, and toned. And the best part - I got a six-pack (which started showing the end of the second week). Don't believe me? A picture's worth a thousand words! Post-Program Takeaways After the 30 days, I was energized, my gut was in check, and I felt fit, happy, and healthy as a whole. While I couldn't wait to have my first cheat meal - which really was just chicken kabobs with all of the condiments and dipping sauces - doing this program has motivated me to change my lifestyle. There were some challenging drawbacks, though. You really can't eat out. You technically can grab a bite out somewhere, but you still don't know if they're really giving you plain chicken. So making all your own food is the best bet. That can be a pain. Your social life can disappear. My friend had her 30th birthday party during my reset month. I went, but I only lasted about 45 minutes before I'd had enough. Everyone else was drinking and I just felt out of place. A 30-day reset isn't really a sustainable lifestyle, which is why it's for a short, intense period of time. I'm not going to measure my food forever, but I'm a lot more aware of just how much protein I'm eating versus how much I actually need. That's just one of the lessons I've applied to my everyday life from my regimented month of intense fitness focus. I got the results I wanted - but it took a hell of a lot of work.

AAAOIxS	music	music-gallery	Artists With the Most No. 1 Hits	Releasing a No.	Releasing a No. Releasing a No. 1 hit song is a dream for all musicians working in popular music. And while tens of thousands of songs have charted on the Billboard Hot 100 -- the music industry's standard chart for popular singles -- since its inception in 1958, fewer than 700 unique artists have managed to reach the coveted No. 1 position. To send multiple singles to the top of the charts is even more rare. In fact, only 28 artists have managed to have more than four singles reach the No. 1 spot in the history of the Hot 100. These performers generally have careers that span decades -- producing high quality music that appeals to music fans again and again throughout the years -- making them the opposite of a one-hit wonder . 24/7 Tempo has identified the artists with the most No. 1 hits based on Billboard Hot 100 chart rankings going back to 1958. All of the artists who appear on the list are recognizable, as are their extensive catalogs of chart-topping music.

Eagles > No. 1 hits: 5 > Total weeks at No. 1: 5 > First chart topper: Best Of My Love (3/1/1975) The Eagles' greatest hits album is the highest certified album of all time, meaning recognized sales and streams of the album are higher than any other. The band has also had success on the pop charts, with five songs reaching No. 1 in the 1970s, although each of those singles held the position for one week only. 27. KC And The Sunshine Band > No. 1 hits: 5 > Total weeks at No. 1: 6 > First chart topper: Get Down Tonight (8/30/1975) Disco and funk outfit KC and the Sunshine Band had huge success during the 1970s with singles such as "That's The Way (I Like It)." Their final No. 1 was the love ballad "Please Don't Go," which peaked in 1980. ALSO READ: Biggest One-Hit Wonders of All Time 26. Lionel Richie > No. 1 hits: 5 > Total weeks at No. 1: 12 > First chart topper: Truly (11/27/1982) Lionel Richie had a hugely successful solo career after leaving The Commodores in 1982. Prior to his departure he had one chart-topping hit without the group, "Endless Love," which he performed as a duet with Diana Ross. 25. The Four Seasons > No. 1 hits: 5 > Total weeks at No. 1: 16 > First chart topper: Sherry (9/15/1962) The Four Seasons, also frequently referred to as Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, released four No. 1 hits during the first half of the 1960s. Their final No. 1 hit -- which peaked in 1976 -- was named for that period: "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)." ALSO READ: Most Famous Musician Born the Year You Were Born 24. Bruno Mars > No. 1 hits: 5 > Total weeks at No. 1: 16 > First chart topper: Just The Way You Are (10/2/2010) Bruno Mars scored four No. 1 hits of his first two studio albums: "Just the Way You Are," "Grenade," "Locked Out of Heaven," and "When I Was Your Man." In 2017, he had another major hit with "That's What I Like," which spent 52 total weeks on the Hot 100 but only one week in the top position. 23. Taylor Swift > No. 1 hits: 5 > Total weeks at No. 1: 17 > First chart topper: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (9/1/2012) Twenty-nine-year old pop sensation Taylor Swift is the youngest artist to currently have released at least five No. 1 hits on the Hot 100. Swift's song "Blank Space" spent the most time in the top position, at seven weeks, beginning in November 2014. ALSO READ: Rappers With the Most Hits 22.

BBMTKyQ	news	newsus	Meet the table busser who's worked at the same pancake house for 54 years, and still makes minimum wage	Meet the table busser who's worked at the same pancake house for 54 years, and still makes minimum wage	WILMETTE, Ill. -Othea Loggan came to Chicago and got a job bussing tables and washing dishes at Walker Bros. Original Pancake House in Wilmette. One of his brothers-in-law was the chef. Loggan lived on the South Side but he didn't mind the long, early morning commute to the North Shore, clear across downtown Chicago and Cook County. He was just happy to be free of Mississippi, where he had grown up poor, one of 10 kids. Walker Bros. was relatively new then, and a fast success, establishing itself in less than four years as a breakfast staple for businessmen from Glencoe and hung-over graduate students from Northwestern alike. Loggan himself had been in Chicago only two weeks. He started March 30, 1964. "The Outer Limits" was on TV that night. The No. 1 song was "She Loves You," by The Beatles. The battle of the Gulf of Tonkin, which cemented the United States in Vietnam, was six months away. And two weeks earlier, Lyndon Johnson, new to the Oval Office, proposed to Congress the first War on Poverty. Loggan's starting salary was $1.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage, but enough, he recalls now, to save up and buy a small house, if you got lucky. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, roughly 40 percent of Americans in the early 1960s stayed in a job for 10 years or longer. Loggan never really intended to stay that long. He was only 18. He didn't really have plans. On a muggy July morning, Othea Loggan walked into the kitchen at Walker Bros. Original Pancake House. He arrived as he had for decades, through a side door, at 5:50 a.m., a headlong wave of motion among a staff still getting adjusted to the hour. The president was Donald Trump, the No. 1 song in the country was "Nice For What" by Drake, and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average job tenure in the United States was just four years. Or, if you worked in a restaurant, it was closer to two. Loggan, however, was still a busboy. He was 72 now. He had never left, never graduated to serving tables, never became a manager or a chef - he says he never asked to do anything else. So, he had stayed a busboy, for 54 years. The title had evolved since 1964; he was now a "busser." But he still wore the kind of throwback paper hat that a busser wore in 1964. He made whipped butter, and squeezed the oranges for OJ, but mostly, he still bussed plates and glasses, tidied up the same dark wooden booths, passed the same windows inlaid with the same stained-glass foliage, noted the same line of customers snaking out of the front doors, received waves and hugs (and sometimes Bulls tickets) from the same regulars. He had seen generations of customers and co-workers pass through; he'd been there so long he watched Bill Murray go from neighborhood kid to superstar to venerated elder. When he squinted, the same teenagers were still curled into the same booths, the same infants tossed crayons under the same tables, the same captains of industry put away the same post-workout pancake stacks. His 2018 commute wasn't even that different than his 1964 commute. He lives in West Gresham, not far from 89th Street. He takes two trains and a bus in the morning, then back in the afternoon, four days a week. He rides the Red Line almost perfectly from one end to the other. Door to door, that means a roughly two-hour commute, each way. Naturally then, for at least a decade, he's fielded the same questions, all the time. Like, Why? Who busses tables that long? Why not find a job closer to home? Or retire? Eventually people stop asking. Because the more you talk to Othea Loggan, and the more you think about clearing plates of pancakes for half of a century, the more details seem both too obvious and too complicated - there are few satisfying explanations. There is only a man whose choices (amid a systemic lack of choices) offer snapshots, of the changing nature of work, of the lack of opportunities for people of color, of the assumptions we make about ambition. "He could retire now," said Javon Chambers, his grandson, himself a Walker Bros. busser for 15 years. "He's financially straight and everything. I just think he knows when people retire, they die. That's what he's said: Old people don't have nothing to do, they see their friends retire, and then they retire, and that's when they die of boredom too. It's like people who are married a long time - if one dies, the next goes right after. That's like my grandfather and this place. He doesn't want the will inside him to dry up." Other than holding the same foot-in-the-door job an unusual number of years, Loggan has not led an unusual life. Those who've worked alongside him for decades can't tell you much about him. There's no mystery, coworkers say, only a guy who doesn't like to talk about himself; general manager Tom Zehnder said fresh details arrive at a trickle, years apart. Ray Walker, who has owned the Walker Bros. chain in the Chicago area since 1974, calls Loggan a friend and a "great man" - he sang Loggan's praises for an hour - but he has never met Loggan's wife, Claudia, and couldn't tell you much beyond the basics. He's not alone. When I called Loggan by his first name _pronounced "O-tha" - his coworkers often paused to recognize it. They only knew him as "Loggan." Always there, never late, good at his job. The bedrock in a place defined by its permanency. Loggan himself chafes at a lot of this. Of course he does. You would too. He's rankled at the idea anyone could do any job automatically for so long without a complaint or regret. He says: "Back in the day, my son was young, I didn't want to work weekends, I wanted to spend time with him. But I had to work. Now I don't work weekends, and he's older." He lets that settle in. He sits huddled in a booth, silent, then blurts: "Why do you want to ask about my working here? I come to work, who cares?" He says it gravely, and I recall he said the same thing eight years ago, when I first asked him about his job; he looked at me then with a guarded wariness, rolled his eyes and walked away. The next time I asked him, he said OK but he wanted to get paid, Michael Jordan didn't do commercials for free, and only Walker Bros. would see any financial benefit here, so why should he talk? Which is right. Whenever I saw him after that, he softened, or recognized the oddness in his job. But he was never eager to share. If he smiled it was like you won something. (Keeping with Tribune policy, money was never promised or exchanged for his participation in this story.) He has a long face and heavy, unassuming eyes that, at the restaurant, scan the room even as he talks to you - he doesn't like being unaware of what is happening. As he spoke, words came in a fragmented, tumbling rush, as if he needed to say everything now so he could get back to work. He grew up in Greenville, in the Mississippi Delta. It was known for cotton plantations, tugboat manufacturing, and as a pocket of relative tolerance and diversity in the heart of the Jim Crow South; the Stein Mart department store chain was founded there by a family of Russian Jews. It was also known for profound poverty and illiteracy, both ingrained and enforced. "I saw stuff there that made you feel like you had gone back in time," Loggan says. "There was no money." (Indeed, the month he started at Walker Bros., a U.S. District Court in Mississippi upheld the use of literacy tests as a measure of who could vote in the two-thirds African-American community; and as recently as a decade ago, according to literacy surveys, as many as 25 percent of Greenville adults were considered illiterate.) Loggan said he never really knew his father, but his mother, who died in 2000, was the chef in a Greenville soul food restaurant for 40 years. "She would cook breakfast, lunch, then have food ready for staff on their breaks - she was dependable, and she liked her job, and she would tell me that I would have to get along with people - I'm a lot like my mother." But with four brothers and five sisters at home, "she could only help so much, and I stopped my learning early and came to Chicago." He moved with a sister, at the end of the Great Migration that brought millions of black Americans out of the South. While he talks, he works his hands together. He says softly to himself, "Cramps." Asked why, after so many years, he never asked management for a less demanding job, why he stayed at the same pancake house so long, Loggan doesn't register the question, as if those questions hadn't been there in a long time. Ray Walker said he's asked Loggan about advancing but "Loggan doesn't want anything else - he's said he's fine where he is." He said, "I think he views this as a place where he knows people, he's safe and comfortable." He said Loggan "was the complete opposite of a Black Panther kind of guy," never an advocate or rabble rouser. He said that limited schooling "probably helped smooth out his world - I would doubt Loggan really ever dreamed about buying a Cadillac." Loggan himself, asked those questions again and again - Did you ever want to do something else? Did you ever want to advance? - only answers: "It's as simple as this - people treat you well, you don't mind coming to work. Ray is a good man. Maybe I wanted to do something else? I don't remember. This is not an easy place to run. People come in late, don't come in at all, you have to hire - sounds like a headache, man. Who wants to wake up with that responsibility? I'm dependable and they don't worry about me, but I'm not a manager." Jose Antonio Chambers, Loggan's son, a Chicago police officer, told me, "My father is old school - never complains about nothing, never. My mother too. There were times it was hard to get food on the table, and they did not complain." He said his father was great with numbers, that "if he hadn't grown up in the South at that time, if opportunities had been there, he might have done something else. But he got this job, he did it well, held on to it, and there needs to be a lot of respect for someone like that." His father entered the workforce at a time when, if you were dependable and didn't rock the boat, you might assume rightly that you could remain in a job for most of your life. If you were white. Logan will retire - maybe, someday - at a time when transient employment is the norm, when no one assumes an employer will show loyalty to them (and vice versa). Ambition, in a time of low expectations, in a country defined by inequality, can mean holding on to what you have, internalizing your place in the world. "I think Loggan wanted to fit in somewhere," said chef Pat Levy, also known as "Popeye"; he has worked at the restaurant 42 years, arriving in Chicago from Jamaica. "I think Loggan just decided to be a busboy. He is content. It's all he wants. So I ask - isn't that OK?" It's hard not to notice the social gulf between customers and staff in a place like Walker Bros. Not that any of this is unique, of course. The optics are just a bit more evident: The staff is black and Latino, wearing old timey diner hats, serving comfort food to mostly white, affluent, well-educated North Shore families, the dining rooms wrapped in polished wood and stained glass more common a half century ago. That said, it's also not uncommon to see customers giving bear hugs to beloved bussers and servers. It's a warm community hub, a fixture of the local culture. "But the customers help us a lot, tip-wise," said Derrick Rumbult, known as "Breezy," another Jamaican native, who has bussed tables here a mere 38 years. Loggan, after 54 years, along with his fellow bussers, still makes minimum wage. (Management says this averages out to roughly $14 an hour with tips, before taxes.) What he doesn't receive: a pension, health care, a typical 401K plan. Again, none of this is unique to restaurants. It's just a little more pronounced here. Winston Brown, another busser (for the past 38 years), taps his chest and a red light glows through his white coat - "I'm on dialysis," he says. "Medicare only. We make just enough to pay bills - sometimes. When I started here, there was one Walker Bros., this place, and now there are seven of them. And what do we get? We get to pay our rents." Any savings? He laughs sardonically. Loggan doesn't complain. Rumbult, similarly, says management "does a lot, but we could always use help." In a sense, their major benefit is a feeling of job security. With new hires today increasingly less likely to stay at a pancake house long, Ray Walker says his loyalty to his aging bussing staff has only deepened. His father, Victor, who started Walker Bros. with his uncle Everett in 1960 (franchising the business from an Oregon pancake house chain), hired Loggan. He says he probably treats Loggan a little better than the rest of the staff, but hesitated to go into detail: "Others would want to know what they're not getting." For instance, the company took out life insurance on Loggan (payable to his wife); Ray says that for years he's set aside about $50 a month for Loggan, as an informal retirement fund (subject to a 30 percent penalty for early withdrawal). Yet retirement sounds iffy. Bussers and servers at Walker Bros. stay so long, involuntary separation often means they got sick or died. I asked Ray if it was true he brings Loggan his old clothes. He said, yes, occasionally: "A lot of the guys, you see them in the same pants every day, or in clothes in need of repair - many of them don't have a lot of clothes to wear." Well, then why not pay them more? He said they get annual bonuses. He said, "there are a lot of ways to reimburse people." At 5:07 a.m., on the mark, as Loggan promised, a Red Line train pulled into Howard. Cars were sparse, one or two passengers apiece. Loggan ambled out and waited. He wore a Cubs hat, a Cubs T-shirt. A Purple Line train arrived. Loggan took a seat and rubbed at his knees. He'd been awake two hours, likely more. He wasn't feeling good, he said. His aunt, in St. Louis, his mother's sister, she died the day before. She was 98. He couldn't shake it. He called his manager, told him he felt bad, his aunt had died, but he'd be at work. He massaged his hands. His grandson, Javon, who makes the commute with him, curled sideways into a seat, hoodie zipped up and pulled over his head, to catch an extra few minutes of sleep. At the Davis Street station in Evanston, having long ago internalized exactly how much time he had before the 213 bus pulled up, he walked across to 7-11 and bought a sealed package of bologna slices and a single lottery ticket. "Good morning," he said to the clerk. Crossing back to the bus stop, he said "Good morning" to his fellow riders, then quieter, more as a reminder, still thinking about his aunt, he mumbled, "We all got to go that way. And nothing you can do. Better to be with people." The routine is a comfort. Of course, others have stayed in the same job as long or longer. There was a police officer in Milwaukee who stayed on the force 61 years. There was a cashier at a McDonald's in Indiana who stayed a cashier 44 years. And that's just near Chicago. But since the Great Recession, more Americans tell more surveys they can't afford to retire. According to federal labor statistics, the fastest-growing workforce in America are 55-years old and older; not long ago, those people were our slowest-growing workforce. Loggan is just an extreme example. Ana Martenez, 54, a server at Walker Bros. for 16 years, said: "I look at Loggan and I think about those people who tell you they can't get up in the morning. I mean, some of us do it all the time. Life is too expensive. But Loggan will have to stop. Everyone has to stop some time." Loggan said he thinks about this daily. He's not ready. Retirement would mean watching baseball, running errands with his wife, who still works herself, as security at a South Side school. He has a son and a stepdaughter, but they're both adults. He got on the bus. For years, before there was a bus, he would walk to work from the train station, up Green Bay Road at 5 a.m., in the rain and the snow. Many times he would be stopped and questioned by police. In fact it happened so often Bruce Smaha, a former Wilmette officer (and close friend of Ray Walker), began giving Loggan a ride to work in his squad car. Smaha said he did it until he was reported himself (by a concerned citizen) and reprimanded by superiors. These days, the commute is long but smooth; Loggan gets dropped off across the street from the restaurant. The pink neon of the Walker Bros. sign glows faint in the rising sun. "Popeye," Loggan says, passing the chef, who stands on the sidewalk, smoking and thinking before the doors open and service begins. Loggan enters through the side and before taking off his coat, he begins arranging metal pans. Then he churns butter, squeezes oranges. "I need to sleep better," he says without looking up. "But you know, some people you just can't stop thinking about." Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com

Buffalo, N.Y. New York's second-largest city is located in western New York, near the confluence of Lake Erie and the Niagara River, which conspire to produce the lake-effect snow for which Buffalo is well known.

Winter Haven is equidistant to Tampa and Orlando, with a modest citywide $122,064 median house or condo value and $154,291 mean housing price. As these numbers suggest, it is not difficult to find a home here for less than $100,000. Although homes in the lower price range start at less than $35,000, a more typical, $69,000 home, offers three bedrooms, two baths and nearly 1,500 square feet of living space . Pocomoke City, Md. Located along the Pocomoke River at roughly the midpoint between Chincoteague Bay to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west, Pocomoke City calls itself "The Friendliest Town on the Eastern Shore."

This upstate Pennsylvania city lies along the Susquehanna River and offers casino gambling, horse racing and minor league hockey and baseball teams; it is also centrally located to Pocono Mountains attractions such as skiing, hiking and whitewater rafting. Although Wilkes-Barre rates fairly low in most AARP Livability Index measures, it is one of the highest on this list for affordable housing, as illustrated by the 109 under-$100,000 listings found during a recent survey of Zillow listings. A cluster of homes near the city's center is notable for the downtown location and proximity to attractions such as the FM Kirby Center for Performing Arts and the 52-acre Kirby Park, and a home on a city lot listed on Zillow for $49,000 features three bedrooms, one bath and over 1,300 square feet .

AAAOrHc	movies	movienews	Bruce Springsteen plays the soundtrack to life in Blinded by the Light trailer	Blinded By the Light trailer gives Bruce Springsteen's music new life	For a young teen in the new Blinded By the Light trailer, Bruce Springsteen is life. From Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha comes a preview for her film about a British teen of Pakistani descent to the sounds of The Boss. Based on the memoir Greetings from Bury Park by author Sarfraz Manzoor, Blinded By the Light tells of Javed (played by Viveik Kalra), growing up in 1987 in the town of Luton, England. It's a time when Javed wants to be a writer, which isn't something practical in the eyes of his hardworking immigrant family. As racial and economic tensions are also exploding around him, it becomes the time when Springsteen speaks to Javed through song. "Bruce," as Javed's friend says, "is the direct line to all that's true in this s ty world." The concept bears similar notes to Yesterday , Danny Boyle's film about an aspiring songwriter who finds that everyone in the world forgot about The Beatles except for him. Blinded By the Light , which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival, also stars Kulvinder Ghir, Meera Ganatra, Nell Williams, Aaron Phagura, Hayley Atwell, and Dean-Charles Chapman.

AAxqWo3	tv	tvnews	MTV Suspends 'Catfish' in Light of Sexual-Misconduct Claims	The sexual-misconduct allegations involve the show's host and executive producer, Nev Schulman.	(Video provided by Us Weekly) MTV has temporarily halted production of "Catfish: The TV Show" as it investigates allegations of sexual misconduct involving the program's host and executive producer, Nev Schulman, The Daily Beast can reveal. "We take these allegations very seriously," an MTV spokesperson said in a statement. "We're working with Critical Content, our third party production company, to conduct a thorough investigation, and we've put a pause on shooting until the investigation is completed." The show, now in its seventh season, began airing in 2012. In it, Schulman investigates online relationships, attempting to verify whether people are who they say they are on the internet. In a video posted May 12 on YouTube, Ayissha Morgan, who appeared on the show in 2015 , alleges that she was sexually harassed by Schulman throughout the production. A lesbian, Morgan claims Schulman whom she refers to in the video by the pseudonym "Jack" pushed her to "reevaluate" her sexuality and have sex with him. In another video, posted May 14 , Morgan alleges that a female production assistant, "Carol," got her drunk and took advantage of her. The next day, she claims, Schulman invited her into his hotel room, where he allegedly propositioned her. In a statement sent by his publicist, Schulman denied the charges. "The behavior described in this video did not happen and I'm fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth," Schulman said. "I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions but these claims are false." Schulman, 33, is married to Laura Perlongo, with whom he has a 17-month-old child. The couple co-host a web series, "We Need to Talk," for ATTN:. In a statement, ATTN: said it "does not condone harassment of any kind, and we plan to pause working with Nev until this investigation comes to a conclusion."

BBNZaKA	health	wellness	Here's How Many Times You Need to Have Sex to Slow Down Aging	The science-backed reason to get frisky tonight.	Sex isn't just fun and games. Science says there are plenty of incredible health benefits, too. Having sex can relieve stress, improve sleep, lower blood pressure, boost your immunity, and, of course, make you feel more connected to your partner. Now, research suggests the good news doesn't stop there: Having sex at least once a week may also help you live longer. For one week, researchers at the University of California in San Francisco tracked the sex lives of a group of 129 mothers who were in relationships. The participants gave daily reports on their satisfaction with their relationship, as well as how often they were intimate with their partners. The researchers also took blood samples from the women, analyzing cells for indicators of aging. When the researchers compared the women's reports to their blood samples, they found a fascinating pattern. Mothers who had sex with their partners at least once during that week had significantly longer telomeres the protective cap on DNA that determines a cell's lifespan than those who did not. Here are 7 more unexpected health benefits from sex . Telomeres are vital to healthy aging Over time, telomeres break down as a result of things like poor diet, heavy drinking, and the natural process of growing older, according to the study authors. But their results suggest that regular sex can repair and lengthen telomeres, which means cells live longer and help keep you younger. Researchers have linked shorter telomeres to serious health issues like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes; longer telomeres seem to help prevent disease . The study is small, and the findings will need to be confirmed with further research. But there's nothing wrong with applying these findings to your relationship. These are 9 ways not having sex changes your health . Having sex also impacts your relationship happiness Slowing down aging may be a huge perk of having sex once a week, but it may also benefit your relationship: Although there's no magic formula for couples' sexual happiness, a 2017 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior adds to research showing an ideal amount of sex per week exists. The study found that the average adult enjoys sex 54 times a year about once a week based on data from 1989 to 2014.Although that number has declined a bit since the 1990s, another study , published in Social Psychological and Personality Science , confirms that once a week is indeed the magic number of sex sessions couples need for overall happiness. The study surveyed more than 30,000 Americans for 40-plus years and discovered that couples who had sex more than once a week weren't any happier than those who had sex just once a week. According to lead study researcher Amy Muise, the old saying less is more could apply to sex but that doesn't mean you have to follow a strict schedule. "Our findings suggest that it's important to maintain an intimate connection with your partner," she says. "But you don't need to have sex every day as long as you're maintaining that connection." And there you have it: Having sex once a week is the prime number for slowing down aging and boosting your overall happiness. If you're struggling to rekindle your spark in the bedroom, steal these habits of these couples with steamy sex lives . And here are some more science-backed ways to tack years onto your life .

BBV6cLI	finance	finance-retirement	The reason millennials want to retire early should worry the rest of us	Younger people are panicking about the future, says a Hollywood producer who recently filmed a documentary on early retirement.	Retiring early may evoke dreams of whiling away the days on the beach, but that's not the biggest reason it has become so appealing. Instead, early retirement is picking up steam because younger people are experiencing a general panic about the future -- at least, according to the Emmy-nominated Hollywood producer Travis Shakespeare, who recently directed the documentary " Playing with FIRE ." The film follows a 30-something couple navigating the financial independence and early retirement, or FIRE, community and explores the trend through conversations with more than a dozen early retirees. "Because of the internet, and we're constantly bombarded with all these information all day every day, there's a sense of insecurity about the future -- I think greater than we probably have ever had as a society," Shakespeare said in a recent podcast with Brandon of The Mad Fientist , who retired early at age 34. He added that the "social safety nets" of Social Security and healthcare programs were evolving and could be "in jeopardy." He continued: "Also, the financial-services community -- I was about to get conspiratorial -- they have forced the individual into a position of responsibility with their own financial future. And we are woefully unprepared to face that because we don't teach financial literacy to anybody." Instead, he said, American culture has taught society to be consumers under the belief that you make money to spend it. "And that's a lie," Shakespeare said. "So, there's a sense that all of these is just crumbling I think," he said. "And so the idea of being able to have some control and some knowledge and some agency over one's own life I think is very attractive." Related video: Here are signs that you are on track for early retirement (provided by CNBC) This notion isn't far from the various reasons that early retirees have listed to Business Insider about why they retired early - none of which have anything to do with money. "Money has been the primary motivator for my entire adult life, but now that I have enough, I've had to find new sources of motivation," Brandon previously told Business Insider . Grant Sabatier, who retired at age 30 with $1.25 million and is featured in Shakespeare's documentary, has said financial independence has always been about time, not money. In a post published on Business Insider , he said time becomes more valuable as we age because we have less of it left. "If you view money as the goal, then you miss the point," he wrote. "Money is infinite, but time is not." He added: "To me, early retirement simply meant having enough money so that I didn't have to worry about money and could finally follow my passions and find new passions." This exemplifies the desire for control over one's life that Shakespeare spoke of. But will this desire be enough to inspire people to push back against the standard narrative and jump into early retirement? As Shakespeare puts it, "I think that would be radical if we could get 10% of the broad population on board with what we're up to here."

BBVMCOX	autos	autosreview	The 2020 Kia Soul Boxes Out the Competition	With its successful tall-hatch formula, the third-generation Soul still pleases despite not offering AWD and you can skip the optional turbo.	This review has been updated with test results for both the standard 2.0-liter engine and the turbocharged 1.6-liter GT-Line model. If you picture rhythmic, life-size anthropomorphic hamsters, it is (let's hope) because of Kia's catchy marketing effort for the Soul subcompact crossover . We won't judge you if it isn't. Perhaps the Soul is familiar because one recently whisked you away from a bar after being summoned by a ride-hailing app. Or maybe you or someone you know owns one; Kia has sold more than a million of the toaster-shaped things since 2009. Instantly recognizable and increasingly ubiquitous, the Kia Soul is almost iconic. Kia thinks it is iconic, hence why its 2020 redesign is as careful an evolution as, say, the latest Porsche 911's. The Kia is still affordable (prices start at $18,485), and its seating remains tall and chairlike, as in an SUV. The slab-sided, boxy profile and snub nose are unmistakable, and some additional funkiness is provided by taillights that now practically encircle the back window and a scowling face that resembles a Star Wars stormtrooper helmet. Solidly, and Similarly, Packaged The Soul is a two-time Car and Driver 10Best Trucks and SUVs award winner as much for its intelligent price as its clever interior packaging. There remain gobs of head- and legroom front and rear, even though the new model's 1.2-inch-longer wheelbase and additional 2.2 inches of length fail to translate into much more usable space. Rear legroom is actually down 0.3 inch, while front legroom is up just 0.2 inch. Still, the rear seat in particular is spacious and comfortable, with a pleasantly angled seatback. Folding those back seats expands cargo capacity from 24 cubic feet (the same as before) to 62 cubic feet (a little more than before). The doors also open a little wider, and the rear hatch opening is slightly bigger. Like many similarly priced cars, the Soul uses hard plastics throughout its interior, although pricier models have more soft-touch bits. Assembly is impeccable, however, and the overall style feels more aspirational than before. Kia maintains a level of quirkiness inside, upgrading the old model's light-up door speakers which could pulse to the beat of music for available LED-backlit panels mounted higher on the front doors that can put on the same show but are now visible in the daytime. An inductive phone charger is optional. It sits in a useful cubby ahead of the shift lever, above a separate bin where a pair of 12-volt outlets and USB ports live, so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. A 7.0-inch color touchscreen is standard, while a new, 10.3-inch widescreen unit is available. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included on both, and the system's menu structures are easy to navigate. And Kia finally has added some active-safety features to the Soul's option sheet. Still Defiantly Un-Crossover-Like The Soul still isn't available with all-wheel drive, but we don't view that as a reason to revoke its subcompact-crossover card, even if nearly every competitor does offer the option. (We have, after all, named it our 10Best pick in that segment before.) Most customers in this class are looking for a commanding driving position, not Jeep-like abilities for clambering over rocks. We drove the Soul in light snow, and it survived; you'll do just fine. Besides, the Kia has a decidedly un-car-like 6.7 inches of ground clearance, up from 5.9 inches last year. Kia's only other concession that the Soul perhaps isn't SUV-ish enough for some is a new X-Line trim. Functionally no different from the base LX, S, or EX trims (so you can consider its test numbers, included below, as applicable to essentially the entire lineup), the X-Line gets tougher-looking bumpers and plastic fender flares. We've also driven the new GT-Line trim that sits opposite the X-Line and essentially replaces last year's Turbo model, wearing a more street-friendly look with a center-exit exhaust, monochromatic bodywork, and a sportier suspension tune. Every Soul, even the GT-Line, comes standard with an Atkinson-cycle 2.0-liter inline-four, which replaces both last year's weak entry-level 1.6-liter and mid-level 2.0-liter engines . Its 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque land pretty much between the outputs of those two previous engines, while its smoothness and refinement are far better than both. In most Souls, the 2.0-liter pairs with a new continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), which supplants last year's six-speed automatic in all but the base model, which uses a six-speed manual and can be optioned with the CVT. This, surprisingly, is a very good development. Like many new-age CVTs, Kia's boasts a direct feel and will fake fixed-gear ratios to prevent the engine from revving too far out of sync with the car's acceleration, as less adroit CVTs do. Use less than half throttle and you'll barely notice it working, the transmission smoothly changing ratios as the car builds speed perfect for this sort of car and the buyers who'll gravitate to it. The new transmission also helps the 2.0-liter engine motivate the Soul to 60 mph 0.1 second quicker (in 8.0 seconds flat) than the previous-generation Soul equipped with the more powerful, 164-hp version of the same engine and a six-speed automatic. The freshened powertrain also is 1 decibel quieter with the gas pedal pressed to the floor. Fuel-economy ratings for the new Soul with the 2.0-liter-and-CVT combo are up by a few mpg across the board. However, on our highway-fuel-economy test run at 75 mph, the new car achieved 30 mpg, which is 3 mpg worse than its EPA highway figure and no better than what we got from a previous Soul Turbo . That 201-hp turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission live on as an option in the GT-Line cars. The setup suffers the same oddly timed gearchanges, abrupt low-speed response, and surging power delivery as it did in the previous-generation Soul Turbo. There are steering wheel-mounted shift paddles for manual gear selection, but the additional control doesn't do much to aid the transmission's refinement. Though entertainingly quicker than the base engine zero to 60 mph is a 6.4-second affair the GT-Line Turbo is no fleeter than its predecessor, the Soul Turbo. While one 2017 Soul Turbo we tested was (barely) slower to 60 mph, our long-term 2017 Soul Turbo test car posted a hotter 6.3-second run when new and shaved 0.1 second from that performance when its odometer rolled past 40,000 miles. A manual transmission could spice up the GT-Line's turbo engine, but Kia doesn't offer one. Too bad. Solidly Capable Straight-line speed aside, there is little difference in athleticism among the new Soul's trim levels. The GT-Line rides slightly firmer, yet every Soul we drove exhibited good body control, improved ride quality, and better isolation from wind and road noise. So composed and planted is the Soul, in fact, that the X-Line clung to our skidpad to the tune of 0.91 g on all-season tires no less (Hankook Ventus S1 Noble2, sized 235/45R-18). That lateral grip figure places the humble Soul on the grippier side of the Honda Civic Si (on its standard all-season tires) and the last Volkswagen GTI we tested. Weirdly, the X-Line was stickier around our skidpad than the GT-Line Turbo, which posted a decent but lesser 0.85-g grip figure. We suspect the Turbo's humdrum Goodyear Eagle Touring tires, which were the same size as the X-Line's Hankooks, are to blame. Less grip could also explain the GT-Line's 11-foot-longer stopping distance from 70 mph (172 feet). The X-Line's impressive road adhesion aside, every 2020 Soul is best described as a point-and-shoot kind of car, one that's competent, if not exactly fun to drive. The numb and strongly boosted steering is disappointing, particularly in the range-topping turbocharged GT-Line model, which, at $28,485 to start ($28,710 as tested), is priced awfully close to the VW GTI despite being not nearly as cohesively sporty or upscale in feel. The lower-priced versions are a better value, and you won't be disappointed by a jerky transmission and the unfulfilled promise of performance. As stylish as ever, Kia's latest box is attractive and practical and should please, whether you need affordable wheels, an off-road-wannabe hatchback like the X-Line, or end up being chauffeured in the back seat after a night out partying like an anthropomorphic hamster.

Generally speaking, the lower ride height of the typical minivan means it can be more nimble and easier to maneuver than a larger, heavier SUV. Comfort levels are also a strong suit for minivans from the likes of Honda, Toyota, Chrysler, and Dodge. Depending on how many options you add, occupants in all three rows of seating can be indulged with entertainment systems, panoramic sunroofs, climate controls, plenty of USB outlets and, as is the norm with minivans, a cup holder pretty much everywhere you look. Minivans tend to have more cargo and seating space than SUVs of similar length, because they don't have a big truck chassis taking up valuable real estate under the floor. That often means they weigh considerably less than an SUV of similar size, and they get better fuel economy. Due to their family-focused design, they also generally score strong marks in crash testing. But you probably already know how great minivans are, because you're here! So, which minivan is the right one for you? On the following slides, we use an automated feed to provide you with every manufacturer-sponsored deal we can find on every minivan on the market. Deals are updated each month and may not be available all the time, or in every part of the country. These deals are usually limited to people with excellent credit. Click through the following pages to see the best minivan lease deals and purchase deals available this month. 2019 Honda Odyssey Lease Deal: As low as $329 per month for 36 months with $2,499 due at signing Purchase Deal: 1.9% financing for up to 36 months or 2.9% financing for up to 60 months The Honda Odyssey is a great minivan and the perfect driving tool for anyone who needs to haul lots of people and cargo. While the Odyssey is meant as a value proposition, that doesn t mean you can t turn this minivan into a luxury ride. Available features include the HondaVac built-in vacuum cleaner, leather seating, heated and ventilated front seats, Apple CarPlay , Android Auto , a hands-free power liftgate, a Wi-Fi hot spot, wireless phone charging, and an 11-speaker stereo, to name a few. The Odyssey also features a wide range of safety features, which help cement this Honda s status as a great choice for families. Powering the Odyssey is a smooth 280-horsepower V6. Mileage is impressive at 19 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. If you thought minivans weren t quick off the line, think again, because this Honda has plenty of power to get you down the road in a hurry.

That s right. If you want the space and utility of a minivan, along with added grip for when the weather turns nasty, the Sienna is your only choice. This all-weather Toyota comes powered by a potent 296-horsepower engine. In front-wheel drive format, it s also reasonably good in terms of fuel economy, returning 19 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. Adding all-wheel drive drops these figures to 18 mpg city/24 mpg highway. Cargo room is something that also sets the Sienna apart from other family haulers. Behind the third-row seats, there is 39.1 cubic feet of cargo room. That s a huge amount of space, even before you start folding seats down. With the second- and third-row seats folded, there is about 150 cubic feet of room   or about the equivalent of a studio apartment in Manhattan. The Sienna has a very quiet and soft ride, though it sometimes leans further into corners than sportier rivals (we re looking at you, Honda Odyssey ). Safety equipment is here in abundance. The Sienna comes standard with forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams.

Step inside a well-optioned Pacifica and you ll be amazed at the quality of the cabin, not to mention the vast range of comfort features that can be added to it. This is definitely not the wood-paneled minivan you might remember from your childhood. Powering the Pacifica is a 287-horsepower V6. This front-wheel-drive powertrain returns a respectable 28 mpg during highway driving. Nimble handling and a controlled ride mean this Pacifica doesn t turn into a quivering bowl of Jello when the road gets twisty, or if you need to mix it up with heavy city traffic. We don't yet have Chrysler deals in our database, but we've included a snapshot of the deals available above. Keep in mind that deals vary by region. Research the Chrysler Pacifica on MSN Autos | Find a Chrysler Pacifica near you 2019 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Cash Back Deal: Up to $3,500 cash back Lease Deal: As low as $434 per month for 36 months The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is a great way to transport the whole family in calm and quiet comfort. In fact, when you put this hybrid-powered minivan into electric mode, you ll have about 33 miles of near-silence, as the Pacifica operates on pure electric power. Once the gas-fed engine kicks in, this Chrysler minivan has the driving range of any normal vehicle. There is seating for seven onboard, though the rearmost seats can be cramped for tall adults. Behind the third row is 32.3 cubic feet of cargo space. The cabin is notable for its user-friendly design and high-quality materials. This is definitely not a minivan that s been built simply to offer wipe-clean surfaces and hard plastics that can take a beating. The base Pacifica Hybrid Touring Plus trim includes features like tri-zone automatic climate control, an 8.4-inch touch-screen infotainment system, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay, along with a rearview camera and blind spot monitoring. We don't yet have Chrysler deals in our database, but we've included a snapshot of the deals available above. Keep in mind that deals vary by region. 2020 Chrysler Pacifica Finance Deal: As low as 0% financing for 60 months plus up to $2,000 cash back Cash Back Deal: Up to $2,000 cash back Lease Deal: As low as $392 per month for 36 months The Pacifica heads into 2020 with few changes, so you won't lose much by going with the cheaper 2019 model. Research the Chrysler Pacifica on MSN Autos | Find a Chrysler Pacifica near you 2020 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Finance Deal: As low as 3.75% financing for 60 months Lease Deal: As low as $466 per month for 36 months The Pacifica Hybrid heads into 2020 with few changes, so you won't lose much by going with the cheaper 2019 model. 2019 Kia Sedona Lease Deal: As low as $319 per month for 36 months OR $334 for 24 Finance Deal: 0% financing for 75 months Cash Back Deal: Up to $4,000 cash back The 2019 Kia Sedona sometimes gets lost behind the segment juggernauts from Chrysler, Honda, and Toyota, but that's not because it's a bad vehicle. Though competitors are roomier and have more power and features, the Sedona stands out with its intuitive UVO touch-screen infotainment system, comfortable seats, and extra-long warranty. Like the Grand Caravan, the Sedona has a lower-than-average price, making it a great bargain when paired with the deals being offered here. Research the Kia Sedona on MSN Autos | Find a Kia Sedona near you 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan Cash Back Deal: Up to $2,250 cash back Finance Deal: 0% financing for 36 months plus up to $500 bonus cash The Dodge Grand Caravan rolls into another model year relatively unchanged. While this minivan lacks some of the refinement and safety features found in more modern rivals, there s no doubt the Grand Caravan represents a lot of value. With a starting price of about $26,700, this Dodge is thousands of dollars less than many of its competitors. Inside, you ll find the extremely functional Stow  n Go seating, which allows the second- and third-row seats to be folded flat into the floor. The Grand Caravan also comes standard with a strong 283-horsepower V6. This powertrain returns 17 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway.

BBV4fIV	lifestyle	lifestylefamilyandrelationships	This Advice Could Help Save a Marriage	Before you call it quits, consider putting these relationship tips to the test.	If your spouse has gone from being your best friend to feeling like a total stranger, you may wonder if your marriage is on the outs. But getting a divorce is a huge decision, especially if there's a chance you can rebuild what's been lost. We asked the experts for their advice on how to save a marriage , so you can stop googling " signs you're in a loveless relationship ," and start trying to salvage what's left if that's indeed what you're looking for. Here's what we learned: Recognize what's working. Chances are, your relationship isn't all bad, all the time―but it can be hard to single out the good things when there's so much discord. "All marriages have low points," says Ellen Chute, LMSW. "What brings people out of the low points is their ability to be open to the positives." One way to do this is by changing your inner dialogue when you're unhappy with your partner. For example, instead of thinking I'm so irritated that they're never home for dinner try saying, I'm grateful they have the weekends free to spend time with the family. Reframing your mindset to be more positive, allows for more acceptance and may help rebuild the friendship and trust that feels gone. Remember the good. When you first met, did you love exploring new places together? Did you make each other laugh? When a marriage is failing, it's important for both partners to try to recognize and remember the things that once attracted you to each other, says Dr. Erica MacGregor , a clinical psychologist who specializes in couples therapy. According to MacGregor, if couples can remember why they fell in love in the first place, then there is "a glimmer of hope." Use those feelings and memories as the foundation to rebuild what's broken. Accept the past. Maybe one of you had an affair. Or perhaps you discovered something about your partner that shook you to the core. Whatever it is, if you've both decided to move forward together, it's important to embrace what happened and commit to a new beginning, says MacGregor. She explains, "In some cases, this means grieving the loss of what you once idealized in your relationship and realizing that it has changed into something different." Nancy Dreyfus, author of Talk To Me Like I'm Someone You Love , agrees, "You don't want a patch-up job," she says. Instead, "recreate something fresh, with more transparency than before." Be open-minded. It can be difficult to see your partner's point of view, especially when you disagree. But in order to bring a marriage back from the brink,"couples need to be able to listen to something that sounds totally absurd, and still see how it looks to their partner," explains Dreyfus. For example, this may mean saying things like, It's hard to admit, but I can see why you may fantasize about other people. While it may feel uncomfortable, "you are not betraying yourself," says Dreyfus. Instead, what you are doing is validating your partner's truth, bringing you one step closer to rebuilding your partnership. Find time for self-care. Do you count on your partner to be your everything? If so, that can hit a marriage hard. "We cannot expect our partner to fulfill all our needs," says Kelley Kitley LCSW psychotherapist and author . In order to have a healthy marriage, "we have the responsibility to live dynamic lives including socializing, friendships, and activities that ensure we are living our best life," she explains. When you are happy with yourself, it's easier to be happy in the relationship. "We are all a work in progress," says Kitley. Put the relationship first. "Both individuals in the marriage need to make improving the relationship a priority," Kitley says. But to do this, each person needs to be self-aware and reflective of their role. Kitley recommends asking yourself, "Am I putting effort into this relationship or are we just living parallel lives?" She says some marriages just need a "tune up," and recommends date nights or going away on an uninterrupted weekend together to help regain lost intimacy. Acknowledge what you can't fix. Relationship expert and best-selling author John Gottman believes every couple has their own set of conflicts that will never be resolved. "These conflicts come up again and again in a relationship," explains MacGregor. Instead of trying to win the argument each time these unsolvable issues arise, MacGregor says that couples should come to an understanding regarding the deeper meaning of each other's position. "That understanding creates intimacy and connection," she says. Don't give up too soon. "Understandably, there may be some ambivalence," says MacGregor, "but there has to be a commitment to try to work through the difficult issues." This can take months or even years each couple and situation is different. The truth is, everyone has their bad habits, annoyances, and unique problems. "If each partner realizes that they will have conflicts no matter who they are married to, this bodes well for the success of the marriage," she says. Ask for help. You can follow all the advice, and read all the books , but sometimes the most effective option is to see a licensed professional who can work with you and your spouse to address specific issues. "A marriage therapist can act as coach, mediator and a teacher," says Kitley. A good marriage therapist should stay as neutral as possible while supporting and challenging both parties, she explains. To find a therapist you both are comfortable with, Kitley suggests asking friends for recommendations. Or, start your search on GoodTherapy , ZocDoc , or Psychology Today . Alternatively, if you're a member of a religious organization, you can ask if they have trained clergy to counsel. Related video: Do you love me?

BBKyR1L	autos	autostrucks	First Drive: 2019 Ram 1500	Better in Every Way	The good folks at Ram have been moving at a seemingly superhuman pace this year. In mid-January 2018, we were introduced for the first time to the company's all-new '19 Ram 1500. The covers came off at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and the pickup hidden beneath stunned the world. Fast-forward less than two months, and you'll arrive at point when we in the automotive-media world were given our first chance to drive Ram's new truck. Why is that important? If you've been reading these types of publications for any period of time, you'll surely recognize just how insanely quick the cadence has been. And to further blow your mind, by the time you're holding this in your hands, Ram's new pride and joy will be on dealer lots waiting for a forever home. A Brief Recap The truck is all-new from top to bottom, front to back. The chassis is constructed of high-strength steel and has been redone to increase rigidity. Shedding weight was part of the plan as well, but Ram cut just over 200 pounds out of the new 1500 in strategic ways while retaining a steel body. Suspension remains the rear five-link coil design that the company pioneered in '09, but has been improved to meet customers' evolving needs. Powertrains remain familiar, with the 3.6L Pentastar V-6 and 5.7L Hemi returning, now with an eTorque 48-volt mild-hybrid system standard on the V-6 and optional on V-8. Even the two eight-speed transmissions have been reworked, along with the transfer case on four-wheel-drive models. The '19 Ram 1500 is offered in two cabs, Quad or Crew, with two bed choices: 5-foot, 7-inch or 6-foot, 4-inch a regular cab and an 8-foot bed are likely, but not yet confirmed. Six trim levels are available to suit any taste, from the base model Tradesman up to the top-spec Limited. Inside the Limited, one will find a near (or exceeding) luxury-car level of comfort, features, and refinement, all of which is anchored by a new 12-inch uConnect system. Simply thinking about a Tradesman will cost $31,695, while checking all of the boxes on a Limited pushes that number north of $60K. Behind the Wheel Enough about what we already know, let's get to the real reason we're all here: to find out just how good Ram's new ½-ton is in the real world. First, let's clear the elephants out of the room. For our first taste, Ram provided a fleet of pickups in different trim levels and cab configurations, but they were all outfitted with the standard 5.7L Hemi V-8 engine. Both eTorque-equipped engines as well as well as the 3.0L EcoDiesel V-6 are late-availability, and Ram has promised that we'll get to review those variants soon. At any rate, Ram has already divulged that it expects the standard 5.7L Hemi V-8 to be the volume leader, so it makes perfect sense to launch with this engine. Our time with the truck spanned more than 500 miles, which included plenty of open highway, urban traffic, and rugged off-road driving. We planted ourselves behind the controls of Limited, Laramie, and Rebel models, while also sampling the remaining trims (Big Horn, Longhorn, and Tradesman.) The first thing we noticed about this new pickup was just how incredibly smooth the ride quality is. Ram updated the front and rear suspension and added snazzy new Frequency Response Damping (FRD) shock absorbers to all models, with the exception of Rebel. The ride over rough pavement is impressively isolated with either the steel spring or optional air-spring suspension. Even more amazing than the ride quality is the fact that Ram was able to produce an almost car-like highway ride without sacrificing capability. When properly equipped, the '19 Ram 1500 can haul up to 2,300 pounds of payload or tow a 12,750-pound trailer. Equally impressive is the quietness of the cabin. Through such technologies as active noise cancelation and laminated acoustic glass, Ram claims an interior decibel level of just 67.1, making it the quietest Ram ever. We're admittedly a touch spoiled with just how quiet pickups have become, but we were impressed nonetheless. Adding to the cabin's quietness are what Ram calls Active Tuned Mass Modules (ATMM). Mounted to the framerails on Hemi-equipped Rams, these "shakers" create vibrations that cancel out those produced by the engine. The result is less noticeable NVH for occupants and the ability to utilize cylinder deactivation more frequently. Fuel-economy ratings for the '19 model remain the same as the outgoing '18 at 15 city/22 highway/17 combined mpg. Four-wheel-drive models drop to 21 mpg on the highway, but remain at 15 city and 17 combined. Interestingly, the EPA rating is achieved using mid-grade gasoline. We fought an incredibly strong headwind during our drive, so getting accurate economy numbers was impossible. However, from what we did observe, we're confident that achieving the EPA rating won't be an issue. Admittedly, we expected better from the EPA given the work Ram did to improve aerodynamics of the new 1500, but we still have the eTorque-equipped powertrains to look forward to. Steering is powered by a new electric-assist unit and is fantastic in most situations. Directional stability on the highway is excellent, but we felt the unit was a bit overboosted at slower speeds, giving an incredibly light feel to the steering. We'd love to see a sport mode that tightens up the steering a touch, as well as improving transmission shift speed. Speaking of the transmission, we still enjoy the eight-speed automatic and 5.7L Hemi V-8 combination. In typical Hemi fashion, power is delivered high in the rpm range and shifts are smooth and refined. Downshifts can be a bit sluggish under hard acceleration such as passing, but that's easily overcome by applying more skinny pedal. Slowing all the power are new larger brakes, which we found to have a very linear and confidence-inspiring feel, not over-the-top grabby, and with no sign of sponge. High Tech and High Class Performance is one thing, but in this day and age, buyers demand more from their pickups. For this reason, Ram set to improving the interior experience as well. Seats are comfortable across the lineup, from the vinyl in Tradesman to cloth in Bighorn and leather in Laramie and above, Ram claims that Limited has more leather, real wood, and metal trim than any of its competitors, and we have no reason to doubt the stat. A 5.0-inch uConnect system is standard on lower trims, 8.4-inch is optional on most, and the new and impressive 12-inch uConnect comes standard on Limited. We've been big fans of the uConnect system for years, and the latest updates do nothing but improve upon the already great system. And, as you can imagine, the 12-inch screen is nothing short of a work of art. With its addition to the lineup, Ram has taken a big step toward future-proofing the '19 1500. Adding to the list of already impressive available features are a new panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera system, semi-automatic parallel and perpendicular parking systems, blind-spot monitoring, and lane-keep assist. Adaptive cruise control with the ability to bring the truck to a full stop and then resume when traffic moves is one of our staff favorites. Audiophiles will be excited to hear that Ram's new truck is available with a 19-speaker, 900-watt Harmon Kardon sound system, the most powerful factory sound system in a pickup, and it sounds amazing. The rear seat is beyond comfortable, with 4 inches of additional legroom over the outgoing truck and a truly flat floor. Seats recline up to 8 degrees and are available with both heating and ventilation, also a first for the pickup segment. The rear seat of the Crew Cab is huge, and the Quad Cab is incredibly comfortable. Long Live Rebel We were excited to hear that Rebel would be returning for '19, and even more excited when we heard that it was getting a handful of impressive updates that would make it more capable than the first-generation. The rear suspension has been optimized for off-road performance, new Bilstein monotube shocks are at all four corners with remote reservoirs on the rear, the tires are now more aggressive Goodyear Duratrac units in a larger 33-inch size, and a locking rear differential has been added to the package. The sadistic minds at Ram set up a brutal off-road course that included deep ruts, rocks, sand, silt, hill climbs, whoops, and lots of opportunity for tearing body panels off. We jumped in, dropped the transfer case into 4-High, and proceeded to push the Rebel harder than we ever thought possible. Impressively, the plucky off-roader took everything we threw at it so we pushed it harder. By the end of our three laps, we were nothing short of impressed. Traction is amazing and the Bilstein dampers soaked up the bumps with ease. With smart driving, this truck will go anywhere you point it. Complaints were few and far between. Steering is a little on the light side; we'd like it firmed up a touch for better feedback. Also, a bit of operator error, but when forgetting to disengage traction control, the truck brought itself to a complete halt the first time the tires hit sand, which is exactly the opposite of what you want. Our staff is also still split on the more youthful interior of the Rebel, but more like it than not. We drove a pair of air-spring equipped Crew Cab Rebels on the off-road course. We're excited for the opportunity to get behind the controls of a steel-spring Rebel in the future, as we feel this setup will be the best combination. We'll report back in due time. Final Thoughts It may be cliché, but Ram has truly pulled out all of the stops on the new '19 1500. The team has improved the vehicle in every way. Ride comfort is outstanding, interior appointments rival the traditional luxury stalwarts, and the available technology will ensure the pickup stays relevant well into the next decade. Best of all, these improvements have come with no sacrifice to performance or capability. Towing is improved, payload has increased, and fuel economy will undoubtedly jump when the eTorque-equipped engines are introduced. If we were Ram's competition, we'd be more than a little worried about what this means for our market share, and we're even more excited to see what the competition does in response. We're seeing the glory days of the pickup market, and we love what we see. 2019 Ram 1500 (Limited, Crew Cab, 4x4) Vehicle type: Fullsize, ½-ton pickup Base price: $57,390 Price as tested: $60,000 (est.)

Detroit, Michigan As much as we enthusiasts love the rough-and-tumble Wrangler and super-powerful Trackhawk , there's no denying the importance of the Cherokee to the Jeep brand. A compact crossover that competes in the huge, competitive class dominated by names like RAV4 and CR-V , it's an important vehicle for consumers. The 2019 Jeep Cherokee has been redesigned to try to fix what ailed the outgoing model, which was first introduced back in 2013. To whit, it wore an unconventional and not at all Jeep-like face, it was on the portly side, and its cargo room stats weren't up to par. So Jeep engineers and designers worked to fix all that in a bid to make the Cherokee even more of a hit with customers. The new crossover looks more like other Jeeps, it's got more room in its cargo area, and it went on a diet. This Cherokee also is equipped with a new turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, which delivers more torque than the optional V6. And it's loaded to the hilt with convenience and safety features, like a panoramic sunroof, cooled front seats, lane-keep assist, and even self-parking. With all those changes and features, is the 2019 Jeep Cherokee at the top of the compact crossover heap? Find out in the latest episode of Why Buy?

BBV4YU5	finance	finance-retirement	10 best retirement plans in 2020	Not all retirement plans are equal. Find out the ones that work best for you.	If you have young kids or you're still building your career, retirement may not be top of mind at this point in your life. But someday, if you're lucky and save on a regular basis, it will be. To help ensure you have a financially secure retirement, it's wise to create a plan early in life -- or right now if you haven't already done so. By diverting a portion of your paycheck into a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan, for example, your wealth can grow exponentially to help you achieve peace of mind for those so-called golden years. Retirement benefits are so important that they should be a top consideration when you're shopping for a new job. Yet only about half of current employees understand the benefits offered to them, according to a January 2019 survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "Plan design is individualized, so one company's benefit formula may not be as generous as others," explains David Littell, professor of taxation and retirement planning expert at The American College of Financial Services. "It's really important that you read the summary plan description that is provided to all participants so that you can understand the design of the plan." Key plan benefits to consider Virtually all retirement plans offer a tax advantage, whether it's available upfront during the savings phase or when you're taking withdrawals. For example, 401(k) contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which reduces your taxable income. Roth IRAs, in contrast, are funded with after-tax dollars but withdrawals are tax-free. Some retirement savings plans also include matching contributions from your employer, such as 401(k) plans, while others don't. When trying to decide whether to invest in a 401(k) at work or an individual retirement account (IRA), go with the 401(k) if you get a company match - or do both if you can afford it. If you were automatically enrolled in your company's 401(k) plan, check to make sure you're taking full advantage of the company match if one is available. And consider increasing your annual contribution, since many plans start you off at a paltry deferral level that is not enough to ensure retirement security. Roughly half of 401(k) plans that offer automatic enrollment, according to Vanguard, use a default savings deferral rate of just 3 percent. Yet T. Rowe Price says you should "aim to save at least 15 percent of your income each year." If you're self-employed, you also have several retirement savings options to choose from. In addition to the plans described below for rank-and-file workers as well as entrepreneurs, you can also invest in a Roth IRA or traditional IRA , subject to certain income limits, which have smaller annual contribution limits than most other plans. The best retirement plans to consider in 2020: 1. Defined contribution plans Since their introduction in the early 1980s, defined contribution (DC) plans, which include 401(k)s, have all but taken over the retirement marketplace. Roughly 84 percent of Fortune 500 companies offer DC plans rather than traditional pensions. The 401(k) plan is the most ubiquitous DC plan among employers of all sizes, while the similarly structured 403(b) plan is offered to employees of public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations, and the 457(b) plan is most commonly available to state and local governments. The contribution limit for each plan is $19,500 in 2020 ($26,000 for those age 50 and over). Many DC plans offer a Roth version, in which you use after-tax dollars to contribute, but you can take the money out tax-free at retirement. "The Roth election makes sense if you expect your tax rate to be higher at retirement than it is at the time you're making the contribution," says Littell. 401(k) plans A 401(k) plan is a tax-advantaged plan that offers a way to save for retirement. An employee contributes to the plan with pre-tax wages, meaning contributions are not considered taxable income. The 401(k) plan allows these contributions to grow tax-free until they're withdrawn at retirement. At retirement, distributions create a taxable gain, though withdrawals before age 59 1/2 may be subject to taxes and additional penalties. Pros: A 401(k) plan can be an easy way to save for retirement, because you can schedule the money to come out of your paycheck and be invested automatically. The money can be invested in a number of high-return investments such as stocks, and you won't have to pay tax on the gains until you withdraw the funds. In addition, many employers offer you a match on contributions, giving you free money - and an automatic gain - just for saving. Cons: One key disadvantage of 401(k) plans is that you may have to pay a penalty for accessing the money if you need it for an emergency. While many plans do allow you to take loans from your funds for qualified reasons, it's not a guarantee that your employer's fund will do that. Your investments are limited to the funds provided in your employer's 401(k) program, so you may not be able to invest in what you want to. What it means to you: A 401(k) plan is one of the best ways to save for retirement, and if you can get bonus "match" money from your employer, you can save even more quickly. 403(b) plans A 403(b) plan is much the same as a 401(k) plan, but it's offered by public schools, charities and some churches, among others. The employee contributes pre-tax money to the plan, so contributions are not considered taxable income, and these funds can grow tax-free until retirement. At retirement, withdrawals create a taxable gain, and distributions before age 59 1/2 may create additional taxes and penalties. Pros: A 403(b) is an effective and popular way to save for retirement, and you can schedule the money to be automatically deducted from your paycheck, helping you to save more effectively. The money can be invested in a number of investments, including annuities or high-return assets such as stock funds, and you won't have to pay taxes until you withdraw the money. Some employers may also offer you a matching contribution if you save money in a 403(b). Cons: Like the 401(k), the money in a 403(b) plan can be difficult to access unless you have a qualified emergency. While you may still be able to access the money without an emergency, it may cost you additional penalties and taxes, though you can also take a loan from your 403(b). Another downside: you may not be able to invest in what you want, since your options are limited to the plan's investment choices. What it means to you: A 403(b) plan is one of the best ways for workers in certain sectors to save for retirement, especially if they can receive any matching funds. 457(b) plans A 457(b) plan is similar to a 401(k), but it's available only for employees of state and local governments and some tax-exempt organizations. In this tax-advantaged plan, an employee can contribute to the plan with pre-tax wages, which means the income is not taxed. The 457(b) allows contributions to grow tax-free until retirement, and when the employee withdraws money, it becomes taxable. Pros: A 457(b) plan can be an effective way to save for retirement, because of its tax advantages. The plan offers some special catch-up savings provisions for older workers that other plans don't offer, as well. The 457(b) is considered a supplemental savings plan, and so withdrawals before age 59 1/2 are not subject to the 10 percent penalty that 401(k) plans are. Cons: The typical 457(b) plan does not offer an employer match, which makes it much less attractive than a 401(k) plan. Also, it's even tougher to take an emergency withdrawal from a 457(b) plan than from a 401(k). What it means to you: A 457(b) plan can be a good retirement plan, but it does offer some drawbacks, compared to other defined contributions plans. And by offering withdrawals before the typical retirement age of 59 1/2 without an additional penalty, the 457(b) can be beneficial for retired public servants who may have a physical disability and need access to their money. 2. IRA plans An IRA is a valuable retirement plan created by the U.S. government to help workers save for retirement. Individuals can contribute up to $6,000 to an account in 2020, and workers over age 50 can contribute up to $7,000. There are many kinds of IRAs, including a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, spousal IRA, rollover IRA, SEP IRA and SIMPLE IRA. Here's what each is and how they differ from one another. Traditional IRA A traditional IRA is a tax-advantaged plan that allows you significant tax breaks while you save for retirement. Anyone who earns money by working can contribute to the plan with pre-tax dollars, meaning any contributions are not taxable income. The IRA allows these contributions to grow tax-free until the account holder withdraws them at retirement and they become taxable. Earlier withdrawals may leave the employee subject to additional taxes and penalties. Pros: A traditional IRA is a very popular account to invest for retirement, because it offers some valuable tax benefits, and it also allows you to purchase an almost-limitless number of investments - stocks, bonds, CDs, real estate and still other things. Perhaps the biggest benefit, though, is that you won't owe any tax until you withdraw the money at retirement. Cons: If you need your money from a traditional IRA, it can be costly to remove it, because of taxes and additional penalties. And an IRA requires you to invest the money yourself, whether that's in a bank or in stocks or bonds or something else entirely. You'll have to decide where and how you'll invest the money, even if that's only to ask an adviser to invest it. What it means to you: A traditional IRA is one of the best retirement plans around, though if you can get a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, that's somewhat better. But if your employer doesn't offer a defined contribution plan, then a traditional IRA is available to you instead -- though the tax deductibility of contributions is eliminated at higher income levels. Roth IRA A Roth IRA is a newer take on a traditional IRA, and it offers substantial tax benefits. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax money, meaning you've paid taxes on money that goes into the account. In exchange, you won't have to pay tax on any contributions and earnings that come out of the account at retirement. Pros: The Roth IRA offers several advantages, including the special ability to avoid taxes on all money taken out of the account in retirement, at age 59 1/2 or later. The Roth IRA also provides lots of flexibility, because you can often take out contributions - not earnings - at any time without taxes or penalties. This flexibility actually makes the Roth IRA a great retirement plan option. Cons: As with a traditional IRA, you'll have full control over the investments made in a Roth IRA. And that means you'll need to decide how to invest the money or have someone do that job for you. There are income limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, though there's a back-door way to get money into one. What it means to you: A Roth IRA is an excellent choice for its huge tax advantages, and it's an excellent choice if you're able to grow your earnings for retirement and keep the taxman from touching it again. Spousal IRA IRAs are normally reserved for workers who have earned income, but the spousal IRA allows the spouse of a worker with earned income to fund an IRA as well. The working spouse's taxable income must be more than the contributions made to any IRAs. Your spousal IRA can either be a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Pros: The biggest positive of the spousal IRA is that it allows a non-working spouse to take advantage of an IRA's various benefits, either the traditional or Roth version. Cons: There's not a particular downside to a spousal IRA, though like all IRAs, you'll have to decide how to invest the money. What it means to you: The spousal IRA allows you to take care of your spouse's retirement planning without forcing your partner to have earned income as would usually be the case. That may allow your spouse to stay home or take care of other family needs. Rollover IRA A rollover IRA is created when you move a retirement account such as a 401(k) or IRA to a new IRA account. You "roll" the money from one account to the rollover IRA, and can still take advantage of the tax benefits of an IRA. You can establish a rollover IRA at any institution that allows you to do so, and the rollover IRA can be either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. There's no limit to the amount of money that can be transferred into a rollover IRA. A rollover IRA also allows you to change the type of retirement account, from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, or vice versa. You'll create a rollover IRA account to move the money into and then make the transfer. Certain types of transfers can create tax liabilities, however, so it's important to understand these consequences before you decide how to proceed. Pros: A rollover IRA allows you to continue to take advantage of attractive tax benefits, if you decide to leave a former employer's 401(k) plan for whatever reason. If you simply want to change IRA providers for an existing IRA, you can roll over your account to a new provider. As in all IRAs, you can buy a wide variety of investments. Cons: Like all IRAs, you'll need to decide how to invest the money, and that may cause problems for some people. You should pay special attention to any tax consequences for rolling over your money, because they can be substantial, but this is generally only an issue if you're changing your account type. What it means to you: A rollover IRA is a convenient way to move from a 401(k) or an IRA to another IRA account. The rollover IRA may be able to improve your financial situation by offering you a chance to change IRA types from traditional to Roth or vice versa. SEP IRA The SEP IRA is set up like a traditional IRA, but for small business owners and their employees. Only the employer can contribute to this plan, and contributions go into a SEP IRA for each employee rather than a trust fund. Self-employed individuals can also set up a SEP IRA. Contribution limits in 2020 are 25 percent of compensation or $57,000, whichever is less. Figuring out contribution limits for self-employed individuals is a bit more complicated . "It's very similar to a profit-sharing plan," says Littell, because contributions can be made at the discretion of the employer. Pros: For employees, this is a freebie retirement account. For self-employed individuals, the higher contribution limits make them much more attractive than a regular IRA. Cons: There's no certainty about how much employees will accumulate in this plan. Also, the money is more easily accessible. This can be viewed as more good than bad, but Littell views it as bad. What it means to you: Account holders are still tasked with making investment decisions. Resist the temptation to break open the account early. If you tap the money before age 59 1/2 , you'll likely have to pay a 10 percent penalty on top of income tax. SIMPLE IRA With 401(k) plans, employers have to pass several non-discrimination tests each year to make sure that highly compensated workers aren't contributing too much to the plan relative to the rank and file. The SIMPLE IRA bypasses those requirements because the same benefits are provided to all employees. The employer has a choice of whether to contribute a 3 percent match or make a 2 percent non-elective contribution even if the employee saves nothing in his or her own SIMPLE IRA. Pros: Littell says most SIMPLE IRAs are designed to provide a match, so they provide an opportunity for workers to make pre-tax salary deferrals and receive a matching contribution. To the employee, this plan doesn't look much different from a 401(k) plan. Cons: The employee contribution is limited to $13,500 for 2020, compared to $19,500 for other defined contribution plans. But most people don't contribute that much anyway, says Littell. What it means for you: As with other DC plans, employees have the same decisions to make: how much to contribute and how to invest the money. 3. Solo 401(k) plan Alternatively known as a Solo-k , Uni-k and One-participant k, the Solo 401(k) plan is designed for a business owner and his or her spouse. Because the business owner is both the employer and employee, elective deferrals of up to $19,500 can be made, plus a non-elective contribution of up to 25 percent of compensation up to a total annual contribution of $57,000 for incorporated businesses, not including catch-up contributions. The limit for unincorporated businesses is 20 percent, says Littell. Pros: "If you don't have other employees, a solo is better than a SIMPLE IRA because you can contribute more to it," says Littell. "The SEP is a little easier to set up and to terminate. So if you don't want to contribute more than 20 percent of your earnings, I would set up a SEP." However, if you want to set up your plan as a Roth, you can't do it in a SEP, but you can with a Solo-k. Cons: It's a bit more complicated to set up, and once assets exceed $250,000, you'll have to file an annual report on Form 5500-SE. What it means to you: If you have plans to expand and hire employees, this plan won't work . Once you hire other workers, the IRS mandates that they must be included in the plan if they meet eligibility requirements, and the plan will be subject to non-discrimination testing. 4. Pensions Pensions, more formally known as defined benefit (DB) plans, are the easiest to manage because so little is required of you. Pensions are fully funded by employers and provide a fixed monthly benefit to workers at retirement. But DB plans are on the endangered species list because fewer companies are offering them. Just 16 percent of Fortune 500 companies enticed workers with pension plans in 2017, down from 59 percent in 1998. Why? DB plans require the employer to make good on an expensive promise to fund a hefty sum for your retirement. Pensions, which are payable for life, usually replace a percentage of your pay based on your tenure and salary. A common formula is 1.5 percent of final average compensation multiplied by years of service, according to Littell. A worker with an average pay of $50,000 over a 25-year career, for example, would receive an annual pension payout of $18,750, or $1,562.50 a month. Pros: This benefit addresses longevity risk - or the risk of running out of money before you die. "If you understand that your company is providing a replacement of 30 percent to 40 percent of your pay for the rest of your life, plus you're getting 40 percent from Social Security, this provides a strong baseline of financial security," says Littell. "Additional savings can help but are not as central to your retirement security." Cons: Since the formula is generally tied to years of service and compensation, the benefit grows more rapidly at the end of your career. "If you were to change jobs or if the company were to terminate the plan before you hit retirement age, you can get a lot less than the benefit you originally expected," says Littell. What it means to you: Since company pensions are increasingly rare and valuable, if you are fortunate enough to have one, leaving the company can be a major decision. Should you stay or should you go? It depends on the financial strength of your employer, how long you've been with the company and how close you are to retiring. You can also factor in your job satisfaction and whether there are better employment opportunities elsewhere. 5. Guaranteed income annuities (GIAs) GIAs are generally not offered by employers, but individuals can buy these annuities to create their own pensions. You can trade a big lump sum at retirement and buy an immediate annuity to get a monthly payment for life, but most people aren't comfortable with this arrangement. More popular are deferred income annuities that are paid into over time. For example, at age 50, you can begin making premium payments until age 65, if that's when you plan to retire. "Each time you make a payment, it bumps up your payment for life," says Littell. You can buy these on an after-tax basis, in which case you'll owe tax only on the plan's earnings. Or you can buy it within an IRA and can get an upfront tax deduction, but the entire annuity would be taxable when you take withdrawals. Pros: Littell himself invested in a deferred income annuity to create an income stream for life. "It's very satisfying, it felt really good building a bigger pension over time," he says. Cons: If you're not sure when you're going to retire or even if you're going to retire, then it may not make sense. "You're also locking into a strategy that you can't get rid of," he says. What it means to you: You'll be getting bond-like returns and you lose the possibility of getting higher returns in the stock market in exchange for the guaranteed income. Since payments are for life you also get more payments (and a better overall return) if you live longer. "People forget that these decisions always involve a trade-off," Littell says. 6. Profit-sharing plans Some companies offer a profit-sharing plan to their workers as an incentive for them to be productive so that they can both help boost and share in the company's profits. This is another hands-off benefit, in the sense that you can't contribute to it; only the employer can. But here's the catch: your employer has discretion as to whether to contribute from year to year. However, the government does insist that contributions be " recurring and substantial ." Pros: "It doesn't cost you anything," says Littell. "In some profit-sharing plans you can choose the investments you want and in others, the trustees handle the investment decisions." Cons: Profit-sharing plans are not a fail-safe way to ensure your financial security. "It's difficult to predict how much benefit you're going to get in retirement," says Littell. "You don't know how much the company will contribute from year to year, and you don't know what the investment experience will be." What it means to you: When you're planning for retirement, it's a good idea to look at the history of company contributions to get a sense of what to expect. You don't have to make a lot of decisions unless the plan allows you to determine how to invest the money. One important caveat: "At the time of distribution, as with any account, you want to make sure it's rolled into an IRA so you defer income tax," says Littell. 7. The federal government plan The Federal Employees Retirement System, or FERS , offers a secure three-legged retirement-planning stool for civilian employees who meet certain service requirements: A basic defined benefit plan Social Security The Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP Only two of these are portable if you leave government work - Social Security and TSP , the latter of which is also available to members of the uniformed services. The TSP is a lot like a 401(k) plan on steroids. Participants choose from five low-cost investment options, including a bond fund, an S&P 500 index fund, a small-cap fund and an international stock fund   plus a fund that invests in specially issued Treasury securities. On top of that, federal workers can choose from among several lifecycle funds with different target retirement dates that invest in those core funds, making investment decisions relatively easy. Pros: Federal employees are eligible for the defined benefit plan. Plus they can get a 5 percent employer contribution to the TSP, which includes a 1 percent non-elective contribution, a dollar-for-dollar match for the next 3 percent and a 50 percent match for the next 2 percent contributed. "The formula is a bit complicated, but if you put in 5 percent, they put in 5 percent," says Littell. "Another positive is that the investment fees are shockingly low - four hundredths of a percentage point." That translates to 40 cents per $1,000 invested - much lower than you'll find elsewhere. Cons: As with all defined contribution plans, there's always uncertainty about what your account balance might be when you retire. What it means to you: You still need to decide how much to contribute, how to invest, and whether to make the Roth election. However, it makes a lot of sense to contribute at least 5 percent of your salary to get the maximum employer contribution. 8. Cash-balance plans This is a type of defined benefit, or pension plan, too. But instead of replacing a certain percentage of your income for life, you are promised a certain hypothetical account balance based on contribution credits and investment credits (e.g. annual interest). One common setup for cash-balance plans is a company contribution credit of 6 percent of pay plus a 5 percent annual investment credit, says Littell. The investment credits are a promise and are not based on actual contribution credits. For example, let's say a 5 percent return, or investment credit, is promised. If the plan assets earn more, the employer can decrease contributions. In fact, many companies that want to shed their traditional pension plan convert to a cash-balance plan because it allows them better control over the costs of the plan. Pros: It still provides a promised benefit, and you don't have to contribute anything to it. "There's a fair amount of certainty in how much you're going to get," says Littell. Also, if you do decide to switch jobs, your account balance is portable so you'll get whatever the account is worth on your way out the door of your old job. Cons: If the company changes from a generous pension plan to a cash-balance plan, older workers can potentially lose out, though some companies will grandfather long-term employees into the original plan. Also, the investment credits are relatively modest, typically 4 percent or 5 percent. "It becomes a conservative part of your portfolio," says Littell. What it means to you: The date you retire will impact your benefit. "Retiring early can truncate your benefit," says Littell. Working longer is more advantageous. Also, you'll get to choose from a lump sum or an annuity form of benefit. When given the option between a $200,000 lump sum or a monthly annuity check of $1,000 for life, "too many people," choose the lump sum when they'd be better off getting the annuity for life, says Littell. If you're married and don't want to leave your spouse in the lurch -- in the event you predecease him or her -- consider a joint-life annuity rather than a single-life annuity. 9. Cash-value life insurance plan Some companies offer insurance vehicles as a benefit. There are various types: whole life, variable life, universal life and variable universal life. They provide a death benefit while at the same time building cash value, which could support your retirement needs. If you withdraw the cash value, the premiums you paid - your cost basis - come out first and are not subject to tax. "There are some similarities to the Roth tax treatment, but more complicated," says Littell. "You don't get a deduction on the way in, but if properly designed you can get tax-free withdrawals on the way out." Pros: It addresses multiple risks by providing either a death benefit or a source of income. Plus, you get tax deferral on the growth of your investment. Cons: "If you don't do it right, if the policy lapses, you end up with a big tax bill," he adds. Like other insurance solutions, once you buy it, you are more or less locked into the strategy for the long term. Another risk is that the products don't always perform as well as the illustrations might show that they will. What it means to you: These products are for wealthier people who have already maxed out all other retirement savings vehicles. If you've reached the contribution limits for your 401(k) and your IRA, then you might consider investing in this type of life insurance. 10. Nonqualified deferred compensation plans (NQDC) Unless you're a top executive in the C-suite, you can pretty much forget about being offered an NQDC plan . But we can wistfully check them out. Littell says there are two main types: One looks like a 401(k) plan with salary deferrals and a company match, the other is solely funded by the employer. The catch is that most often the latter one is not really funded. The employer puts in writing a "mere promise to pay" and may make bookkeeping entries and set aside funds, but those funds are subject to claims by creditors. Pros: The benefit is you can save money on a tax-deferred basis, but the employer can't take a tax deduction for its contribution until you start paying income tax on withdrawals. Cons: They don't offer as much security. "There's some risk that you won't get your payments (from an NQDC plan) if the company has financial problems," says Littell. What it means to you: For executives with access to an NQDC plan in addition to a 401(k) plan, Littell's advice is to max out the 401(k) contributions first. Then if the company is financially secure, contribute to the NQDC plan if it's set up like a 401(k) with a match.

You might not think that it's possible to catch a scary disease like tuberculosis or the plague, but new cases are reported in the United States every year. 20 Scariest Diseases You Can Catch in America's Cities 27,016. That's the population density (inhabitants per square mile) of New York City, per the latest census figures. San Francisco: 18,679. Chicago: 11,868. For contrast, less-urban American locales like Duluth, Minnesota, or Portsmouth, New Hampshire have population densities of just over 1,000. In other words, city denizens truly are living on top of each other and, in every instance, it's a veritable, festering petri dish. From tuberculosis germs to flesh-eating bacteria to pathogens of the plague (yes, that plague), the urban environs of America are rife with terrifying diseases. Don't believe us? Scroll on, and see for yourself. We've rounded up all the scariest diseases plaguing American cities. So ready the Purell or, better yet: catch a train straight to the countryside. And for ways to avoid bringing even more deadly diseases home, here are 30 Smart Ways to Avoid Getting Sick When You Travel. 1. Enterovirus D68 First identified in the United States in 1962, Enterovirus D68 or EV-D68 is a member of the enterovirus family, which also houses poliovirus. People who become infected with this virus experience symptoms similar to the common cold, like a runny nose and a fever, but can also suffer from more serious complications like difficulty breathing. Though few cases of this virus are typically seen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2014 saw a climbing number of instances, with 1,153 people in places like New York and Los Angeles having confirmed respiratory illnesses as a result of EV-D68. This infection is most commonly spread in the summer and fall, so make sure to always be thoroughly washing your hands. And for more amazing health advice, learn the 25 Subtle Ways Your Body Is Saying, "Go to the Doctor!" 2. Measles Thanks to modern medicine, rubeola more commonly known as "the measles" has all but disappeared in the United States. But recently the country has seen as many as 205 cases per year, as according to the CDC, unvaccinated people who travel internationally continue to bring the disease back home and cause outbreaks. (In 2013, Brooklyn suffered an outbreak of the disease that infected 58 people, all thanks to one traveler.) The infection is most commonly seen in children unfortunately, they are also the most likely to die from it. 3. Clostridium Difficle Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile for short, is a bacterium that affects the colon and causes inflammation, or colitis. People with a C. difficile infection experience painful symptoms like watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain and many end up in the hospital due to dehydration. Disturbingly enough, you're most likely to become infected with C. difficile while taking antibiotics, as this is when the number of infection-fighting agents in your body are lowest. When you're taking medications, be sure to avoid coming into contact with surfaces potentially contaminated with feces (like a subway pole or a public restroom sink). 4. Necrotizing Fasciitis The bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis enter the body through wounds like minor cuts and abrasions. Once inside the body, these bacteria infiltrate the superficial fascia just below the skin, causing symptoms like severe pain and redness. The infection advances rapidly, so within three or four days, people with it will see blisters and tissue death where there once was little more than a harmless bug bite. Because this disease progresses so quickly and is often not caught in time to be treated, it often leads to the loss of limbs, and can even be fatal. In fact, from 2003 to 2013, 9,871 people died as a result of necrotizing fasciitis in the United States alone. Several types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis and since public transportation is teeming with them, it's important to watch out for open wounds when traveling through the city. 5. Legionnaires' Disease Legionnaires' disease is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, which lives in water systems like air conditioners and grocery store mist sprayers. Similar to other types of pneumonia, this disease manifests in symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, fever, and muscle aches but while the death rate for all types of pneumonia is 5 percent, that number is at 10 percent for this specific lung infection. What's more, this disease has been spotted in recent years everywhere from the Bronx to Southern California, making it one of the scariest city diseases to watch out for. And if you're feeling under the weather, try out these 25 Amazingly Effective Sore Throat Remedies You Didn't Know Existed. 6. Tuberculosis Of all the diseases caused by a single infectious agent, tuberculosis (TB) is the second largest killer on a global scale, accounting for 1.8 million deaths in 2015. And in 2016, cities all across the country saw cases well above the national average, with San Francisco in particular reporting 11.5 TB cases per 100,000 people. 7. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease If the name of this disease looks familiar, it's probably because doctors have been seeing so many cases of it recently. And though the disease normally affects young children, even adults (like New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard ) can contract it, so both you and your children should be on the lookout. Symptoms include a sore throat and a characteristic blistery rash on the fingers, the inside of the cheeks, and the soles of the feet (ergo, hand, foot, and mouth). 8. Septicemia Though, disgustingly enough, you can get them from the subway, staph infections are relatively harmless if caught early. However, if they're left to their own devices, such infections can enter into the bloodstream and cause septicemia, or blood poisoning, which is a far more serious problem. When staph bacteria enters the blood, it affects major organs like the brain, heart, and lungs and nearly 17 percent of people who develop septicemia die as a result of it. 9. Mumps Though a vaccine for mumps has been around since 1967, outbreaks of the disease have already been reported in 47 of the 50 states in 2018, with 1,665 cases reported to the CDC. The virus that causes this disease is easily spread via coughing or even talking, which makes people in close proximity to one another (roommates, transit commuters) especially susceptible. The most well-known symptom of mumps is a swollen jaw, but other warning signs include a fever, muscle aches, and swollen salivary glands. Usually mumps do not cause serious complications, but they have been known to result in everything from meningitis to hearing loss. 10. Chagas Disease Chagas disease is a parasitic disease spread by the triatomine bug, more commonly known as the kissing bug. Though the disease was originally thought to only exist in Mexico, Central America, and South America, several cases have been reported in the United States in recent years, especially in Texas and the South. The migration of this disease to America is especially unfortunate, seeing as it causes nearly 12,000 deaths per year in Latin America via heart complications. Given how much damage the kissing bug can do, it's no surprise that it's one of The 35 Most Dangerous Bugs in America. 11. Salmonella When researchers from the University of Maryland tested the feces of 416 New York City mice, they found strains of Salmonella bacteria, which, if they get into a food supply, can cause salmonella poisoning. Though salmonella poisoning is usually beatable without treatment, the not-so-pleasant symptoms include diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, and in severe cases dehydration. 12. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever In 2017, the CDC estimated that the chances of finding Ae. aegypti mosquitos were especially high in warm cities like Miami, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The problem? These mosquitos carry the dengue virus, which can develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever and cause low blood platelet levels and circulatory system failure. 13. Hansen's Disease Hansen's disease, formerly known as leprosy, saw more than 200,000 new cases worldwide in 2016, with about 250 of those occurring in America. And while many cases seen in the states are the result of traveling, one study published in JAMA Dermatology found that there have been three different incidences of Hansen's disease in New York City in which the patients never left the country. Though the disease is curable, it leaves its victims with long-term issues like paralysis and blindness. 14. Chikungunya Similar to dengue, chikungunya is a prominently Southern city disease spread through the saliva of mosquitos. Within days of being bitten, people infected with the chikungunya virus will experience a fever, headaches, muscle pain, and joint swelling. For most people, chikungunya is not life-threatening or even too serious, but young children, older adults, and people with certain medical conditions are hit much harder when they get infected. 15. MRSA Short for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA is a type of antibiotic-resistant staph infection that especially plagues people in populated areas. Typically, the infection begins as an aching red bump that looks like a spider bite and, if left untreated, the bacteria will make their way inside the body, causing bone, joint, and bloodstream infections that can be fatal. And for more symptoms that could mean something serious, check out the 23 Cancer Warning Signs Hiding in Plain Sight. 16. Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxic shock syndrome is another fatal condition you can get from staph bacteria. Though it's regularly associated with tampon use (most commonly from leaving it in too long or using a super absorbent brand), the complication can occur in people of all ages and genders, so long as they have a skin wound through which bacteria can enter. Signs of toxic shock syndrome include vomiting, confusion, a sunburn-like rash, and muscle aches and if you're experiencing any of these symptoms and also have an infected wound, then it's important to call your doctor immediately. 17. HIV/AIDS HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, destroys the white blood cells inside your body that fight off infections, making the body a breeding ground for disease. And according to the CDC, the majority of HIV diagnoses in the United States are found in urban areas, making this disease a threat to city slickers. If left untreated, a person with an HIV infection might also develop AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, which leaves the body especially vulnerable to what are known as opportunistic infections. 18. Plague Let's start with good news: According to the CDC, only about seven human plague cases are reported each year in the United States. The bad news? If you happen to be one of the seven people infected with the plague bacteria, you might experience limb loss or respiratory failure. The bacteria that causes this disease is spread via the fleas of rodents, so living in the city puts you especially at risk. 19. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) Rodents are to thank for yet another deadly disease plaguing the United States. Found in people infected with hantavirus, this respiratory disease causes coughing and shortness of breath, with one survivor of the often-fatal illness describing the feeling of the disease to be like a "tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face." 20. E.Coli As if commuting wasn't bad enough already, one study from Columbia's Center for Infection and Immunity found that the rats running around all five boroughs of New York City were carrying strains of the bacteria E. coli. If and when these pathogens find their way into the citizens of the city, they result in everything from painful diarrhea to life-threatening complications.To discover more amazing secrets about living your best life, click here to sign up for our FREE daily newsletter!

It features a comfortable, placid ride and an excellent predicted reliability rating. However, handling is dull, the base engine is weak, and there are few available features.	The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox sits in the top third of the compact SUV class. It features a comfortable, placid ride and an excellent predicted reliability rating. However, handling is dull, the base engine is weak, and there are few available features. Is the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox a Good Used SUV? The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox is a good compact SUV . Its spacious interior and flexible rear seats make it a great choice for families. The ride itself is comfortable and quiet, and the Equinox receives some of the highest predicted reliability and safety scores in the class. No vehicle is perfect, though. The Equinox's handling is dull, and its base engine is underpowered. There's a lot to like, but there are lots of good SUVs in this class. Shop around before committing to this Chevy. Why You Can Trust Us Our used car rankings and reviews are based on our analysis of professional automotive reviews, as well as data like crash test scores, reliability ratings, and ownership expenses. We researched 59 Chevrolet Equinox reviews to help you decide if it's the right used car for you. The U.S. News Best Cars team has been ranking cars, trucks, and SUVs since 2007, and our staff has a combined 75 years of automotive industry experience. To ensure our impartiality, our staff never takes expensive gifts or trips from car companies, and an outside team handles the advertising on our site. How Much Is the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox? Our site has nearly 2,200 listings for the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox. Prices range from $17,700 to $26,500, with the average list price sitting at $21,100. Your final price will depend on the model you choose, as well as its condition, mileage, location, and features. How Much Does the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Cost to Own? For a used 2017 Chevrolet Equinox, estimated five-year costs for gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs come out to about $25,200. That's on the high end for the class. The same expenses for the Mazda CX-5 are projected to be $23,100; for the Honda CR-V , they're $20,940. Is It Better to Buy a Used or New Chevrolet Equinox? Pricing for a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox starts at $23,580   about $2,400 more than the average list price of a 2017 Equinox. That isn't a lot of additional cash considering that the 2018 model is fully redesigned and includes a host of new standard features, like Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, a proximity key, push-button start, and Chevy's Teen Driver system. The 2018 Chevy Equinox is also smaller and lighter than its predecessor, and it gets slightly better gas mileage. If the new model is within your budget, it's the superior option. If the 2018 Equinox isn't in your price point, but you still want a new vehicle, there are quite a few options priced similarly to a used 2017 Equinox. The 2018 Hyundai Tucson starts at $22,550 and delivers a comfortable ride and great safety and predicted reliability ratings. If you're willing to drop down a class to subcompact SUVs   and don't mind losing some cargo space and second-row legroom   you'll find a number of choices that may suit your needs. The 2018 Honda HR-V starts at $19,670. It has an adult-friendly second row and a flexible cargo space. The 2018 Hyundai Kona (starting at $19,500) has less cargo and passenger space, but its driving dynamics are superb. The 2018 Mazda CX-3 is also sporty, and it starts at $20,110. Which Model Year of the Chevrolet Equinox Is Best? The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox is the last model year of a generation that launched in 2010. You can save money by shopping for a 2015 Equinox. It's the first model that came with standard OnStar and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot. Otherwise, it's the same as the 2016 and 2017 Equinox models. How Reliable Is the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox? The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox earns a predicted reliability rating of 4.5 out of five from J.D. Power. That score is among the best in the industry. 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Recalls As of this writing, the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox has no reported recalls. See more information on Chevrolet Equinox safety recalls » Which Used Chevrolet Equinox Model Is Right for Me? Four trims are available: L (base), LS, LT, and Premier. The base Chevrolet Equinox L comes with a 7-inch touch screen, Bluetooth phone connectivity, OnStar, and a Wi-Fi hot spot with 4G LTE. To get available all-wheel drive, upgrade to the Chevrolet Equinox LS. It also comes with satellite radio, but there are few other standard add-ons. Because of the lower trims' underpowered engines and limited optional features, most shoppers should select a higher trim level. The Chevrolet Equinox LT is a great value, has an available V6 engine, and offers more options than lower trims. In fact, if you want advanced safety features beyond the standard rearview camera, the Chevy Equinox LT is the lowest trim available with them. The top-of-the-line Chevrolet Equinox Premier adds leather upholstery, heated front seats, automatic climate control, and a power driver's seat. However, it still doesn't come with features like a navigation system or an upgraded stereo, which most rivals include as standard in the top trim level. Certified Pre-Owned Chevrolet Equinox Warranty Even with the Equinox's solid predicted reliability score, a certified pre-owned model is worth considering. Chevrolet's CPO program is one of the best among competing brands, though GMC' s and Buick 's are just as appealing. For its certified pre-owned vehicles, Chevy extends the original new-car powertrain warranty to six years or 100,000 miles and provides a one-year/12,000-mile bumper-to-bumper limited warranty. Chevrolet CPO vehicles must pass a 172-point inspection. Additional benefits like towing and roadside assistance may be available, so read Chevy's warranty page carefully. How Safe Is the Equinox? The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox has a strong safety score for the class. It earned a Good rating (the best possible) in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration evaluations, the 2017 Equinox received four (out of five) stars for overall safety. It earned four stars in frontal and rollover crash tests, and five stars in the side crash test. A rearview camera comes standard. Available features include blind spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision alert, and lane departure warning. 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Versus the Competition Which Is Better: 2017 Chevrolet Equinox or 2017 Hyundai Tucson? The Hyundai Tucson is one of the highest-rated compact SUVs in our rankings. In addition to its quiet, roomy interior and strong safety and predicted reliability scores, it has a few advantages over the Equinox. Among them is it's available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, which the Equinox doesn't introduce until the 2018 model year. The Tucson also has better gas mileage than the Equinox, as well as more composed handling. Which Is Better: 2017 Chevrolet Equinox or 2017 Mazda CX-5? In terms of performance, there are few options within the class that are as fun to drive as the smooth-riding, agile-handling Mazda CX-5 . It also gets better fuel economy and has more driver assistance features than the Equinox. Inside, its handsome cabin features a user-friendly infotainment system and spacious back seats. However, the Equinox might be a more practical option for families, due to its higher predicted reliability rating and lower average list price. It also has more cargo capacity than the CX-5, though many competitors' cargo holds top the Equinox's storage space. 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Performance How Does the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Drive? The 2017 Equinox is powered by a 182-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a six-speed automatic transmission. There is sufficient power for local travel, but acceleration feels sluggish on the highway. The stronger available 301-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine is better-suited for highway speeds. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. The Chevy Equinox has a smooth, comfortable ride. When turning corners, however, its steering is dull and detached. Does the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Get Good Gas Mileage? The base Equinox gets typical EPA-estimated gas mileage for the class: 21 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway. Fuel economy drops to 17/24 mpg city/highway with the available six-cylinder engine. 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Interior How Many People Does the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Seat? The 2-row Chevrolet Equinox seats five on cloth upholstery. The Equinox has more interior space than many rivals, and its front seats provide all-day comfort. There's ample legroom in the rear, and the seats slide and recline for additional comfort and flexibility. The cabin is fairly attractive and well-designed, though its materials aren't as high-quality as rivals'. The center stack is within close reach of the driver, but its abundance of buttons results in a cluttered dashboard. How Many Car Seats Fit in the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox? Each of the rear outboard seats in the Equinox has a complete set of LATCH connectors for installing child safety seats. The IIHS gave the Equinox a rating of Acceptable (the second-highest rating) for the system's ease of use. 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Features Standard features include a USB port and an audio system with a 7-inch touch screen, Bluetooth phone connectivity, and OnStar with 4G LTE and a built-in Wi-Fi hot spot. Available features include automatic climate control, a power sunroof, remote start, an eight-speaker Pioneer sound system, Bluetooth audio, satellite radio, smartphone app integration, a Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system, and a navigation system. The Equinox's infotainment system can be slow to respond to inputs, but it's easy to use and allows you to organize on-screen menus to your liking. 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Dimensions Chevrolet Equinox Cargo Space Behind its second row, the Equinox has 31.5 cubic feet of cargo space. That space expands to 63.7 cubic feet with the second row folded. That's below average for the class, as most competitors offer more than 70 cubic feet of overall cargo space. 2017 Equinox Length and Weight The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox is about 15.7 feet long. Its curb weight ranges from 3,764 pounds to 4,168 pounds, depending on the trim and powertrain. Where Was the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox Built? Chevrolet built the 2017 Equinox in Canada and Tennessee.

Video by CNBC Jay Leno got rich by being America's class clown. The comedian has an estimated net worth of $350 million, largely thanks to his tenure as the host of The Tonight Show, which he left in 2014. He's still cracking jokes, but now he does it on Jay Leno's Garage , which started as a web series and is now in its fourth season on CNBC (airing Thursdays). It follows Leno's one true splurge: collecting prized and pricey cars. We talked to him about the money tips he's picked up from his auto obsession, how he started his standup career homeless, and the one thing he tells every comic who's trying to make a buck telling jokes. You were extremely scrappy when you started in comedy. In Leading with My Chin , you wrote about being homeless and telling jokes to police when they picked you up off the street. [Laughs] Yeah, I did. I just got on a plane one day and went to Los Angeles. I looked in the paper for open houses, say, from noon to 4 p.m., and I would get there at 3:30, and then I would hide in the closet. The realtor would leave and lock the door, and now I had a place to stay. Sometimes I could stay in a house two to three days. I didn't wreck anything. I did get picked up twice for vagrancy on Hollywood Boulevard. In fact, where I got my [Walk of Fame] star was where the cops picked me up. They'd put you in the back of the car, and they'd drive you around their entire shift, and then let you out in the morning. They must've been used to that on Hollywood Boulevard. I would tell the cops jokes, and most of the cops are pretty blue-collar guys. Once they realized you're not dangerous, you're not a crazy person… "You find a place to live yet? No? Okay, get in the back." It was okay. They were nice guys. How'd you become a car geek, anyway? I grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, which was a pretty rural area when I was a kid. There were always broken tractors, lawn mowers, vehicles you had to fix. I remember somebody had abandoned an old Renault in a field when we were about 11 or 12. We would drive it around the backyard. Your mom would kind of watch through the window. Of, course now they'd call child services, and the parents would be taken away. Back then, it was seen as not a bad thing it taught you how to fix cars and get things running. I never set out to collect cars. I just bought what I liked. The general rule of car collecting is if you're reasonably astute and you understand how things work, if you like it, chances are other people will like it, too. My three things are: It should be of technical and historical significance. It should be fun to drive. And it should be attractive to look at. If an automobile has those three qualifications, then it's probably something that would be considered collectible. There's a lot of speculation out there about your vast car collection. Exactly how many do you own? About 181 cars, and about 160 motorcycles. Do you have any idea what they're all worth? No. I know individual ones. I bought a McLaren F1 in '99 for $800,000, and the last offer I got was $17.5 million. They only built 64 of them. Are there any cars you look back on and think, "I wish I hadn't bought that"? There's this thing in the car world: "You didn't pay too much, you just bought it too soon." There are a couple there. I don't really dwell on them too much. If you buy something that's rare and valuable, it will always be rare and valuable. How often do you sell the cars? I've never sold a car [Laughs]. Ever ? I will donate a car to charity. We've done that probably 10 or 15 times. Your passion for cars is palpable. Is there anything else you don't mind dropping serious dough on? You know, there's really not. It's obviously not clothes. I'm not an experienced person. I know I'm pretty wealthy, but I live like someone who's on their last dime. I take nothing for granted. I don't take vacations. When you're in show business, you get to go to vacation places. I enjoy doing philanthropy stuff. I like feeling like if I don't work this week, I'm gonna go broke. People say, "Why do you work all the time?" I go, "What do I do on a Tuesday that's worth this kind of money?" A job comes up, and I always feel like I was broke for so long, I never wanted to be in the position of, "Well, how much is that job? Oh no, I'm not…" It just seems so presumptuous to turn down. You still have that hustler mentality. Yeah, and I like being a piecemeal comic, the idea of write joke, tell joke, get check. I don't do HBO or Netflix specials because I can make almost the same money doing a live show. Why not just do four or five live shows instead of giving something away on TV? So no eight-figure Netflix special for you. It doesn't interest me. I'm not saying that to be snobby. It just doesn't appeal to me because once your joke is on TV, it disappears forever. I always think, "Did this person just hear me say this last night?" I always know where my act is. I control it. You came into quite a lot of money as a famous comedian. What did you learn about spending money from that? I never spent money before I had it. I never bought anything before I could afford it. I never bought anything on time. I don't lease vehicles. Cash is king. You're not risky with your income. I work and my money relaxes that's the way I look at it. I live pretty frugally. I'm a huge believer in low self-esteem. The only ones with high self-esteem are actors and criminals. I'm dyslexic. My mother would say, "You're gonna have to work twice as hard as the other kid to get the same thing," and that always seemed like a fair tradeoff. The nice thing about being dyslexic people tend to focus on something and then that becomes their goal. That always worked pretty well for me. I've always had two jobs, and I lived on one job and banked the other. All through The Tonight Show, I never touched a dime of my TV money because TV money is fleeting money. When you're a comedian, you can always generate income. You can always stand somewhere and tell jokes and get paid for it. In college I would go to what they used to call hootenanny night and I would put $50 on the bar. I would say to the bartender, "Let me go up and tell jokes. If I do good, give me my $50 back. If I do bad, you keep the $50." Eventually you could make $15, $20 bucks a night by doing that. What do you say when you talk to a young comedian who's coming up and reaching for the kind of career you've had? My advice is just take the job. Don't worry about how much it pays. I'm always astounded when I meet comedians who go, "I'm not going there for that kind of money," and I go, "Who are you? You haven't done anything. No one knows who you are." If you're any good, the money will come. Pay attention to your product. If you're not making enough money, it's 'cause you're not good enough. I spent almost a year at the Comedy Store asking to go on after Richard Pryor. No one wanted to follow Pryor because he just blew the room out. He was really the best. After that, I realized I didn't have an hour of material. I had about 18 minutes of really funny material. I just kept throwing out everything that wasn't funny.

Audi considers it a crossover, but the E-Tron Quattro's low ride height and sloping roofline gives it more of a wagonlike appearance. Using a 95-kW-hr battery pack and three electric motors, the E-Tron Quattro will be about as quick as the Jaguar I-Pace. Audi also says owners will be able to charge their E-Tron in less than 30 minutes at a 150-kW charger.

The Q3 is also more spacious than before. A large touchscreen and an even larger instrument display come standard. Several driver-assist features are available, as well. Initially, Audi will offer four engines in Europe, but we don't know which will come to the U.S. Also Consider Jaguar E-Pace, Lexus UX , Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class Sum Up The next generation of Audi's smallest crossover Base Engine 2.0L/190-hp/236-lb-ft turbo I-4* Audi Q3 Base Engine 2.0L/190-hp/236-lb-ft turbo I-4* Opt Engine 2.0L/230-hp/258-lb-ft turbo I-4* Drivetrain Front-engine, FWD/AWD, 7-sp twin-cl auto* Towing 1,500 lb* Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 18.7/53.9 cu ft* EPA Econ City/Hwy 19-21/27-29 mpg* 0-60 mph 6.5-8.0 sec* Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles IntelliChoice 5-Yr Retained Value 52% *Estimated Research the Audi Q3 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi Q3 near you Audi Q5 Base Price $42,500-$55,500 Body Type SUV Unchanged The Q5 was redesigned last year, so although Audi might add standard features or new colors for 2019, expect any changes to be minimal at best. We're big fans of the well-designed cabin, spacious interior, and high-tech Virtual Cockpit. Attractive styling helps it stand out in a crowded segment. The base four-cylinder pulls hard with minimal turbo lag, and the SQ5 hits 60 mph in 5.0 seconds. Also Consider BMW X3, Alfa Romeo Stelvio , Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Sum Up A stylish standout among compact crossovers Audi Q5 Base Engine 2.0L/252-hp/273-lb-ft turbo I-4 Opt Engine 3.0L/354-hp/369-lb-ft turbo V-6 Drivetrain Front-engine, AWD, 7-sp twin-cl auto/8A Towing 4,400 lb Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 26.8/60.4 cu ft EPA Econ City/Hwy 19-23/24-27 mpg 0-60 mph 5.0-5.9 sec Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles Safety NHTSA: 5 Stars IIHS: TSP IntelliChoice 5-Yr Retained Value 51% Research the Audi Q5 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi Q5 near you Audi Q7 Base Price $51,000* Body Type SUV Unchanged Audi redesigned its large seven-passenger crossover for 2017, giving the Q7 a high-end interior, lots of technology, and impressive handling for an SUV its size. Like last year, though, don't expect Audi to make major changes to the tech-laden Q7. Then again, although we'd appreciate a more spacious third row, the Q7 doesn't need many updates to hold its own against the competition. Also Consider Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class , BMW X7 , Volvo XC90 Audi Q7 Base Engine 2.0L/252-hp/273-lb-ft turbo I-4 Opt Engine 3.0L/333-hp/325-lb-ft s'ch'd V-6 Drivetrain Front-engine, AWD, 8A Towing 7,700 lb Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 14.8/71.6 cu ft EPA Econ City/Hwy 19/25 mpg 0-60 mph 5.4-7.0 sec Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles Safety NHTSA: 5 Stars IntelliChoice 5-Yr Retained Value 51% Research the Audi Q7 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi Q7 near you Audi Q8 Base Price $65,000* Body Type SUV All-New The Q7 is already large and luxurious enough for most buyers, but Audi went further with the Q8. The large notch-backed crossover is designed to be an alternative to the A8 for style-conscious buyers who no longer want a sedan. It's also wider, lower, and shorter than the Q7, giving the Q8 a high-riding hatch look. The cabin borrows heavily from the A8, surrounding all five passengers in minimalist luxury. Also Consider BMW X6 , Land Rover Range Rover Sport, Porsche Cayenne Sum Up Audi's answer to a super-niche segment Audi Q8 Base Engine 3.0L turbo V-6 + elec, 340 hp/369 lb-ft comb Opt Engine None Drivetrain Front-engine, AWD, 8A Towing N/A Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 21.4/62.0 cu ft EPA Econ City/Hwy 20/27 mpg* 0-60 mph 5.0 sec* Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles *Estimated Research the Audi Q8 on MSN Autos | Find an Audi Q8 near you Bentley Bentayga Base Price $180,000-$236,000* Body Type SUV Major Two engine options have been added: a twin-turbo V-8 and a plug-in hybrid, making this the first Bentley to offer an electrified powertrain. The lithium-ion battery on the Bentayga plug-in can be recharged in 2.5 hours. In addition to the four main drive modes, three E modes allow it to operate in hybrid, EV, or Hold mode, the latter of which saves the battery for later use.

Underpinned by the UKL platform, the X1 is a rare front-drive-based vehicle to wear the BMW badge and shares its powertrain with the Mini Clubman and Countryman. Folks have been waiting for an M Performance model more power, a sportier suspension setup, and stickier tires but BMW has not confirmed its existence. Also Consider Audi Q3 , Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, Lexus UX Sum Up BMW's small SUV maintains the brand's flair BMW X1 Base Engine 2.0L/228-hp/258-lb-ft turbo I-4 Opt Engine None Drivetrain Front-engine, FWD/AWD, 8A Towing N/A Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 27.1/58.7 cu ft EPA Econ City/Hwy 22-23/31-32 mpg 0-60 mph 6.8-7.0 sec* Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles Safety NHTSA: 5 Stars IntelliChoice 5-Yr Retained Value 50% *Estimated Research the BMW X1 on MSN Autos | Find a BMW X1 near you BMW X2 Base Price $37,500-$39,500* Body Type SUV Unchanged All-new last year, this tall hatchback isn't expected to get many changes in standard form. However, an M Performance model wearing the M35i badge is expected sometime soon and could be powered by an upgraded version of the 2.0-liter turbo I-4 expected to make around 300 hp. The X2 M35i will likely come with performance tires and a stiffer chassis for improved handling.

On top of the existing M40i, a full-fledged X3 M powered by the same twin-turbo I-6 found in the M3 and M4 is expected to arrive soon. The X3 M should get more go-fast bits, such as adaptive suspension with its own unique calibration, an active M differential, and a performance-oriented all-wheel-drive system. Also Consider Volvo XC60, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class, Audi Q5 Sum Up A potent, dynamic family hauler BMW X3 Base Engine 2.0L/248-hp/258-lb-ft turbo I-4 Opt Engine 3.0L/355-hp/369-lb-ft turbo I-6; 3.0L/425-hp/406-lb-ft twin-turbo I-6* Drivetrain Front-engine, RWD/AWD, 8A Towing 4,400 lb Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 28.7/62.7 cu ft EPA Econ City/Hwy 16-23/22-30 mpg 0-60 mph 4.0-6.3 sec* Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles Safety IIHS: TSP+ IntelliChoice 5-Yr Retained Value 51% *Estimated Research the BMW X3 on MSN Autos | Find a BMW X3 near you BMW X4 Base Price $51,445-$61,445 Body Type SUV Major The second-gen X4 arrives for 2019, slotting above the X3 as one of the sportier crossovers in BMW's lineup. Like its predecessor, the new X4 has a sloping roofline, so it's harder to see out of and crimps second-row headroom. A full-fledged M variant above the M40i is likely in a couple years, with the same engine as the M3 and M4, a retuned suspension, and a performance-oriented AWD system. Also Consider Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, Jaguar F-Pace, Land Rover Range Rover Velar Sum Up Less practical but still a crossover BMW X4 Base Engine 2.0L/248-hp/258-lb-ft turbo I-4 Opt Engine 3.0L/355-hp/365-lb-ft turbo I-6 Drivetrain Front-engine, AWD, 8A Towing 3,500 lb* Max Cargo, Seats Up/Down 18.5/50.5 cu ft EPA Econ City/Hwy 16-22/22-29 mpg 0-60 mph 4.6-5.8 sec* Basic Warranty 4 years/50,000 miles IntelliChoice 5-Yr Retained Value 51% *Estimated Research the BMW X4 on MSN Autos | Find a BMW X4 near you BMW X5 Base Price $61,695-$76,745 Body Type SUV Major The new X5 arrives in early 2019, slightly larger and featuring a cleaner exterior design than its predecessor. Like the outgoing model, it can be had with seating for up to seven passengers and retains the two-section tailgate. Eventually the gas-powered models will be joined by a plug-in hybrid, a diesel variant, and the high-performance X5 M, which should get the twin-turbo V-8 from the M5 sedan.

Expect the same gas engine options as the redesigned X5 and a high-performance X6 M to follow. There could also be a plug-in hybrid, which should use the same system found in the 530e iPerformance sedan, as well as a rear-drive variant. Until then, the X6 holds steady.

A look at good freezing, canning, and storage practices can be key to helping preserve fresh food for as long as possible to make the most of a household budget.	Eaters on a budget can do more than rethink what they buy for dinner   they can think about using their kitchen more, and using it more wisely when they do. A look at good freezing, canning, and storage practices can be key to helping preserve fresh food for as long as possible to make the most of a household budget. Stock Up and Save Frugal consumers are always looking for tips and tricks to help cut food costs and waste, and many of these come down to smart storage. Storing food properly allows budget-minded shoppers to buy items in bulk at a lower cost, for example. Keeping fresh produce in good condition for as long as possible is also a key to stretching food dollars and making fewer trips to the store   especially these days when we're trying to spend more time at home and store more food than usual. These 50 food storage tips are designed to help consumers spend less and enjoy more. Related: 10 Pantry and Freezer Staples Worth Buying in Bulk Use Reusable Containers Many foods stay fresh longer when not stored in the original packaging. Keeping an assortment of sizes of food-grade plastic or glass containers (style and prices vary) provides an easy way to store all kinds of bulk food   from grains and flours to dehydrated meals and dried legumes, as well as spices and other powders. Freeze Seasonal Produce Fresh produce is cheapest and has the most nutrition and flavor in season. Take time to freeze fruits and vegetables properly to save money during colder months when produce prices rise. Freeze Food Scraps for Stock Instead of throwing away the ends of onions, carrots, and celery, toss them in a freezer bag along with mushroom stems, stray garlic cloves, and herb stems. When the bag is full, use it to make a flavorful broth or stock from ingredients that otherwise would've wound up in the garbage. Related: 10 Easy-to-Make Foods to Stop Buying at the Store Freeze Homemade Stock in Cubes Having access to small amounts of homemade stock and broth can be a real timesaver. If stored in one big container, it's difficult to add just a cup or a few tablespoons to a recipe. Instead, freeze stock in ice cube trays and store in plastic storage bags for easy use anytime, no matter how much or how little the recipe calls for. Related: 10 Cheap and Easy Soup Recipes Buy Dry Beans Dried beans are cheaper by volume, easier to stack in large amounts, and more shelf stable than canned beans. Buying this nutritious and versatile staple in bulk also reduces the cost to pennies per serving. Related: 12 Tasty Bean Recipes Try Produce-Preserving Sheets Sheets sold under the label Fenugreen FreshPaper are designed to line produce drawers in the fridge and help keep fruits and vegetables fresh up to four times longer. Many consumers reviewing the product confirm that the sheets help extend the life of produce, reducing waste significantly. Shoppers must decide if that's worth a price of $10 for eight sheets . Store Butter on the Counter Although most Americans store butter in the fridge, keeping butter on the counter is typical in many parts of the world. Room-temperature butter is easier to spread on toast, meaning less could be used overall, saving more. Just be sure to use within a few days and keep stored properly   for instance, in a French butter bell . Look to the Basement Basements tend to be one of the most temperature-stable spaces in the house, because they lie mostly underground. Use a dark and cool corner of the basement to store root vegetables bought on sale. Store produce in mesh bags to allow air circulate and reduce the risk of unwanted pests. Store Open Packages in Containers Use food storage bags or other containers to stay organized; avoid spills and waste from open bags of staples, such as flour, sugar, and tea; and keep bugs out of food. Organize Cupboards and Pantry If you can't find an ingredient, you are likely spend money on something you already have. Keep like items together and store things with a common purpose together. For example, keep tea and honey in the same cupboard, and keep baking ingredients together in the pantry. Reuse Empty Jars Storing food in jars has a lot of benefits that translate into savings. Use old jars that once contained sauce, pickles, jam, or other foods. Most are clear, which allows the contents to be seen clearly, and they protect food without fear of leaching harmful chemicals. Freeze Leftovers for Future Meals It may be tempting to throw the one remaining portion of casserole in the garbage after eating it for a few meals in a row, but that's money in the trash. Freeze leftovers for later, when that same meal that seems boring now will make a tasty lunch. Related: 15 Foods That Are Always Better As Leftovers Freeze Pre-Made Meals Busy schedules often make the temptation of takeout or delivery too convenient to avoid. You can be one step ahead by making premade meals such as lasagna, chicken casserole, or rice and beans that just need a quick reheat in the oven. These convenient meals are much cheaper than prepared meals or dinner out. Related: 21 Takeout Meals Made Cheaper at Home Keep Oil in Small Jars Rather than keeping cooking oil in the large container it's sold in, keep a small bottle for each type that can be refilled. Store the larger bottles of oil in a cool, dark place away from the kitchen's heat to help extend shelf life. Store Whole Wheat Flour in the Fridge Whole wheat flour contains wheat germ, which spoils easily in warm temperatures. Keep it fresh and prevent it from going rancid by storing it in the fridge. Keep Spices Away From Sunlight and Heat Heat and sunlight damage spices, causing them to lose flavor and pick up stale flavors. If a spice rack is used, keep it away from the heat of the stove and out of natural light. Even a refrigerator is a better alternative to a hot, sunny countertop. Store Greens With Paper Towels Greens are difficult to store for longer than a few days, and once they start to go bad it can be challenging to pick out spoiled leaves from the rest. Storing greens with paper towels helps maintain a healthy level of moisture, keeping them crisp and unwithered. Store Potatoes With an Apple Apples give off a chemical that helps potatoes stay fresh and keeps them from sprouting. Store potatoes with an apple to help them stay in good condition for up to twice as long. Keep Bananas Separate The gas that bananas give off as they ripen encourages other fruit nearby to ripen more quickly. Storing bananas away from other produce will help keep them from ripening and spoiling too fast. Know Which Fruits to Refrigerate or Store on the Counter Certain fruits keep better in the fridge, while others do better at room temperature, and storing them properly reduces waste. Citrus, tomatoes, and avocados, for example, are better left unrefrigerated, but cucumbers, peppers, and carrots are better stored in the fridge. Certain foods such as apples and pears can handle either. Don't Toss That Avocado Pit Once an avocado is sliced apart it oxidizes and turns brown quickly, making it less appetizing. Keeping the pit in the piece of avocado to be saved slow the process and keeps it fresher longer. Stash the pit in a large batch of guacamole to help it stay green and fresh looking. Keep Chocolate Chilled Most chocolate has a high-fat content, which tends to spoil quickly and pick up other unwanted flavors. Keeping chocolate in the fridge properly wrapped will keep it fresh for months at a time, extending the life and preserving the flavor of this sometimes costly ingredient. Related: We Tried 15 Kinds of Chocolate and These Are the Best Store Nuts in the Freezer Nuts have a naturally high fat content and can spoil within a few days if exposed to heat and sunlight. Rancid nuts are destined for the garbage, which is a shame, especially since they can be a pricey item. Storing all kinds of nuts in the freezer allows for the purchase of larger packages at a discount and keeps them in good condition for up to a few months. Be Sure to Label Containers Properly Labeling containers is essential to staying organized and finding stored food efficiently. Arrange food storage containers so the label can be seen at a glance to avoid digging through shelves or boxes. Invest in Canning Supplies Storing homemade condiments and preserves using quality canning equipment (such as a starter set from Prepworks for $16 on Amazon ) isn't just cost-effective; it also ensures your favorite sauces, jams , pickles, and more are always on hand for meals   or last-minute gifts. Keep Celery Crisp With Aluminum Foil Soggy celery can be used to make stock and broth and doesn't need to be thrown out. But if it's for snacking, crunch matters. Keep celery stalks crisp by wrapping them in aluminum foil before stashing in the fridge. Buy a Breadbox Breadboxes have largely gone the way of rotary telephones, leaving many households to store bread in the fridge. But that's no place for bread; the cold temperature causes loaves to go stale faster. The best place to keep bread is in a cool dark place, such as a breadbox (from about $35 on Amazon , or even the microwave (when not in use, of course). Use an Ethylene Gas Absorber Products like Bluapple ( $12 for two on Amazon ) are designed to be stored in the crisper drawer to help keep fruits and veggies fresh longer. The apple-shaped device absorbs ethylene gas given off by produce, which slows the ripening process. Keep Freezer Bags Handy Having freezer bags on hand makes it easy to preserve an unexpected peck of fresh produce or leftovers from a generous meal. Nearly all foods   from soup to nuts   can be frozen easily using freezer bags, which are slightly thicker than regular plastic storage bags to help prevent freezer burn. Let the Cheese Breathe Cheese will dry out and become unappetizing if stored improperly. The best way to store cheese isn't in plastic but wrapped in parchment paper, which allows blocks or slices to breathe while preserving consistency and flavor. Related: 19 Ways to Make an Ordinary Grilled Cheese Extraordinary Reuse Food Storage Bags Food storage bags are used for so many different things, and many times they can be rinsed, dried, and reused. Stick to bags that aren't heavily soiled and haven't contained fatty foods, since the residue is difficult to wash out, or raw meat. Use Stackable Containers Rather than accumulate a hodgepodge of different shapes of storage containers, look for containers that fit together. Being able to stack containers and/or nest the inside each other when empty will maximize the space and help keep everything feeling and looking organized. Use a Vacuum Sealer A vacuum sealer (from about $40 on Amazon ) is a one-time investment that can pay for itself time and again in the long run. If you routinely buy large cuts of meat, whole animals, or other bulk proteins, a vacuum sealer helps store individual portions safely for a long time. Freeze Butter Save money by buying several packages of butter when on sale and storing extras in the freezer. Butter freezes well with no change to flavor or texture if used within a few months. Find Unused Storage Space Boost savings by maximizing overall space used for food storage. Install shelves on empty walls to create more space to stack and store staples. If the shelves are exposed, store food in attractive containers that complement the decor. Freeze Hot Dogs and Buns Store unused hot dogs and buns individually in the freezer for later, when the mood strikes. Both keep for months frozen, compared with just days in the refrigerator or pantry. Store Brown Sugar With a Marshmallow When brown sugar dries out, it turns hard and unusable and may wind up in the garbage. To maintain moisture, store bagged brown sugar with a marshmallow or two and place in a sealed container. Keep Leftover Wine in a Mini Bottle Wine goes bad when exposed to oxygen, but storing leftover wine in smaller bottles or jars with less air space can help keep oxygen from destroying the flavor and structure of the wine. While not as aesthetically pleasing, storing leftover wine in a mason jar will keep it fresh for days longer. Wrap Banana Stems in Plastic Wrap Bananas tend to ripen fast and all at once. To slow the process, wrap the banana stem in plastic wrap. To slow it down even more, break the bananas apart and wrap each individual stem. This keeps the gas the stems give off from ripening the fruit too fast. Related: 30 Cheap, Easy Breakfast Ideas to Start the Day Right Store Mushrooms in Paper Bags The best way to keep mushrooms firm and dry is in a paper bag in the fridge, a method that provides the proper balance of humidity and moisture and allows air to circulate. Stored in this way, mushrooms can last up to 10 days without getting soggy, funky, or spoiled. Set the Refrigerator at an Optimal Temperature If the fridge is too cold, it may actually freeze food, especially items in drawers or in the rear of the unit. Conversely, if it's too warm, other items will spoil faster. The ideal temperature is 35 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit, cold enough to keep foods fresh without freezing. Treat Herbs Like Fresh Flowers The best way to store fresh herbs is in a tall glass or vase with water in the bottom for the roots to soak up. Place a plastic bag over the top, unsealed, and store in the fridge. Treating them like fresh flowers with new water each day will keep them healthy and vibrant for up to 10 days. Related: Edibles Anywhere: 15 Foods to Grow in a Container Garden Heat Honey to Get Rid of Crystals Crystallized honey is safe to use, but it can be hard and unsightly and may wind up in the garbage. To avoid crystals, store honey in a cupboard, not the fridge. To get rid of crystals, warm the jar of honey in a pan of warm water. Wash Berries in Water-Vinegar Mixture Wash strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and other berries in a 10-to-1 ratio of water and vinegar to help keep them plump and fresh for up to twice as long, while also ridding them of any pests that might be lurking in the package. Freeze Leftover Canned or Jarred Sauces Many recipe call for just a small amount of tomato paste or sauce, leaving a mostly full container that will only last a few days in the fridge. Rather than watch it spoil, place it in a flat layer in a freezer bag so you can break off pieces to use in future recipes without wasting any. Store Dairy Upside Down Dense dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and sour cream create a seal just under the lid when turned upside down. The seal will prevent oxygen from getting into the container and spoiling the contents and extend product life. Infuse Oils With Leftover Herbs Fresh herbs are one of the trickiest items to store properly, and even then their shelf life is short. Storing fresh herbs in oil infuses the oil, and extends the life and flavor of the herbs well beyond the few days they would otherwise stay fresh in the fridge or on the countertop. Divide Bulk Food Into Reasonable Portions Buying bulk food can be a big money saver, although some of that savings can be squandered by improper storage. Divide bulk items into portions that maximize storage time without compromising freshness. Related: 23 Items That Are Cheaper at Whole Foods Maintain a List of Stored Food If you have a fairly extensive supply of stored food, it's a good idea to keep a list of what's on hand. You can refer to it to see if you have something in stock, rather than waste time sifting through shelves of containers. Don't Freeze Wet Produce Freezing wet produce can result in unusable food in some cases. Freezer burn can adhere to the fruits and veggies and cause unwanted flavors and a mushy texture, making the frozen food unappetizing.

He immediately cast her in his next film, "Catch Me If You Can," in a small role opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in 2002. Jennifer Garner picked up one of the most esteemed awards in acting in 2002 -- a Golden Globe. She won the prize for best actress in a TV drama the first time she was nominated for her "Alias" role. Splitsville! Jennifer Garner and Scott Foley filed for divorce in 2003 after nearly three years of marriage. She cited irreconcilable differences in their split, which a judge finalized in March 2004. She later told Allure magazine of their romance, "We didn't have a shot. He's a really good guy, and we just imploded." Though the timing looked suspicious, Jennifer Garner did not move on to Ben Affleck after splitting from husband Scott Foley. Though the stars played onscreen lovers in 2003's "Daredevil," they didn't start dating after filming this superhero flick. Jen was actually about to hit if off with a different co-star... Jennifer Garner started dating "Alias" co-star Michael Vartan in 2003. The couple's relationship lasted a year, but the two continued to work together on the ABC series for a few more years after they broke up. One golden popcorn coming right up! Jennifer Garner picked up her first MTV Movie Award in 2003 for her work in "Daredevil," taking home the breakthrough female prize -- and beating out fellow nominees like Beyonce for her work in "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" star Nia Vardalos. A family affair! When it came time to pick a date for the 2003 Primetime Emmys, Jennifer Garner looked no further than her own family -- her adorable parents, to be exact. William and Patricia Garner accompanied their daughter to the big TV award show that year. It was finally time to see Jennifer Garner as the lead in a movie when she starred in 2004's "13 Going on 30." The movie, which co-starred Judy Greer, was a huge hit that turned Jen into a full-fledged movie star. They're on! After co-starring in two films and becoming friends, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck started dating in 2004. Jen was fresh out of a relationship with Michael Vartan while Ben Affleck had recently split from Jennifer Lopez. The new couple made their first public appearance at game one of the World Series that October. Jennifer Garner picked up a Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series in 2005 for her work on "Alias." This marked her second major award for playing Sydney Bristow. She also picked up four Primetime Emmy nominations for outstanding lead actress in a drama series over the show's five seasons. Here comes the bride! Ben Affleck proposed to Jennifer Garner in April 2005 with a 4.5 carat diamond Harry Winston ring. He reportedly got down on one knee after her 33rd birthday party. They tied the knot two months later on the beach in Turks and Caicos when she was pregnant with their first child. And baby makes three! Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck welcomed their first child, daughter Violet Anne Affleck, in December 2005 (two months after they took in a baseball game in Boston, seen here). In the wake of her second marriage and new motherhood, Jennifer Garner took a year off from acting, though she still made an appearance at the 2006 Academy Awards -- just a few months after giving birth! Jennifer Garner headed back to the big screen with 2007's "Juno" and earned heaps of critical praise for her performance as an adoptive mother. Later that year, she also appeared in "The Kingdom." Broadway-bound! Jennifer Garner finished up 2007 in New York City performing on Broadway as Roxanne in "Cyrano de Bergerac." She received rave reviews, with the play continuing through 2008 (it was even recorded to air on PBS that year). Another girl! Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck welcomed their second daughter, Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck, in January 2009, making sister Violet, then 3, a proud big sister. An onscreen reunion! In 2010 Jennifer Garner and Ashton Kutcher shared the screen again 10 years after appearing together in "Dude, Where's My Car?" The stars were both involved in the ensemble romantic comedy "Valentine's Day," which was a box-office hit. Party of five! Jennifer Garner , pictured here just a month before of giving birth, added one more child to her brood with Ben Affleck in 2012. Son Samuel Garner Affleck arrived that Feb. 27. And another onscreen reunion! Jennifer Garner has a habit of re-teaming with old co-stars and this time it was Matthew McConaughey 's turn. The two, who'd previously starred in "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" in 2009, shared the screen once more in 2013's "Dallas Buyers Club." The film was a critical darling and went on to receive numerous accolades and awards. In 2013, Jennifer Garner testified before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in favor of a bill to protect stars' children from being harassed by paparazzi. Her activism in this arena led to the bill becoming a law with more parameters and stricter rules to govern photographers' behavior around children under 16. In 2009, Jennifer Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, the international non-governmental organization that promotes literacy, nutrition, early education efforts and more. Ever since, the actress -- who's also served on the organization's board -- has been a hands-on, active participant in Save the Children's initiatives. She's seen here with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the organization's first Save the Children Benefit Gala presented by Calvin Klein on Oct. 1, 2013. Jennifer Garner ventured into children's films in 2014, starring with Steve Carell in "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day." That same year, she also played a different type of parent in the poignant drama "Men, Women & Children" alongside Adam Sandler. June 2015 marked the end of Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck 's 10-year marriage. The two announced their split that month though held off on filing for divorce. Rumors of a breakup had been brewing for a while, with Ben spotted sans wedding ring and Jen spending her 43rd birthday alone. The couple issued a statement on June 30 that read: "After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private family matter. Thank you for understanding." Jennifer Garner switched gears from her usual Hollywood hits to star in a Christian family film, 2016's "Miracles from Heaven," a movie based on a true story in a bestselling book. Jen played Christy, a mom whose daughter has a near-death experience and is later healed despite having an incurable disease. She credited working on the film with inspiring her to get involved in her local Methodist church and start taking her children every Sunday. Two years after announcing their split, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck finally filed for divorce in April 2017, and by all accounts, their co-parenting relationship remained amicable. They were still spotted out often as a family, including while attending church services together. In 2017, Jennifer Garner announced the expansion of Once Upon Farm, a company she co-founded that sells organic, cold-pressed baby food in thousands of grocery stores with plans to expand further. The company took its profile even more public in 2018, the same year it secured $20 million in a second round of funding. A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame! Jennifer Garner earned this esteemed honor in August 2018. She attended the ceremony with her whole family including her kids, her parents and her sisters. Back to her action-hero roots! It had been a while since Jennifer Garner had sprung into action onscreen, but she returned with a vengeance in 2018's "Peppermint." The film opened just days after Jen made headlines for staging an intervention for estranged husband Ben Affleck that got him to return to rehab to seek treatment for alcohol addiction. Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck finally settled their divorce with a private judge in early October 2018, which paved the way for their marriage to be legally dissolved just weeks later. Jen's seen here in her usual daily working-mom uniform as she ran errands in Los Angeles the same week. Jennifer Garner also returned to the small screen in October 2018. She starred as wife, mother and minor Instagram celebrity Kathryn McSorley-Jodel on the HBO limited series "Camping." Jen is pictured here at the show's premiere in Los Angeles. Around the same time her divorce from Ben Affleck was finalized, reports revealed that Jennifer Garner had a new man in her life -- Cali Group CEO John Miller, a Stanford Law alum whose company owns Miso Robotics and 50 CaliBurger restaurants. The pair, who had reportedly been dating for six months when news of their romance was made public, made a point to keep a very low profile after their secret was out. Jennifer Garner received a huge honor in the spring of 2019 when she scored the cover of People magazine's 2019 Beautiful issue . Though she's obviously a stunning woman, she told People that the most beautiful thing in her life is being a mom. "I'm starting to get to the point where I realize this job is not going to be forever," she said of raising her three children with ex Ben Affleck . "Not in the all-encompassing every meal, every moment, every day way that I have loved for the last 13 years. It's going to shift. But there's beauty in how it works in episodes."

Whittle your middle, improve your health, and gain confidence with these science-backed tips. 50 Easy Ways You Can Shrink Your Belly Sick of seeing your belly folding over your waistband? It's time to get rid of it for good and shrink your belly and it's not as hard as you may think. To boost your confidence, improve your health , and slim down your midsection, we've compiled easy tips for how you can shrink your belly and lose your gut for good. Though it can be difficult to target fat in one specific area of your body, certain habits, foods, and exercises have been shown to help people shrink their waistlines, reduce visceral belly fat, flatten their stomachs, debloat, and tone their abs. For waist-shrinking tips backed by research and noted experts, keep reading. To zap even more fat, pair these tips with these 50 Foods To Lose Your Gut . 1. Be Mindful Losing your gut isn't just about what you put in your body; it's about what's going on in your brain, too. In a 2015 study, Brown University researchers asked nearly 400 people to complete a mindfulness awareness survey, which asked whether subjects agreed with such questions as "I find it difficult to stay focused on what's happening in the present." Then, they X-rayed the subjects' bellies to determine their degree of belly fat. The results showed that the higher people scored on the mindfulness survey, the less visceral fat they were likely to have. People who are less mindful have, on average, an extra pound of fat inside their bellies than those who are more in tune with their everyday lives and the world around them. Eating mindfully also happens to be one of the top Weight Loss Tips From Real People . 2. Make Fewer Decisions Believe it or not, the fewer decisions you make in a day, the better it is for your gut. A study published in Social Science and Medicine found those who have high levels of what's called "skill discretion" i.e., they exercise control by getting things done themselves tended to have lower BMIs. In contrast, those who are constantly deciding on courses of action for others may eventually come down with "decision fatigue" and make ill-informed choices, such as ordering that piece of cheesecake for dessert. That's why we recommend rotating just a few go-to recipes during the week. Get inspired by these 20 Quick & Easy Breakfast Recipes so you can pick a few and stick with them. 3. Don't Be Afraid To Instagram Your Meals Your friends and family may roll their eyes when you whip out your phone to Instagram your meals, but what they see as an annoying habit might actually be improving your health. An analysis of "attentive eating" studies in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found those who recall their last meal as being filling and satisfying tended to eat less at their next meal, thus keeping their guts smaller. So if you have trouble remembering what you had for dinner last night, try Instagramming your meals in an effort to feel content the next time you sit down to break bread. Here are 20 Quick & Easy Dinner Recipes if you need some meal inspiration. 4. Fantasize About Overeating Sugary Treats You're right to think this one sounds counterintuitive, but allow us to explain. In one 2010 study , researchers broke participants into two groups and asked one group to fantasize about eating three M&M'S. The other group was instructed to imagine themselves eating thirty of the sweet morsels, and when scientists invited all of the participants to enjoy some real M&M'S as part of a "taste test," those who fantasized about eating thirty candies actually tended to eat less of the real thing than those who kept their imaginations limited to just three. In other words, researchers found that, contrary to popular belief, imagining the pleasure of gorging on a food actually reduces your appetite for it. Now excuse us while we go dream of cake! 5. Use Smaller Bowls Though this may sound obvious if you want to lose weight and get rid of your gut for good, use smaller plates and bowls. The FASEB Journal suggests overeating may be associated with the size of our dinnerware, because in one study participants who were given larger bowls served and ate 16 percent more than those given smaller bowls. What's more? The big-bowlers underestimated just how much they were eating by 7 percent! 6. Get A Good Night's Sleep Getting a good night's sleep has various health benefits for your entire body, and the gut is no exception. According to Wake Forest researchers , dieters who sleep five hours or less put on two and a half times more belly fat, while those who sleep more than eight hours pack on slightly less than that. Though that might not sound like much, when you have a regular bedtime and stick to it, you set yourself up for day-in, day-out weight loss. "Proper sleep is crucial for weight loss. Too little sleep leads to poor food choices, largely due to increased levels of the hunger hormone, ghrelin. Too little sleep also decreases levels of leptin, a hormone that helps satiate your appetite. Lack of sleep also clouds judgment and causes impulse decision making, which inevitably leads to poor food choices," adds founder and Certified Sleep Science Coach at SleepZoo , Chris Brantner. To get a better night's sleep, avoid these 17 Foods That Sabotage Your Sleep . 7. Pick A Set Number Of Foods, And Stick To Them As it turns out, there's something to be said for being a creature of habit and eating the same foods day in and day out, especially if you're on a mission to lose your gut. When researchers looked at the diets of 6,814 people, they found that the more diverse one's diet, the more likely one was to experience weight gain. In fact, those who ate the widest range of foods showed a 120 percent greater increase in waist circumference compared with those who had the least diversity. To help streamline your foods, meal prepping can be key. You'll want to see the 20 Best Foods to Meal Prep on Sunday to Eat Healthy All Week . 8. Put Your Fork Down Between Bites It takes twenty minutes for your stomach to tell your brain that it's had enough, so if you eat slowly chances are you will consume less and see your belly shrink. A study in BMJ Open found that slow and normal-speed eaters were less likely to be obese than fast eaters! A simple trick to slow your pace: Place your fork down on the plate after each bite. 9. Snack Smart Munching on the right snacks throughout the day is one of the best ways to shrink your waistline. Need proof? According to a recent study, researchers found participants lost significantly more body weight when they incorporated low-sugar, high-protein snacks into their daily food routine. Fitting in healthy, high protein snacks (such as a handful of unsalted almonds) helps to maintain blood-sugar levels which keeps your brain from triggering hunger pangs and stops your body from indulging in unhealthy foods after what feels like a long day of starvation. And for some snack ideas, see The 50 Best Healthy Snacks to Buy for Weight Loss . 10. Avoid Stress When you're continually stressed out, it's bad news for your gut. Stress triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol, and because cortisol is evolutionarily linked to alerting your body to external dangers (like that buffalo headed straight for you) and low blood-glucose levels, it forces your body to store fat and makes you feel hungry. In other words, if you're stressed, you'll start craving that afternoon candy bar even if your stomach is actually full. To avoid stress, try simple things like taking deep breaths and meditating for a few minutes each day. Stress doesn't just make you gain weight, either. Find out the 30 Things Stress Is Doing to Your Body . 11. Drink Water Prior To Each Meal According to a study, sipping 16 ounces of water before each meal can lead to substantial weight loss. Researchers enlisted 84 obese adults for a three-month experiment and broke the participants into two groups. The first group was told to drink 16 ounces of water half an hour before each of their meals while. the other group was told to imagine that they were already full prior to digging in. When the study concluded, the water group lost about 9 pounds, while their imaginative peers shed approximately three fewer pounds. According to the researchers, loading up on H2O before meals is an effective weight loss strategy because it helps increase satiety. If you're less hungry when mealtime rolls around, then you're more inclined to make smarter food choices. 12. Buy A BPA-Free Water Bottle Since we've already established that H2O can help ward off misunderstood hunger pangs, it's not a bad idea to carry a water bottle around with you everywhere just make sure it isn't plastic. Some plastic bottles are made with Bisphenol A (BPA), a harmful chemical that can negatively impact fertility in men and women and has been linked to obesity: A 2017 study found that adults with the highest concentration of BPA in their urine had significantly larger waists and odds of being obese than those in the lowest quartile. 13. Get Some Sun With your BPA-free water bottle in hand, head out on an early morning stroll to shrink your waist. A study published in Scientific Reports found that exposure to sunlight between the hours of 8 a.m. and noon reduced your risk of weight gain regardless of activity level, caloric intake, or age. Though the exact reason why is unclear, researchers believe the morning light synchronizes your metabolism and undercuts your fat genes. What's more? Burning calories before you eat means you're exercising in a fasted state the energy you burn comes from your fat stores, not from the food you ate. 14. Replace Simple Carbs With High-Fiber Foods One of the easiest things you can do to get rid of your gut is to replace simple carbs with high fiber foods, which include whole grains, wheat bran, berries, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. " High fiber foods are great for reducing midsection weight or belly bloat," says Amanda Baker Lemein , MS, RD, LDN. "Fiber helps draw in water, keeping us feeling fuller for longer, and also stimulates movement in the colon to help keep us regular. Including more high fiber foods in the diet is not only important for weight loss but also may help with the prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers." If you need some ideas, see 25 Best Store-Bought High-Protein Snacks . 15. Cut Your Sugar Intake And Increase The Amount Of Fiber You Eat As you may have guessed based on the tip above, cutting sugar helps to trim your tummy. In a review of 68 clinical trials and studies, New Zealand researchers reported in the British Medical Journal that increasing sugar intake meant increasing body weight while reducing sugar meant reducing body weight. Similarly, increasing fiber is another way to lose your gut. In a study of 1,114 people over five years, researchers reported that for every 10 grams of soluble fiber people ate, their belly fat accumulation was reduced by nearly 4 percent even if they did nothing else to lose weight. Want to make sure you're eating more soluble fiber? Check out 20 Easy Ways to Add Fiber to Your Diet . 16. Stay Away From Fructose Speaking of sugar, the type of sweet stuff you ingest can have a negative impact on the size of your gut. In one study, Princeton University researchers Princeton University researchers fed subjects beverages sweetened with either glucose or fructose. Though both groups gained the same amount of weight over a two-month period, the fructose group gained its weight primarily as belly fat because of the way this type of sugar is processed in the liver. In other words, if you want to lose your gut, stay away from fructose, including high-fructose corn syrup and these 105 Most Popular Sodas Ranked by How Toxic They Are ! 17. And Avoid Artificial Sweeteners Simply put, artificial sweeteners cause belly fat. A 2015 study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that increasing diet soda intake is directly linked to greater abdominal obesity. In the study of older adults, researchers found those who drank diet soda each day experienced more than triple the increase in waist size over the course of nine years, so put down the Diet Coke and don't even think about reaching for some Equal to put in your morning coffee. RELATED : The easy guide to cutting back on sugar is finally here. 18. Know The Flat Belly Fats Though eating fats seems like a counterintuitive way to shrink your stomach, flat belly fats such as olive, canola, avocado, and walnut oils, plant-fat rich foods like avocados and olives, and nut and seed butters like peanut butter, almond butter, and tahini, can help you get the job done. However, as with any packaged food, make sure you're looking for one with less sugar than fiber. 19. Make Room For Tyrosine It's quite possible you've never heard of the amino acid tyrosine a building block of protein but it's an important one to know if you want to get rid of a bulging belly. Tyrosine has been shown to prevent belly-bloating sugar cravings by encouraging the brain to release dopamine and another neurotransmitter, norepinephrine. In other words, eating more tyrosine (which can be found in eggs, spirulina, certain cheeses such as Parmesan, Gruyère, Swiss, and Romano, milk, sesame seeds, beef, and bacon) helps fend off those harmful sugar cravings that make your belly fat. 20. Choose The Right Booze As tempting as a frozen margarita might be once happy hour rolls around, it's most likely filled with viscous syrups made predominantly of high-fructose corn syrup (remember that belly baddie?) and thus high in calories. To keep your belly in shape, ditch the marg and instead choose a cocktail made with club soda and lime, or stick with nutrient-packed red wine which has about 125 calories per glass. For the best picks, see The Healthiest Red Wines and Which Ones to Buy . 21. Stay Away From Sugar-Free Stuff In a 2012 study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , researchers found that those who drank diet beverages had higher fasting glucose, thicker waists, lower HDL (good) cholesterol, higher triglycerides, and higher blood pressure. In other words, sugar-free cookies, soda, and the like may seem like a healthier option, but they contribute to a bulging belly and negatively impact your health in multiple ways. 22. Steer Clear Of Refined Grains Speaking of avoidance, another food group to keep away from is refined grains, such as crackers, chips, pretzels or 'white' carbohydrates like white breads or white rice. "Not only do these foods lack any fiber, but they also provide no satiety, and therefore make it easy to overeat them, leading to excess weight," explains Lemein. Count these among the 21 Foods to Toss Out of Your Kitchen For Good . 23. Make A High-Fiber, High-Protein Breakfast There's some truth to the old adage that breakfast is the "most important meal of the day," and if you're looking to blast belly fat, what you eat at the start of each day can make all the difference. According to a study from the University of Missouri in Columbia , a high-fiber, high-protein breakfast may be the most important investment you can make in your waistline, because the study showed that eating breakfast triggered women's brains to release dopamine, a feel-good chemical that helps to control impulses. In other words, eating a balanced breakfast decreases your chances of reaching for that 3 p.m. candy bar, and keeps your belly slim. Read more: 18 High Protein Breakfasts That Keep You Full 24. Go Gaga For Grapefruit A study in the journal Metabolism found that eating half a grapefruit before meals may help reduce visceral fat and lower cholesterol levels. Participants in the six-week study who ate a Rio Red grapefruit fifteen minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner saw their waists shrink by up to an inch, and LDL levels drop by 18 points. Though the weight loss magic of grapefruits is not entirely understood, researchers attribute the effects to a combination of phytochemicals and vitamin C in the tart treat. To reap grapefruit's benefits, consider having half of one before your morning oatmeal, slicing a few segments over a salad, or eating one for a snack shortly before a meal. 25. Try Meatless Monday Meatless Monday is more than just an alliteration; it's an easy way to lose your gut. Numerous studies have shown that those who eat the least amount of meat are less likely to be obese, have lower BMIs, and the lowest body fat levels. Though it's perfectly fine to eat meat a few times a week, these high-protein foods tend to fill you up before you can work your way over to the veggies, which are known to possess fat-fighting, waist-trimming powers. For some inspiration on what to make, see 20 Protein-Packed Vegetarian Meals . 26. Remember to Eat Non-Starchy Veggies Speaking of veggies, those with little starch such as broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes can help combat fat. In fact, one Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study found that consuming more non-starchy veggies resulted in an impressive 17 percent decrease in visceral fat in overweight kids. Although you may be all grown up, it's safe to assume adding more veggies can help adults trim their belly fat, too. You'll also want to see the 12 Surprising Vegetables That Become Healthier When They're Cooked . 27. Eat Veggies Packed With Vitamin C In addition to being low in starch, bell peppers are also rich in vitamin C. The important nutrient has been shown to counteract stress hormones which trigger fat storage around the midsection. In other words, bell peppers act as a double belly-shrinking whammy! Veggies that pack a similar punch include zucchini, Brussels sprouts, and kale. Other veggies that help you torch fat include these 40 Best-Ever Fat-Burning Foods . 28. Go Green Like many other veggies, greens can also help you stay slim and keep your belly flat. "For clients that are looking to target their belly, I always recommending eating greens 2-3 times per day," advises Lisa Hayim, MS, RD, founder of The Well Necessities and registered dietitian consultant for Emmy's Organics . "When we make dietary choices, we usually load up on protein and complex carbohydrates like bread and rice. While these foods can be nutrient-dense, we miss out on major micronutrients that nourish us, fill us up, and happen to be calorically less dense. Thinking about ways to add greens to each meal is an excellent way to debloat and amp up your nutrients and fiber." Having a hard time adding more greens to your diet? These Are the 10 Best Greens Powders You Can Buy, According to Nutritionists . 29. Pass The Guacamole Though avocados get a bad rap for being high in calories, they're actually loaded with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats that make you feel less hungry. Need proof? A study in Nutrition Journal found that participants who ate half a fresh avocado with lunch reported a 40 percent decreased desire to eat for hours afterward. What's more? Unsaturated fats, such as those found in avocados seem, to prevent the storage of belly fat. In other words, those green goddesses can help you lose your gut in two different ways. You'll want to see the 8 Avocado Health Benefits That Prove It's a Perfect Weight Loss Food if you want to learn just how healthy they are! 30. Indulge In Some Dark Chocolate Reaching for the dark chocolate in an effort to slim your waist may sound ridiculous, but there's evidence to suggest that nibbling on the decadent treat has its perks. In fact, one study found that antioxidants in cocoa prevented laboratory mice from gaining excess weight and actually lowered their blood sugar levels. Another study at Louisiana State University found that gut microbes in our stomach ferment chocolate into heart-healthy, anti-inflammatory compounds that shut down genes linked to insulin resistance and inflammation. When paired with berries, the dark chocolate becomes even more effective because the fruit speeds up the fermentation process, leading to an even greater reduction in inflammation and weight. Want to find the best dark chocolate for you? Check out The 17 Best and Worst Dark Chocolates . 31. Ready Some Raspberries Speaking of berries, they also have qualities of their own that can help you shrink your belly. Raspberries, for example, pack more fiber and liquid than most other fruits, which boosts satiety. They're a rich source of ketones, antioxidants that can make you slimmer by incinerating stored fat cells. Lastly, like other berries, raspberries are loaded with polyphenols, powerful natural chemicals that have been shown to decrease the formation of fat cells and eliminate abdominal fat. 32. Eat More Blueberries Not to be outdone, research suggests blueberries can also help blast away stubborn belly fat by engaging your get-lean genes. After a 90-day trial, University of Michigan researchers discovered rats that were fed a blueberry-enriched diet showed significantly reduced belly fat than the control group. 33. Get Some Genistein Like avocados, peanuts are also high in calories, but they have a hidden weapon in their weight-loss utility belt: Genistein. The compound, which can also be found in fava beans and soybeans, acts directly on the genes for obesity by turning them down and reducing your body's ability to store fat. Besides helping you lose your gut, did you know the 24 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Eat Peanut Butter ? 34. Make A Cup Of White Tea There are several different teas that can stimulate weight loss and help you burn belly fat, but because white tea works with your body in multiple ways to promote fat-burning, it's really in a league of its own. According to a study published in the journal Nutrition and Metabolism white tea stops the formation of new fat cells while simultaneously boosting lipolysis, the body's process of breaking down stored fat. Brew this and watch your gut shrink! 35. Eat Eggs Want to flatten your tummy? Start your day by eating eggs. In one study with 21 participants, half were fed a breakfast of bagels while half ate eggs. The egg group had a lower response to ghrelin (the "hunger hormone,") were less hungry three hours later, and consumed fewer calories over the course of the next day than the bagel eaters. What's more? Egg yolks contain choline, a nutrient with powerful fat-burning properties. Read more: 17 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Eat Eggs 36. Go Nuts For Nuts Omega-3 fatty acids make salmon and some other fish nutritional stars partially because they play a key role in reducing belly fat storage while keeping us full and satisfied, but if fish isn't your thing then reach for a handful of nuts instead. Just 1/4 cup of walnuts contains more than two day's worth of ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), a type of omega 3. Walnuts have also been shown to reduce blood pressure and decrease inflammation in the blood vessels when you're stressed, which in and of itself can help you keep your belly flat. 37. Go Bananas For Bananas Bloated belly? Snack on a banana. The tropical yellow fruits are packed with potassium, which helps regulate fluid balance to flatten belly bloat. Other potassium-rich foods include sweet potatoes , watermelon, and beets. Read more: 17 Amazing Ways to Eat a Banana 38. Embrace Acidic Foods According to several studies, acidic foods help increase the rate at which the body burns off carbs by up to 40 percent. The faster you burn off carbs, the sooner your body starts incinerating fat, which can help you get a flat tummy and overall lean look. Translation: Grab a pickle jar and start snacking if you want to lose your gut for good! 39. Learn To Love Whole Grains While there's no doubt many fruits and veggies can help you lose that bulge in your midsection, certain grains can lend a hand, too. A Tufts University study found that participants who ate three or more servings of whole grains per day had 10 percent less belly fat than people who ate the same amount of calories from refined carbs. In other words, swap out white bread, rice, and pasta in favor of oats, quinoa, brown rice, or wheat. 40. Go Cuckoo For Coconut Oil A study of 20 men in the journal ISRN Pharmacology found that just 2 tablespoons per day reduced waist circumference by an average of 1.1 inches over the course of a month. Not too shabby. Coconut oil is a waist shrinker thanks, in part, to its medium chain triglycerides. Unlike the long-chain fatty acids found in animal sources of saturated fat, coconut oil doesn't really raise your cholesterol and is more likely to be burned as energy than stored as fat. 40 Nutrition Experts Told Us The Foods You Should Be Eating Every Day , and coconut oil is one of them! 41. Support Healthy Belly Bacteria There are healthy belly bacteria, and then there are bad belly bacteria, the later of which studies indicate overweight people have more of in their gut. To keep the fat-causing bugs at bay, you need to eat a variety of foods that support their healthy counterparts the kind found in the bellies of slim people. Examples of probiotic-rich foods that help you lose weight by aiding digestion include kefir, kombucha, and bone broth. Read up on our list of 14 Best Probiotic Foods for a Healthy Gut . 42. Sprinkle Some Cilantro On Your Meal Another bloat-busting food to have on hand is cilantro. The herb, though polarizing in terms of taste, contains a unique blend of oils that work much like over-the-counter meds to relax digestive muscles and alleviate an "overactive" gut. A study published in the journal Digestive Diseases and Science found that patients with IBS benefited from supplementing with cilantro as opposed to a placebo because their bellies weren't as bloated. 43. Beware Of Trans Fats One final thing to avoid when buying, cooking, or ordering food is trans fats . These man-made fats are typically found in processed foods such as boxed cake mixes. They're a "Not That!" because, as noted in the journal Obesity , they've been found to pack on the belly fat in monkeys. As it turns out, they're not great for humans either. "Trans fats cause inflammation in the body leading to insulin resistance and impairing the body's ability to use glucose properly, resulting in excess fat storage around the belly," says Tina Marinaccio , MS, RD, CPT. Trans fats, which are created by partially hydrogenating vegetable oils, are beloved by manufacturers because they increase the shelf life of processed foods, but they are no friend to your waistline. "Trans fats may be lurking in any processed or fried food such as chips, baked goods, and even butter spreads," Tina warns. "To avoid them, check the ingredients for hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils." Need more reasons why you should ditch the processed foods? Here are 21 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Stop Eating Processed Food . 44. Exercise Before You Eat While there's no need to hit a high-intensity spin class before you nosh, scientists in New Zealand recently found that men and women who engaged in three 10-minute exercise "hors d'oeuvres" before each meal saw lowered blood glucose levels a fat-busting benefit these folks displayed all day long! If that task sounds too daunting, then start out by taking a walk around the office before lunch and build from there. 45. Try Strength Training Strength training is a great way to stay in shape and build up muscle, and because muscle mass burns more calories than fat (not a lot, but every little bit counts!), the more muscle on your skeleton, the quicker you will lose the fat throughout your body, especially around your abdomen. A simple way to build up muscle via strength training is to do push-ups or planks. Supplement your muscle-building progress with these 10 Best Protein Powders For Weight Loss In 2019, According To RDs . 46. Or Some Varied Cardio If a cardio workout is more your speed, consider going for a walk or run, but remember to vary your speeds. "Why?" you ask. Research has shown it will help you learn how to lose your gut. In a Danish study reported by the American Diabetes Association, two groups of people with type 2 diabetes were put on a walking program. One group walked at a steady speed, while the other group varied their walking speed. After four months, the interval-training group lost eight more pounds than the steady walkers. Even better, the walkers who changed up their speeds lost visceral belly fat and improved their blood sugar control. 47. Give High-Intensity Interval Training A Shot High-intensity interval training (or HIIT) is a great belly-blasting option for those who already feel comfortable in the gym because it helps you drop fatty tissue and build muscle simultaneously. "High-intensity interval training is when you perform an exercise at or close to your maximum ability for a short period of time and then take a brief respite and do it again. HIIT should usually be done on a 2:1 interval, meaning if you did an exercise for one minute, you rest for 30 seconds and then repeat," explains Dr. Alex Tauberg , DC, CSCS, EMR. To use HIIT to shrink your belly, do workouts that engage your core such as abdominal crunches or bridges. "By performing core workouts using a HIIT plan, you can burn calories and build muscle at the same time," Alex adds. "This can be a great way to flatten that stomach when you don't have too much time to work out." 48. Hop On A Trampoline Sure, trampolines are built for kids, but as an adult using one for rebounding is a great way to flatten your tummy. "Not only is it a great cardio workout (which is the first step to tightening up your midsection) but it makes your core work like crazy so you are getting the cardio plus the toning," explains Hope Pedraza , a Certified Personal Trainer through American College of Sports Medicine "Everything you need for a tight tummy!" To get a comprehensive workout using a mini trampoline, Hope suggests jumping, lifting your knees up high, twisting, adding some light weights to move around while you're jumping, and moving in all directions in different planes. 49. Dance, Dance, Dance In the words of Lady Gaga, "Just Dance!" Explains Hope, "Dance cardio really is an amazing way to trim belly fat because it is going to help shed fat on the body as a whole. It is obviously a cardio workout, but because your body is forced to move in all different directions in different planes, it is making every single muscle in your body work. Similar to the benefits of a HIIT workout, you get the cardio plus toning benefit all in one," she explains, noting that she teaches a dance cardio class at inBalance, the fitness and wellness studio she founded in San Antonio. "In the case of our dance cardio class, it is set up in an interval style workout because bringing your heart rate up and down multiples times amps up the challenge on your metabolism, getting you into fat burning mode even after you're done working out." Bye-bye belly fat! 50. Shed Weight Quickly Despite the common perception that you need to drop pounds slowly in order to maintain your weight loss, the exact opposite is true. In fact, you're more than five times as likely to succeed in your long-term weight-loss goals if you start out of the gate by dropping pounds rapidly, according to a 2013 study in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine . To focus on rapid weight loss in your midsection, do any of the exercises mentioned above, and eat more fiber and less sugar.

BBKrukC	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	The Surefire Way to Test Whether Baking Powder Is Still Good		You know that can of baking powder whiling away in your pantry? It says hi! It's reliable and multipurpose and helps out with a teaspoon here, a tablespoon there. But, really, how long do you think you've had it? The leavening agent may have a long shelf life, but it's definitely not immortal. Related video: Here's an Easy Test to Find Out If Your Baking Powder Is Still Good (provided by the Rachael Ray Show) If you, like me, are a lackadaisical baker, you can probably stretch a can of baking powder anywhere from a year to...three (I've moved the same can across three different apartments). As expected, baking powder does go bad. Or rather, it loses its luster. The chemical compound often a combination of baking soda, cream of tartar, and cornstarch is only supposed to last somewhere from six months to a year. It's sensitive to moisture, so any unexpected humidity could ruin your can. But don't go running to the trash bin just yet! Can You Substitute Baking Soda for Baking Powder? (And Vice Versa?) by Emma Laperruque Instead, try this test. It's uber easy you need only water and will put to bed any fears that your baking powder has got to go. Also, it will keep you from whipping together muffins that refuse to rise. So what is it, you ask? Like I said, it's simple. To check whether baking powder is still active, spoon a bit into a bowl (1/2 teaspoon will do) and pour in boiling water (1/4 cup will do). If the mixture bubbles, your powder's good to go! If it doesn't, your powder's good to go...in the trash. It won't give your baked goods the rise they so desire. Opt instead for a new tin. Keep it stored with a tight lid in a cool, dry place, like a pantry. So there you have it: the baking soda test that will save you from yourself. Or at least from soggy cakes.

AAARwH5	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	6 Tips to Make Perfect Scrambled Eggs	For one, you don't need a whisk.	For a long time, I liked the idea of scrambled eggs much more than I liked actual scrambled eggs. My dad would make them for me often as a kid, but they were always rubbery and dry (sorry, Dad) far from my light, fluffy, and creamy expectations. When I started to make my own scrambled eggs, I realized what my dad had been doing wrong: He'd been cooking the eggs for way too long over a heat that was definitely way too high. When it comes to making the perfect scrambled eggs, it's not about which ingredients you do or don't use what's really going to determine how they turn out is how long you cook them and the level of heat that you use. If you know how to balance these elements, you can use the same exact ingredients to make whatever style of scrambled eggs you prefer, whether that's fluffy and firm or soft and creamy. There are a few other tips that come in handy, too, like using the right pan and knowing when you should season the eggs or exactly how much cooking oil or butter you should use. Here, Nick Korbee, executive chef of Egg Shop in New York City and author of the Egg Shop Cookbook , explains everything you need to know to make perfect scrambled eggs, no matter how you prefer them. 1. Gather your ingredients and tools. For any scrambled egg recipe, Korbee says that all you'll really need are eggs and a fat source to cook them in, which can be olive oil, butter, ghee, or whatever you like. He says you should use a tablespoon of fat for every two eggs you cook. There are a lot of strong opinions out there about whether or not you should add milk to scrambled eggs. I personally like adding a splash of milk or cream directly to my eggs before I start cooking. I find that it makes them more tender plus, it's a great way to add more volume to your scrambled eggs if you're maybe running low and need to feed a few. But this is really up to personal preference. You don't need milk to make scrambled eggs creamy, as long as you follow the cooking instructions in step 3 below. As for tools, Korbee says you'll need a bowl, fork, rubber spatula or wooden spoon, and a non-stick skillet. 2. Scramble the raw eggs with a fork. Once you have everything together, crack your eggs into a bowl and use a fork to whisk them together. Combine them so that the whites and yolks are fully mixed (to avoid streaky eggs). Korbee suggesting scrambling with a fork instead of a whisk because a whisk tends to incorporate more air which could make the eggs too foamy and bubbly and the overall texture too airy. That being said, if airy is your preferred scrambled egg texture, use a whisk and go to town. 3. For soft and creamy eggs, cook them low and slow. "A 'French-style' soft scramble entails stirring and folding eggs with butter over the gentlest heat until the eggs are cooked but still entirely pourable," Korbee explains. That gentle heat and consistent stirring produces eggs that are so soft and creamy, you have to eat them out of a bowl and with a spoon. Personally, this is my all-time favorite way to enjoy scrambled eggs I love them plain or topped with anything from pesto to kimchi. If you want to make them this way, set a small pot over low heat. Add the butter (or another fat source, if you prefer) and then pour in the eggs, scraping any bits that get stuck to the bottom as you go. After a couple of minutes, the eggs will start to look soupy, and then will fully come together in another minute or two. You'll know your scrambled eggs are ready to go when they have a texture similar to that of cottage cheese. Speaking of cheese: If you want to add cheese to your scrambled eggs, stir it in when the eggs are about halfway done. That'll give it time to melt and incorporate fully. 4. For firm and fluffy eggs, go for higher and quicker. If you'd prefer scrambled eggs that are firm enough to eat with a fork, you'll need to cook them quickly over a medium-high heat. Make sure your pan is hot before you even get started, says Korbee. "If you can hold your hand an inch from the cooking surface comfortably for 30 seconds, it's not hot enough," he explains. Once the pan is ready to go, add your fat source and let it melt. Then, add your pre-whipped eggs and let them cook until the edges lightly set, about a minute or so. Once they do, begin folding the eggs on top of themselves, making sure to scrape any that gets stuck to the bottom as you go. You don't want to break up the eggs, because smaller pieces are more likely to overcook. Instead, gently fold and push them so that the eggs stay together but still take on a delicious scrambled texture. Again, add any cheese about halfway through. 5. Remove eggs from the heat as soon as possible. Once your eggs are just about set, take them off the heat. The residual heat in the pan will keep cooking them a bit, so if you take them off while they seem slightly underdone, they'll be perfect by the time you're ready to eat. (Unless, of course, you like your scrambled eggs well done.) 6. Season and add your favorite toppings. Wait until the very end to add any salt to your scrambled eggs. Salt draws out moisture, so if you add it too soon or in the very beginning, it may dry out your eggs. Save any other spices or ingredients that you want to add until the very end, but then feel free to get as experimental as you like. The nice thing about scrambled eggs is that they're a delicious blank canvas, and they taste great topped with so many different things. If you don't want to eat them plain, try finishing them off with a handful of cheese, a sprinkle of pepper, or a even a dash of hot sauce. The possibilities for a fresh plate of perfect scrambled eggs are pretty much endless. Related video: 50 People Try to Make Scrambled Eggs

From Hawaii's Na Pali Coast to the Verdon Gorge in southeastern France, there are incredible places all over the planet. Keep reading to learn about 30 of the most beautiful natural wonders on Earth. The Dead Sea, Israel and Jordan Sitting at 1,410 feet below sea level, the Dead Sea is the lowest body of water on Earth's surface . Located in a desert and featuring a high concentration of salt, it's the perfect spot for floating. The water is beautiful enough on its own, but the deposits and columns of salt that rise out of the water give it a unique, otherworldly look. Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia When lakes near these Bolivian salt flats overflow, they create a majestic mirrored surface that reflects the sky and clouds above. The Salar de Uyuni are the largest of their kind and cover a whopping 4,050 square miles of the Bolivian Altiplano. The vast oasis of salt boasts a horizon that never seems to end, making this spot a photographer's dream. Zhangye Danxia Landform Geological Park, Gansu, China Danxia refers to a special type of landscape found in southwestern China. The colorful, striped mountains are made up of layers of minerals and rock, which were disrupted when tectonic plates caused the island that is now India to collide with the rest of the Eurasia continent. Now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site , the once little-known wonder is a popular tourist draw - and for good reason. Chances are you've never seen anything like it before. Geiranger Fjord, Møre og Romsdal County, Norway A fjord is best described as an underwater valley . Formed by glaciers, these long and narrow waterways are deep and surrounded by steep mountains on all sides. The Geiranger Fjord is one of Norway's most famous, and is also a UNESCO World Heritage site. Go in the warmer months to see lush greenery offset by deep blue waters. Tegalalang Rice Terrace, Tegalalang and Ubud, Indonesia Indonesia is known for its terraced rice fields - and Tegalalang is one of the most well-known. Entering the vibrant green landscape with its towering palm trees will make you feel like time has stopped. And there's some truth to that feeling. Farmers here use an irrigation system that's been passed down for centuries. Reynisfjara Beach, Vik, Iceland You probably won't want to sunbathe on Reynisfjara, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a visit. The stunning beach looks otherworldly thanks to its black sand, basalt stone columns, and the fog that sometimes envelops it. If you're lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. The Cliffs of Moher, County Clare, Ireland One of Ireland's most-visited natural attractions, the Cliffs of Moher stretch along the country's west coast for five majestic miles. The rugged cliffs offerunparalleled views of the ocean below. The Grand Canyon, Arizona, United States The Grand Canyon is Arizona's most well-known natural beauty, and for good reason: between its immense size and breathtaking views, this natural phenomenon is a must-see. The canyon stretches on for 277 river miles and spans 18 miles from side to side . While the South Rim is open all year round , the North Rim is open to visitors on a more seasonal basis. Monteverde Cloud Forest, Monte Verde, Costa Rica Because it's a rainforest, the weather might not always be ideal at Monteverde, but the fact is it'll feel and look like a jungle paradise no matter if it's misty or not. Even better, this biological reserve is known to be home to a multitude of species. In fact, it's one of only a few places around the world that boasts all six species of the cat family. Ha Long Bay, Vietnam Ha Long Bay's natural beauty makes it one of Vietnam's number one tourist sites . The bay is also a UNESCO World Heritage site . The best way to see Ha Long's awe-inspiring limestone towers is by boat. In fact, many tourists stay overnight on a boat in the bay. Na Pali Coast, Hawaii, United States Between the colorful cliffs and the azure blue waters below, Hawaii's Na Pali Coast is sure to wow any visitor. Hiking the cliffs will afford you 4,000-foot-high views of the Pacific Ocean and Kalalau Valley, as well as plenty of beautiful waterfalls along the way. Skógafoss, Skógar, Iceland Skógafoss flows from not one, but two glaciers (Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull). According to legend, a viking named Thrasi hid his chest of gold under this stunning waterfall. Gold or not, the heavy amount of spray that the waterfall produces makes a sunny-day rainbow sighting here very likely. White Sands National Monument, New Mexico The largest gypsum deposit in the world, White Sands National Monument is a serene expanse of glittering, white sand that's located in the Chihuahuan Desert. The gypsum that forms these gently sloping dunes comes from a nearby ephemeral lake that has a high mineral content . As the water from this lake evaporates, minerals remain, which then form gypsum deposits that are carried by the wind. Bioluminescent Beaches, Maldives To experience the Maldives' magical glowing beaches, you can visit any of the 1,190 islands that comprise the South Asian sovereign state. Some of the top spots to see this natural light show - the result of bioluminescent plankton - include Athuruga, Reethi, and Mirihi . Marble Caves, Chile Located in Patagonia on Lake General Carrera, Chile's Marble Caves (also known as the "Marble Cathedral") were created more than 6,000 years ago by waves that eroded the rocks. The caverns' stunning colors vary as water levels fluctuate throughout the year. Verdon Gorge, France The Verdon Gorge's blue-green waters are a picturesque setting for activities ranging from swimming to kayaking. Mono Lake, California, United States Mono Lake, which spans 65 square miles, is known for eye-catching, calcium-carbonite structures known as tufa towers . With a high salt content, this ethereal lake is also extremely buoyant. El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico Situated outside of San Juan, El Yunque National Forest earns the distinction of being the sole tropical rainforest in the US National Forest System. Fairy Pools, Isle of Skye, Scotland Skye's enchanting Fairy Pools are only accessible on foot via the Glen Brittle forest - but it's worth the hike to see the clear waters of these natural pools in person. Beach of the Cathedrals, Galicia, Spain You'll do a double take when you see the rocky arches at the Beach of the Cathedrals: these incredible buttress-like formations were shaped solely by nature. Milford Sound, New Zealand Created by glaciers during the ice age, this fjord - located off the coast of New Zealand's South Island - is renowned for its dynamic scenery, from waterfalls to soaring mountain peaks . Jeju Island, South Korea Jeju Island boasts South Korea's highest mountain, Hallasan, a dormant volcano that towers nearly 6,400 feet above sea level . The island is also known for its spectacular lava tubes (caves formed by cooling lava). Mt. Erebus, Antarctica It may seem hard to believe, but there are volcanoes in the arctic. Mt. Erebus, the world's southernmost active volcano, dates back 1.3 million years and stretches a whopping 12,448 feet above sea level . Kjeragbolten, Norway Kjeragbolten is a 177-cubic-foot boulder nestled in a mountain crevice. It's surprisingly accessible (you don't need special equipment to reach it), which makes it a popular photo op for adventurous Instagrammers . Iguazu Falls, Argentina and Brazil Spanning Argentina and Brazil, the Iguazu Falls are part of a massive waterfall system that totals around 275 waterfalls . Tianmen Cave, Zhangjiajie, China Situated 5,000 feet above sea level , Tianmen Cave is one of the highest naturally formed arches on the planet. Visitors have to mount a 999-step "stairway to heaven" to reach the site. Masazir Lake, Azerbaijan Masazir Lake is not far from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. This pink saline lake gets its color - which is strongest in the summer - from microorganisms called halophiles . Harbour Islands, Bahamas Known mostly for its pink sand beaches, Harbour Island remains mostly untouched by humans, at least compared to the rest of the Bahamas. The island's other draws include Devil's Backbone, a coral reef filled with marine life, and Dunmore Town, whose pastel-colored homes will charm any visitor. The Blyde River Canyon, South Africa For gorgeous natural views, go for a hike along the Blyde River Canyon, which sits at an elevation of more than 2,600 feet . This canyon, known for its unique geology - including the Pinnacle, a looming quartzite column - also boasts diverse flora and fauna. Garni Gorge, Armenia The Garni Gorge is characterized by vertical cliffs notable for their basalt columns . You can only reach this breathtaking site by car.

AAB6hqa	health	medical	12 Surprising Germs Hand Sanitizer Won't Kill	As it turns out, there's a reason why most hand sanitizer companies don't claim to kill 100 percent of germs and bacteria: because they don't.	As it turns out, there's a reason why most hand sanitizer companies don't claim to kill 100 percent of germs and bacteria: because they don't. 12 Surprising Germs Hand Sanitizer Won't Kill Hand sanitizer is a daily staple for parents on diaper duty, commuters who hold those rarely-cleaned handle bars on buses and subways, and many other people in between. In fact, according to global information company NPD Group , hand sanitizer sales in the United States shot up 37 percent from 2017 to 2018 alone. And while it's perfectly fine to turn to this bottled product as a last resort, you shouldn't opt for hand sanitizer over washing your hands in the sink if there's clean water and soap available to you. As it turns out, there's a reason why most hand sanitizer companies don't claim to kill 100 percent of germs and bacteria: Because they don't. Keep reading to discover some of the viruses and germs you're leaving on your hands every time you opt for hand sanitizer instead of soap and water. And if you want to avoid falling ill at all costs, check out these 30 Smart Ways to Avoid Getting Sick When You Travel . 1. Norovirus According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , norovirus is a "very contagious virus" that can be spread via direct contact, contaminated food or drinks, and contaminated surfaces. And while thoroughly washing your hands (and your produce) is a good way to ensure your safety, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer isn't quite as effective. In one 2011 study published in the American Journal of Infection Control , researchers analyzed data from health departments in three states and found that the facilities that relied on hand sanitizer were more likely to experience a norovirus outbreak than those that favored hand-washing. 2. HPV While HPV is primarily considered a sexually transmitted infection, individuals can still contract the disease non-sexually, including through childbirth, kissing, diaper changes, and other forms of close contact, according to a 2017 study published in The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Research . And unfortunately, this is one virus hand sanitizer simply can't touch. In fact, according to one 2014 study published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy , the disinfectants used in hand sanitizer "do nothing for preventing the spread of human papillomavirus," as study author Craig Meyers noted in a press release . And if you want to make sure that you're getting rid of as many harmful bacteria as possible, This Is the Safest Way to Wash Your Hands . 3. Giardia Giardia is a microscopic parasite that causes a nasty diarrheal illness known as giardiasis. Though people most commonly get giardiasis from a contaminated water supply or food source, it is just as possible to contract the illness from person-to-person contact should someone have microscopic amounts of fecal matter on their hands. And don't think that using hand sanitizer will clear your hands of this parasite; according to the Mayo Clinic , alcohol-based sanitizers are an ineffective preventative measure against the cysts responsible for giardia's transmission. 4. Clostridium Difficile If you want to avoid dealing with the painful symptoms and illnesses associated with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) a type of bacterium that can cause everything from diarrhea to colitis then you'll want to wash your hands rather than relying on sanitizer. One 2009 study published in the journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology tested the efficacy of several different hand-washing methods to eliminate C. difficile particles. The researchers found that using an alcohol-based hand rub was as ineffective as doing nothing at all. Conversely, warm water with plain soap proved to be the most effective method for removing the bacteria. 5. Ara h1 Ara h1 is one of the most common allergens found in peanuts, meaning people with a peanut allergy need to avoid it at all costs. Unfortunately, when people use hand sanitizer instead of soap to wash up after touching peanut products, Ara h1 frequently stays on their skin. That's according to a 2004 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , which found that approximately 50 percent of subjects who used hand sanitizer after touching peanut butter still had traces of Ara h1 on their palms. As study author Robert A. Wood , M.D., explained in a press release , these sanitizers don't eliminate the allergen, but "spread it around" instead. And if you're prone to seasonal allergies, you'll want to avoid the 20 Worst U.S. Cities for Spring Allergies . 7. Enterococcus Faecium Even if your doctor uses all the hand sanitizer in the world, they might still be carrying around bacteria like Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium), which can affect the health of everything from your bladder to your heart . Though alcohol-based hand sanitizers were previously believed to safeguard against many germs, it turns out, they're no match for Enterococcus faecium. One 2018 study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine tested the tolerance of several E. faecium strains against sanitizer and found that samples collected between 2010 and 2015 were 10 times more resistant to the product's supposedly-sanitizing effects than those collected between 1997 and 2010. 8. Poliovirus As recently as the early 1950s, prior to the widespread availability of the vaccine, poliovirus was responsible for the paralyzation of more than 15,000 people each year in the United States, according to the CDC . And with polio returning to countries where it had previously been eradicated (including a World Health Organization -reported outbreak in Papua New Guinea in 2018), people are desperate for ways to reduce the virus' spread. Sadly, this is one illness that alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't protect against. Since poliovirus is a type of non-enveloped virus that can last longer in the environment, it's therefore highly contagious. So how do we know that typical hand sanitizers don't work against poliovirus? Well, when researchers from The Dental College of Georgia compared the efficacy of their green tea hand sanitizer against that of alcohol-based hand sanitizers in 2016, they found that their green tea product was 100 times more effective in immobilizing poliovirus-1 than what is currently mandated. On top of that, two commonly-used hand sanitizers tested were less effective at reducing the virus's potential to infect others. 9. MRSA MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a type of bacteria that can cause potentially fatal infections. And, as its name suggests, these infections do not respond to the antibiotic methicillin. However, that's not the only reason you should fear MRSA. Though some hand sanitizers claim to protect against the bacterium, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned back in 2011 that "these statements are unproven." "Consumers are being misled if they think these products you can buy in a drug store or from other places will protect them from a potentially deadly infection," noted Deborah Autor , compliance director at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. And if you're looking for proven methods of protecting against disease, then check out these 20 Habits That Slash Your Flu Risk . 10. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is a rod-shaped bacterium that can cause everything from ear infections to pneumonia. Though some hand sanitizer brands have proven effective against it, others are considerably less potent. In one 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Case Reports , for instance, Dettol sanitizer a hand sanitizer that claims to kill 99.9 percent of germs was found to be an inadequate line of defense against P. aeruginosa. When it comes to this type of bacteria, hand sanitizer is a total toss-up, so it's better just to wash your hands if and when you come in contact with it. 11. Staphylococcus epidermidis Don't rely on hand sanitizer to protect you from Staphylococcus (S. epidermidis). In the same 2018 study from the Journal of Clinical Case Reports , researchers found that, out of the five alcohol-based sanitizers they tested, only three were able to inhibit the growth of S. epidermidis. In other words, if you were to go to the store right now and buy a random bottle of hand sanitizer without looking at the brand name, you'd have a 40 percent chance of buying one that doesn't protect against this bacterium. 12. Escherichia Coli If you're at all familiar with the bacterium E. coli, which the CDC linked to five deaths in the United States during a 2018 outbreak, then you already know that you want to avoid it at all costs. However, using hand sanitizer isn't enough to rid your hands of this germ, especially if you work in an environment where you're in regular contact with raw food. Per one 2016 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Food Protection , the E. coli reduction achieved by hand sanitizer is "consistently lower than that obtained with water and soap." What's more, when researchers from Procter & Gamble tested plain soap, hand sanitizer, and a combination of the two on people who had just handled raw chicken and beef, they found that plain soap was most effective at eliminating the E. coli threat.

Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of Microsoft News or Microsoft. MSN Lifestyle Voices features first-person essays and stories from diverse points of view. Click here to see more Voices content from MSN Lifestyle, Health, Travel and Food. I love Mother's Day - because what mom doesn't deserve a day dedicated to her ? After all, we moms have probably the toughest and most demanding job in the world. We're responsible for the well-being of one or more miniature human beings, day and night. Now, that's pressure. So we, the mothers of the world , definitely deserve all of the honors and admiration we receive on Mother's Day, but the thing is, I don't expect my kids to celebrate me at all. Of course, my children have been presenting me with Mother's Day gifts for years now. Don't get me wrong - I love everything I've been given. Like all parents, I enjoy the stuff they made by hand the best, because it's supposed to come from the heart. The only problem is, it usually isn't. Gift-giving doesn't seem to come naturally to little kids. In fact, it's been suggested that their brains just aren't wired that way. According to research, children tend to be more self-serving than self-sacrificing, likely due to their immature prefrontal cortices (the part of the brain that moderates your social behavior). Scientists think it might explain why generosity seems to be a bit easier for us grown-ups. My oldest child dutifully supplies me with an annual Mother's Day gift . She usually makes it at school, so it's planned out by her teacher, executed step by step by every student in her class, and handed to me by the end of the day - without that twinkle in her eye I see whenever she's pleased with herself or with her actions. My youngest child also goes through the motions, scribbling on paper and giving it to me with my name scrawled on top, with the help of my husband, who basically guided his little hand through the process. I appreciate that my husband cares enough to do this. I'm grateful for the efforts of my children. But the fact that it's not their idea takes some of the steam out of it. Related gallery: These are the best Mother's Day gifts of the year Of course, we all want to raise generous, compassionate kids. Gift-giving is a tangible way to express love and other positive feelings toward another person. It's been proven that acts of generosity make us happier . It's not that I don't want my kids to be willing to devote time and resources to another human being, I would just rather it be heartfelt. Plus, it doesn't seem necessary to celebrate the fact that I'm their mom. It's part of who I am. Motherhood is one of my defining characteristics, like the fact that I have brown eyes and am a human being. I don't think it needs to have a holiday wrapped around it. A spontaneous act of love or kindness from one of my kids means a lot more to me than what they're prompted to do one designated day of the year. Of course, I think if Mother's Day is important to you, you should celebrate it! There's no right or wrong way to honor the work we mothers do. I just would prefer smaller, more spontaneous celebrations over a large, inorganic one. I do it by trying to find little ways to celebrate my kids every day of the year, and in their own little ways they celebrate me back. Whenever one of them gives me a hug "just because" or blurts out "I love you, Mom," I feel like I'm on top of the world. I don't demand it and I certainly don't expect it, but when it happens, it's celebration enough for me - on any day of the year.

BBMAcho	health	wellness	How Toothpaste Gave Me This Gross   & Painful   Problem	Check the label when trying a new toothpaste: sodium lauryl sulfate could give people canker sores.	I arrived home from a recent trip to Tadoussac, a tiny village three hours north of Quebec best known for its whale-watching, named for the Innu word for "boobs," with a belly full of airport poutine, a shaky iPhone video of an enormous humpback breaching right in front of our Zodiac boat, a souvenir T-shirt depicting several different species of baleine , and two increasingly painful canker sores , too irritating to ignore. What had I done differently in that True North, I wondered, other than eat a type of unpasteurized cheese that is illegal in the United States? The answer came to me one night days later, as I spat a mouthful of gray foam   the lather from my go-to charcoal-laced natural toothpaste   into my own bathroom sink. Because I had chosen not to check a bag for the short sojourn to Canada, being that I am so very low-maintenance, I'd requested that my boyfriend pack his travel-size toothpaste for us both. For four days and three nights I used this toothpaste, from a popular drugstore brand with which many Americans trust their teeth, once in the morning and once before bed. But using normal toothpaste like a normal American does not suit me, which reminded me of why I stopped using normal toothpaste in the first place, all those years ago: Sodium lauryl sulfate gives me, and plenty of other people, huge canker sores . "I've seen many patients with painful canker sores and mouth ulcers caused by toothpastes containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)," says dentist Ramin Tabib, D.D.S., of NYC Smile Design . "People come to us on an emergency basis worried about the sores in their mouth, and the first question we ask is whether they've switched toothpastes recently." There are a couple other ingredients in toothpaste known to cause irritation   namely pyrophosphates, which are used to control tartar, and added flavoring ingredients, to make sure you get that minty taste you like   but it's the SLS that will really knock you down and make you beg for Orajel. As Dr. Tabib explains, the strong surfactant's foaming action damages the skin's proteins and dries out the inside of your mouth, making it a severe irritant for many people. And yet you'll still find it in just about every toothpaste at the drugstore, a canker-sore catastrophe free with purchase. "The drive in keeping SLS in toothpaste is that it's manufactured inexpensively, and that the lather is something the consumer looks for and associates with 'squeaky clean,'" he says. "They are correct in that it effectively produces squeaky-clean skin surfaces, but it works too well." Dr. Tabib recommends Jason toothpaste and Sensodyne ProNamel ; I'm a fan of Schmidt's , and the fact that I am not alone. Though perhaps I'd like to be, steering a tiny boat over that big, dark expanse of water where the Saguenay and the St. Lawrence rivers meet, with my fate in the hands of the tide and the god I don't believe in, while the endangered blues swim beneath me and the belugas come up to whistle and breathe. I will bring my own toothpaste this time.

AAARL6T	entertainment	celebrity	Real-life celeb couples who fell in love on set	Check out these co-stars who fell for one another at work.	Check out these co-stars who fell for one another at work. In the real world, workplace romances are usually frowned upon. But in Hollywood, falling for your co-worker is an entirely different matter. After all, it helps to play a couple in love if you actually like the person you're acting opposite. Take KJ Apa and Britt Robertson, for example! The "Riverdale" hunk met the actress on the set of 2017's "A Dog's Purpose," but it wasn't until they played lovers on screen in "I Still Believe" that they took things to the next level off screen: The duo were spotted kissing and showing off some PDA at a party during Comic-Con 2019 , though things fizzled out not long after that. To celebrate their movie love story hitting theaters on March 13, 2020, Wonderwall.com is rounding up some more stars who found love on set! Keep reading for more... Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas filmed the thriller "Deep Water" together -- they play husband and wife -- in the fall and winter of 2019 (pictured). Then in March 2020, the co-stars were spotted visiting restaurants and museums together in the "Knives Out" star's native Cuba, where they also posed for photos with fans and spoke Spanish together. Within days, outlets including People magazine and Page Six had confirmed that a romance had blossomed. "They are definitely dating," a source told People, adding that Ben and Ana were seen making out at the airport in Havana before they boarded a private jet together. Lucy Boynton and Rami Malek met while filming the smash hit "Bohemian Rhapsody" in London in 2017 and seemed inseparable by 2018. In 2019, the couple attended major award shows together as their film dominated show after show, culminating in Rami's best actor Academy Award speech in which he thanked Lucy for being "the heart" of their film and capturing his own heart. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys started dating in late 2013 -- shortly after the "Felicity" actress separated from husband Shane Deary -- while shooting the second season of "The Americans." The co-star couple are now parents to son Sam , who arrived in 2016. Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender really hit it off in 2014 while shooting "The Light Between Oceans," in which they play a married couple who are deeply in love. Their onscreen chemistry was the real deal : The couple tied the knot in 2017. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan fell for each other while shooting the 2006 dance movie "Step Up." They tied the knot in 2009 and welcomed daughter Everly in 2013. The couple announced their shocking split in April 2018. Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth fell for each other in 2009 on the set of "The Last Song." They broke up in 2013 but found their way back to one another by early 2016. They tied the knot in December 2018 and split in August 2019. Though they didn't publicly step out as a couple until the spring of 2005 -- a few months after he announced his split from wife Jennifer Aniston -- Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt both later admitted that they fell in love on the 2004 set of "Mr. & Mrs. Smith." The parents of six tied the knot in 2014. Angie filed for divorce two years later. Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes made their debut as a couple in September 2011 shortly after they wrapped their film "The Place Beyond the Pines." The extremely private pair have since welcomed two daughters: Esmeralda and Amada . Weeks after announcing her split from husband Gavin Rossdale, pop star Gwen Stefani began dating country singer Blake Shelton , who'd just divorced Miranda Lambert, after they bonded over their shared heartbreak while filming "The Voice" together in 2015. More than four years later, the onetime co-stars are still happy and in love. Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer met on the set of Netflix's "Stranger Things," which debuted in 2016. The pair hit it off and went public as a couple in 2017. Claire Danes fell for co-star Hugh Dancy on the 2006 set of their film "Evening." They wed in September 2009 and welcomed son Cyrus in late 2012 and a second child in August 2018. Kit Harington and Rose Leslie first connected while co-starring as enemies-turned-lovers on "Game of Thrones." They split in 2013 but later reconciled before getting engaged in 2017. They wed in Scotland in June 2018. Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem were first linked in 2007 after they shot "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" together. They tied the knot in 2010 and have since welcomed two children: son Leo and daughter Luna . Lauren Morelli was married to a man and considered herself straight when she met Samira Wiley on the "Orange Is the New Black" set. After getting to know Samira as she worked through the end of her marriage, the "OITNB" writer began dating the actress. The couple got engaged and married in 2017. Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse play lovebirds Betty and Jughead on "Riverdale" -- and they're also a couple in real life. The two have been dating since early 2017. Megan Fox first met hubby Brian Austin Green when he made a guest appearance on her show "Hope & Faith" in 2004. Despite their 12-year age gap, the pair began dating and were on-and-off for six years before marrying in 2010. Megan filed for divorce in August 2015 but by early 2016, the couple was back together and expecting their third child, who arrived that August. She ended up dismissing their divorce case in April 2019. Shia LaBeouf and British actress Mia Goth met on the set of "Nymphomaniac" in 2012 and began dating. The pair held a commitment ceremony at a Las Vegas chapel in October 2016. Less than two years later in September 2018, news of their split was made public. Turns out Shia found another love on a different set... Shia LaBeouf met British singer-actress FKA Twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, on the set of the 2019 movie "Honey Boy." The two went public with their relationship in September 2018 on the heels of Shia's split from Mia Goth but nine months later, it was over. While starring in such an addictive romance, it was only natural that the stars playing Edward Cullen and Bella Swan fell for each other in real life. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart first met at director Catherine Hardwicke's home for a chemistry read for the 2008 film "Twilight," where she immediately noticed the attraction. "You could just tell that they were intensely fascinated by each other," the director later told Us Weekly. By 2009, they were an item, which delighted Twihards everywhere. Unfortunately, they didn't duplicate Bella and Edward's happily ever after. Their fairy tale relationship ended in July 2012 after news of Kristen's affair with her "Snow White and the Huntsman" director Rupert Sanders surfaced. Though Robert and Kristen gave their relationship a few more tries, things officially ended in 2013. Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty met making "Descendants 2" in 2016 and were officially dating by the end of the year. Though Dove told People magazine that their romance didn't happen right away and "was one of those natural evolutions," co-star Sofia Carson said she knew they were falling for one another early on. "From the very beginning, there was definitely chemistry there," she told People. Nearly three years later, the Disney darling and the Scottish actor are still going strong. Tori Spelling was married to actor Charlie Shanian and Dean McDermott was married to actress Mary Jo Eustace when they first got together on the 2005 set of the TV movie "Mind Over Murder." The duo ended their previous marriages, married each other in 2006 and have since welcomed five children together. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz hit it off on the 2010 set of their movie "Dream House." Not long after, he dumped girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell and she parted ways with director Darren Aronofsky. By late 2010, it was clear the comely co-stars were a real item . They wed in June 2011 and welcomed a daughter together in September 2018. Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos started dating in 1995 while playing lovers on "All My Children." They eloped in Las Vegas the following year and welcomed three kids together: Joaquin, Lola and Michael. Though Goldie Hawn has admitted that she thought Kurt Russell was "adorable" when they met as co-stars on the set of 1968's "The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band," she felt that at 21, she was too old for Kurt, then 16. But more than a decade later, they fell for one another while co-starring in 1984's "Swing Shift" -- and they've been together ever since! Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas started dating in early 2012 after hitting it off while portraying Snow White and Prince Charming on "Once Upon a Time." They tied the knot in April 2014 and welcomed a son , Oliver, the following month. They welcomed a second baby boy , Hugo, in June 2016. Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer fell for one another in 2007 while shooting the pilot episode of "True Blood." They tied the knot in 2010 and welcomed twins Charlie and Poppy in 2012. Alexis Bledel and "Mad Men" star Vincent Kartheiser fell for each other in mid-2012 when the "Gilmore Girls" actress shot a three-episode arc on the hit AMC series. They got engaged after just months of dating, tied the knot in 2014 and welcomed their first child , a baby boy, in 2015. Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin reportedly started dating in mid-2015 -- in the midst of her breakup from husband Austin Chick -- when the "Homeland" actress joined the cast of Ben's FOX series, "Gotham." The co-stars welcomed a daughter, Frances, in March 2016 and got married in June 2017. Trai Byers and Grace Gealey got engaged in July 2015 after connecting while shooting the first season of "Empire." They tied the knot on Grand Cayman Island on April 14, 2016. Longtime friends Lauren Graham and Peter Krause didn't take their relationship to the next level until 2010 when they reconnected on the set of "Parenthood," on which they portrayed siblings. They're still going strong nearly a decade later. Maggie Q and Dylan McDermott really hit it off while shooting their short-lived series "Stalker." They started dating in October 2014 and got engaged just months later. Unfortunately they never made it to the altar -- the couple split in February 2019 . Kaitlin Olson and Rob McElhenney started secretly dating while shooting the second season of their hit comedy "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." They tied the knot in 2008 and have since welcomed two kids, sons Axel and Leo. LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian fell for each other while filming the 2009 Lifetime movie "Northern Lights." There were just two problems: She was still married to Dean Sheremet and he was still married to Brandi Glanville. LeAnn and Eddie soon ended their marriages and wed each other in 2011. Emily VanCamp and Josh Bowman started dating in early 2012 during the first season of "Revenge." Though their ABC soap has come to an end, the private pair are still going strong -- they announced their engagement in May 2017 and got married in the Bahamas in December 2018.
BBLD170	tv	tv-celebrity	Caitlyn Jenner Discusses Her Rumored Relationship with Sophia Hutchins	Caitlyn Jenner Addresses Relationship with Sophia Hutchins	Caitlyn Jenner is addressing her rumored relationship with Sophia Hutchins . Although Jenner, 68, and Hutchins   a 22-year-old transgender Pepperdine University 2018 graduate   have continued to spark romance rumors in the past, the pair is maintaining that they are not a couple. "We are not going to get into that," former Olympian and I Am Cait star Jenner told Variety in a new profile published Tuesday. While the duo denied being together, Jenner, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in January 2017, did share, "But we are very close." "We do a lot of things together. We're kind of inseparable," she said. "We're the best of friends." The interview comes weeks after they attended the ESPY Awards together in July. "Sophia and I off to the ESPY's," Jenner captioned a smiling selfie of the two on Instagram. "Bringing back old memories of my first public outing. Life is good!" The two were also seen smiling while sitting side-by-side inside the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. Despite frequently posting photos of each other on social media, a source previously revealed to PEOPLE that the pair are simply good friends amongst a group of trans women with whom Jenner socializes. (Hutchins transitioned in college and cited Jenner as an inspiration to the university newspaper .) "She still has no interest in dating," the source added of Jenner. "It's just not a priority."

AABGH82	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	The 3 Easiest (and Safest) Ways to Open a Can Without a Can Opener	No tool? No problem. Here's how to get that can open in a pinch.	If this has ever happened to you, you know how frustrating it is: You're camping, or, perhaps more likely, glamping , and you're in the middle of making a canned tuna recipe , and you've got all the ingredients at the ready. You go to crack the lid of the tuna when you discover that there's no gosh-darn can opener. What to do? You could give up, turn your attention to a making refreshing summer cocktail , and see what the local takeout options are. (Can you get pizza delivered to a camp site?) But come on. You're no quitter. Thanks to this video by YouTuber Mr. Hacker , you'll find that opening a can without a can opener is far from impossible. The important thing to remember is that the lid of a can is actually a very thin piece of metal crimped onto the body of the can. Most utensils (knives, spoons, even forks) are stronger and thicker, and you only need an object that is a little bit stronger to pierce the surface with a bit of pressure. Mr. Hacker begins by showing a number of different ways to cut through the top of a can with a variety of knives and even an axe. While using something sharp may be your first thought as well, we actually recommend against it it's too easy for the knife (or axe!) to slip and accidentally cut you. The last thing you want is to have to leave dinner prep and head to the hospital! If you have a little time, we'd say the easiest (and safest) way to open a can without a can opener is by actually wearing the metal on the lid down by rubbing it with a metal spoon, then using the spoon's edge to break the rest of the seal. This is Mr. Hacker's fourth method. We have instructions below. If that doesn't work, or you want to open a can a little quicker, then our second-best recommendation of Mr. Hacker's methods is using the bottom of a chef's knife as a can opener the third method in the video. This way is a little safer because it avoids some of the risks of knife slips. It also avoids some of the bad outcomes brought on by sharp edges from a torn top. But let's say you really have no tools: Perhaps you're cooking campfire recipes , and you forgot all but the most basic and flimsy cooking gear. (Next time, pack this great camping cookware .) In that situation, the flat surface of a rock will suffice. You can simply wear the lid down! One note of warning : The edges of a can are sharp under the best circumstances, and when using unusual methods, you risk metal splinters as well as cuts from both the lid and objects used to pry open the cans. Wear safety gloves if possible, and practice extreme caution! Spoon Method If you have a little time (and a spoon) try this method: Grip the bowl (i.e. not the handle) of a sturdy spoon in the palm of your hand so the bottom sticks out a little below your pinky finger, and your four fingers are firmly grasping the bowl. Your pinky should sit inside the curve of the spoon for stabilization and easier control over the tool. With firm pressure, vigorously rub the bottom of the spoon back and forth along the crimped edge of the can, where the can opener would typically puncture. Keep rubbing until the metal thins, and you eventually create a hole. Then press the spoon into the hole, and pry the edge of the spoon upward around the edge of the can, slowly breaking the top off. Continue to work into the hole along the can's perimeter until you've created a large enough cut to pry the lid open. If you don't have a spoon, this method should work with a screw driver. You can also try to puncture the lid with the tine of a fork. (Though be warned, it may ruin your fork.) Knife Method If you need to get into the can a little more quickly, and/or are feeling relatively secure with your knife skills, you can try opening the can with a knife. If you have a pocket knife or a small paring knife, you can simply put the can on a sturdy surface and try to puncture the can with the tip of the knife. Keep puncturing holes evenly around the edge of the can, and the lid will eventually come off. However, if you have a large chef's knife, this method is even easier (and a little safer): Firmly grip the handle and position the back corner of the blade (the widest part closest to the handle) perpendicular to the can at the seam. Push the corner of the blade downwards and perforate the lid of the can by digging in at an angle. (Note: this works more or less like an old-fashioned lever-type can-opener , the kind you still find on Swiss army knives.) Repeat this process around the rim of the can until you have weakened the lid enough to pry the can open. Rough Surface Method Save this method for the moment you find yourself with no tools. All you need is a large rock or stretch of concrete, and a soft cloth for cleaning the top of the lid. The process is pretty straightforward: Find a rough surface and sand the top ridge of the can down until it breaks the seal. Wipe the metal shavings off, open the lid, and cook or eat the food inside. That's it! This process does take a while, but it will work in a pinch and our guess is that if you are trying to open a can, and you have neither a knife nor a spoon nearby, you're probably in a real pinch. A couple helpful hints: Periodically rotate the can to evenly wear down the edge and squeeze every now and again to help separate the seal. As soon as you start seeing moisture on the rock, it's a sign that the seal has broken. Related video: This Bread-Making Step is One You Don't Want to Miss! (Provided by Buzz60)

BBVQfhU	lifestyle	lifestylecareer	How to keep yourself happy and productive if you're working from home because of the coronavirus outbreak	More employees are choosing to work from home as local governments and companies take action over the growing coronavirus outbreak.	More employees are choosing to work from home as local governments and companies take action over the growing coronavirus outbreak. Woman working from home New York, Kentucky, Maryland, Utah, and Oregon have declared states of emergency in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak , in addition to the city of San Francisco. As the outbreak grows, more employees are likely to work from home, either voluntarily or by company or government mandate. Here are top tips from people who work remotely for keeping yourself grounded, including getting dressed for work each day, and managing clients' expectations. At least eight US states - including New York , Kentucky , Maryland , Utah , and Oregon - have declared states of emergency amid the growing coronavirus outbreak, in addition to the city of San Francisco . As governments and companies brace for possible local outbreaks, more employees are likely to choose to work from home. While remote work has obvious benefits, it's not all fun and games. In reality, working remotely requires discipline and can come with its share of loneliness. Remote workers are more likely than their in-office counterparts to report feeling overly stressed at work, and to struggle with maintaining a healthy work-life balance, according to a 2019 Airtasker survey of more than 1,000 professionals. We spoke with several professionals who work remotely to get their firsthand insight on how they manage to stay afloat in their work setups. Here are their best tips to keeping yourself relaxed and engaged if you work remotely. Have a dedicated work space. "Running a real-estate brokerage in Miami, there are certainly a lot of distractions that can take you away from work," Mikael Hamaoui, president at Riviera Horizons Realty, told Business Insider. "I have a dedicated area in my home that is for work only. It's critical to separate work from personal, or it's too easy to find yourself on the couch watching TV. It's imperative that anyone working from home create a dedicated work space that is free of distractions so you can stay in work mode even when you're at home - and try not to go to your home office outside of working hours and vice versa to really keep that separation." Start your morning by grounding yourself. "It's important to have a morning ritual that helps you gain focus and clarity about your goals for that day," Serena Poon , a chef and nutritionist, told Business Insider. "I start mine with meditation, my gratitude list , and affirmative thoughts before I get out of bed." Have a schedule. "The thing that keeps me sane while working remotely is having a set schedule," Kara Luton, an engineer at CrowdStrike , told Business Insider. "I wake up at the same time every day, jump in the shower, and get ready just like I would if I was going to an office." Enjoy your surroundings. "I make sure to maintain a great work-life balance while on the road, in the air, or abroad," Kiara Horwitz, CEO and founder of the PR company KHPR Inc. , told Business Insider. "When I work remotely I continue to take time to breathe, relax, enjoy my surroundings, and take personal breaks when needed. No one is dying (thankfully) in my industry, and if I need an hour to clear my head, I do so." Manage clients' expectations. "I set parameters around my work-life balance before I bring a client on board," Horwitz said. "If I'm working remotely and there is a change in time zone, I always alert my clients that I'm traveling and make sure they know when I'm able to answer emails, texts, or calls. This helps to manage expectations." Get dressed as if you're going to a meeting. "I know how much fun it is to hang out in athleisure or pajamas all day because I did it for years, but when I started getting dressed, a strange thing happened," Lindsay Anvik , keynote speaker and business coach told Business Insider. "Because I was prepared to have a last-minute meeting, coffee, or video chat, my business saw the benefits." She added: "Before, I would turn down last-minute lunches or meetings because I literally wasn't dressed, and by 2 o'clock it's hard to find the motivation to change for one thing. Don't get me wrong, I still wear slippers around the house, and will sometimes throw on a college sweatshirt instead of a button-down blouse, but if I need to, I can be out the door in five minutes. Hair is blown dry and makeup is done. I feel put together because I am together." Work in another place at least once a week. "Go to a coffee shop, a library, a restaurant, or a friend's office and work there," Anvik said. "This not only leads to the chance of meeting someone and networking but it gives you some inspiration. It provides something new to look at and new environments help breed creativity." Develop a workout routine. "Unless my body is begging me not to, I go to the gym every morning before I begin work," Daniel Berkowitz, founder of AuthorPop , a digital consultancy for authors, told Business Insider. "It's a great way to get some natural energy and it gives me a sense of accomplishment before I dig into my to-do list." Not a morning person? Others, like Sarah Segal, founder of Segal Communications , find that having something active scheduled for the end of the day helps too: "Sometimes that means a dog walk and other times it means taking a ballroom dancing class at the end of a long day." Do chores to break up your day. "When you've worked for an hour or so, empty the dishwasher or take out the trash. It's the equivalent of going to your coworker's office," Anvik said. Berkowitz said he likes doing this because even if he's not leaving his apartment, accomplishing a task, even if it's a relatively small one, allows him to feel a sense of accomplishment and refocuses his brain. Call people and make time to socialize. "I know a lot of people hate talking on the phone, but guess what? You work in your home. You may not get a ton of interaction," Anvik said. "Socializing is important to connect with clients, preventing feelings of isolation and having someone to talk to besides your dog." News to stay informed. Advice to stay safe.

SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - After a beautiful morning (and beautiful weekend), we've returned to reality with clouds and chilly temperatures. There have even been a few showers popping up, though many have remained dry. Fortunately, behind the cold front, drier air moves in for tonight. Temperatures will fall with clear skies and calming winds. If the wind goes completely calm, there could be a few spots that dip close to freezing. Tuesday looks mainly sunny and cool. Highs will top out in the upper 50s to near 60°. There will be a slight breeze out of the northwest. Wednesday will start sunny and cool, but shower chances return later in the day. A coastal system will dive to the south, throwing some rain and clouds in our direction. Another wave of low pressure will track right over southern New England Friday night into Saturday. This will bring more showers and another shot of colder-than-normal temperatures. With a slug of cold air in place, don't be surprised if some of the higher elevations see some wet snowflakes early Saturday morning. Mother's Day Weekend is looking chilly and windy, feeling more like late March than early May. Temperatures look to stay in upper 50s and low 40s with showers on Saturday. It will be mainly dry for Mother's Day with some sunshine, but staying chilly.

BBL6CAZ	autos	autosenthusiasts	1986 Toyota Corolla - Baller Hauler & Co.	Rethinking the delivery truck by way of Toyota's AE86	You think you defied the mainstream that time you painted your own valve cover, or later when you sticker bombed your rear windshield. It turns out you deviating from the herd is more difficult than any of that, and it'll take more than some used, Japanese-only armrest you scored to get noticed. Legitimate deviation, it seems, has less to do with an old armrest you and a couple thousand rare parts aficionados all think is cool and more to do with you being more like Miles Shinneman. And by being more like Miles Shinneman, we're talking about you going out and putting that armrest money toward something like a 25-year-old delivery truck. Commuting around in a wheeled box designed for transporting things like loaves of sourdough will never make you cool and Miles has the answer. Cool points are instead awarded by way of lopping off and chucking that roof and four walls and turning that one-bedroom apartment mover into an AE86 Corolla-hauler with livery to match. It's the two-vehicle arrangement that makes Miles' situation work, and it starts with that early-'90s Isuzu mover. "I kept seeing these Isuzu NPR box trucks [showing] up for cheap," Miles says about his tow vehicle search that went from diesel trucks to enclosed mattress haulers. "I figured I could build a ramp truck and fund the whole thing by selling my trailer," he reasoned. "[But] when I got the truck, I went a little wild and decided it needed to look cool as well as function, so the teardown and rebuild started." According to Miles, that AE86 of his and that box truck were never supposed to coordinate with one another like they have, but by his account "the lines matched up and it all just happened to come together." About that AE86; Miles will be the first to tell you of the condition he found it in and how he rescued the $500 Toyota from a creek bed and filled with some 50 pounds worth of mud. Junking the Corolla's original carbureted four-cylinder for the elusive 3S-GE BEAMS engine and Alteeza gearbox he swapped in was the obvious decision. The not-so-obvious move was Miles' fabricating all of its aero from steel instead of the sort of composite materials you expect things like front spoilers and side skirts to be made from. "[I] was sick of fixing fiberglass on my last drift car," he puts it, "so I built the full metal body kit." The metalwork makes its way onto that Isuzu box truck, too, and in a big way. Get past the hydraulically operated tilt deck Miles fashioned in his driveway with its remote-operated winch and you'll begin noticing details like the truck's chopped-down doors, its lopped cab, and those hand-made fender flares that've been molded into the body. Stare at the whole thing long enough and you just might make the mistake of thinking Miles does this sort of thing for a living and you'd be sorely mistaken. "[My grandpa] was always building or working on something," he says about the man he built a sand sailer from scratch with, and who he inherited his first fabricating tools from. "Those tools were the spark that got me moving on my own tool obsession that allowed me to start my fabrication life," Miles says. "If it wasn't for my grandpa, I wouldn't have ended up a fabricator." Both the hauler's and the Corolla's talking points go beyond their custom-fabricated bits, though. Like the Isuzu's diesel engine, for example, that was ditched for one of GM's LS-based, small-block V8s, also known as the Vortec 6000. Even the truck's suspension was updated by way of air bags all around, all remotely controlled with Air Lift Performance's 3H air management system. The Corolla's underside has been shown love, too, with Megan Racing coilovers and Techno Toy Tuning knuckles, control arms, and the company's four-link conversion. Talk with Miles and you'll know that something like that box truck conversion he calls the "Baller Hauler" was inevitable. "I've always customized my rides," he wants you to know. And by customized rides he's being modest. Miles' automotive archives are full of things like chopped Isuzu Rodeos and Toyota Tacomas on hydraulics as well as more drift-able specimens, like that AE86, and still more sedate varieties, like an Infiniti Q45 positioned on more than 16 degrees of negative camber. But something like that Baller Hauler, that was never meant to be. "The [Corolla] was for sure going to be a drift missile," Miles says. "The NPR was supposed to be a tow truck; it wasn't supposed to look all fancy just beat-up and rusted...a POS that would haul things like my Rodeo."

BBMKfHB	tv	tv-celebrity	ER Star Eriq La Salle Speaks Out on Vanessa Marquez's Reported Death	Vanessa Marquez's Death: ER Star Eriq LaSalle Speaks Out	Eriq La Salle is speaking out about his former ER costar Vanessa Marquez , who was reportedly identified as the 49-year-old woman authorities say was shot and killed by police in South Pasadena, California, on Thursday afternoon. "We tragically lost a member of our ER family yesterday. Vanessa Marquez played a nurse when the show first aired," La Salle, 56, tweeted Friday. "Sending out condolences to her family and friends. May she rest in eternal peace," added La Salle, who played Dr. Peter Benton on the series. We tragically lost a member of our ER family yesterday.Vanessa Marquez played a nurse when the show first aired.Sending out condolences to her family and friends.May she rest in eternal peace.   Eriq La Salle (@EriqLaSalle23) August 31, 2018 Marquez's name and age were confirmed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department   which is leading the investigation of the officer-involved shooting   but a spokesman tells PEOPLE he can not confirm it was the actress who appeared in ER , Melrose Place , Stand and Deliver and other film and TV projects. According to the L.A. Times , the Hollywood Reporter and other news outlets , it was the same Marquez. Last October, Marquez wrote a Facebook post in which she accused La Salle of sexual misconduct, including allegedly grabbing her genitals. Vanessa Marquez on ER La Salle did not respond to PEOPLE's request to comment. Marquez also alleged the other actors made "daily attacks on my Mexican heritage" and accused ER costar George Clooney of contributing to her being "blacklisted." "Clooney helped blacklist me when I spoke up abt harassment on ER. 'Women who don't play the game lose career' I did," Marquez said, according to Page Six . Clooney, however, denied the claims, according to a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter . "I take her at her word. I was not a writer or a producer or a director on that show. I had nothing to do with casting. I was an actor and only an actor. If she was told I was involved in any decision about her career then she was lied to. The fact that I couldn't affect her career is only surpassed by the fact that I wouldn't," Clooney added. Marquez was reportedly shot following a welfare check at an apartment complex for someone "who was possibly suffering from a medical condition," according to authorities. Police claim they came across a woman who "became uncooperative." She was then shot around 1:48 p.m. after she allegedly "armed herself" with a BB gun and pointed it at officers," the South Pasadenan reported. Remembering the Stars We've Lost in 2018:
AAB2EcG	health	weightloss	Experts Agree: Yoga Can Help You Lose Weight, Especially If You Do This Type of Practice	Losing weight through yoga sounds almost too good to be true. Vinyasa yoga is the practice to choose.	Losing weight through yoga sounds almost too good to be true. On the surface, yoga seems like the polar opposite of a fast-paced high-intensity interval training (HIIT) circuit or a weightlifting workout , the two kinds of exercise usually recommended for weight loss. A yoga class leaves your body feeling totally different: refreshed instead of wiped out, loose and flexible instead of tight. It's even good for your mental health , helping you deal with stress and anxiety. HIIT, weightlifting, and cardio are fun and effective for weight loss, but they're also not for everyone. If yoga sounds more appealing and weight loss is your goal, it's natural to wonder if your daily practice can help you shed pounds. Yes, You Can Lose Weight With Yoga "Yoga can be a good source of exercise," said Jorianne Numbers, MS, an exercise physiologist with Northwestern Medicine. At the most basic level, she said, yoga is a form of movement that helps you burn calories, which is a major part of losing weight (though your exact amount burned will depend on your height, weight, and gender). But there's more behind yoga's relationship with weight loss than first meets the eye. An effective practice also fosters a mind-body connection that makes you more mindful in every facet of your life. "Yoga brings you into a heightened state of awareness," explained Lara Heimann, physical therapist, yoga instructor, and founder of LYT Method , a yoga certification program. Moving through different poses and holds increases your awareness of your body, and that can translate to other effective weight-loss habits, like eating healthy, which is key for losing weight no matter what exercise you're doing. (Try this two-week eating plan to get started.) "The congruency between mindfulness on and off of the mat is what can make yoga more effective for weight loss than other forms of exercise," Lara told POPSUGAR. Yoga has long been regarded as an effective way to relieve stress, and that on its own can be a weight-loss tool. "Having a less stressful life, and fewer stress hormones such as cortisol, can help anyone lead a healthier lifestyle," explained Liza Janda, a certified yoga instructor at Yoga Janda . Cortisol is an appetite stimulant, hence why we tend to eat (and overeat) when we're stressed out and to crave unhealthy foods in particular. A relaxing yoga practice can help you deal with stress in a healthier way and even avoid it, and the related weight gain, altogether. Which Practices Are Best For Weight Loss? If you're looking for pure calorie burn, our experts agreed that fast-paced Vinyasa yoga is the practice to choose. "A good Vinyasa class will take you through a variety of movements, with a focus on integrating your core and weight-bearing on your hands and feet," Lara explained. Imagine a classic flow from plank to triceps push-up to Upward Facing Dog - you're getting a core burn, working your triceps, then using your arms to hold up your bodyweight as you stretch. This kind of weight-bearing move "increases heart rate and builds muscle," Liza told POPSUGAR. The more muscle you build, the more calories you'll burn even after you're done exercising . Power yoga is another good choice, Jorianne told POPSUGAR, though it's more intense and better suited for people who are already in good shape. "In power yoga, there is less meditation and more of a focus on standing poses and faster-paced movement," she explained. Your heart will pump even harder than in a Vinyasa class, which is good news for losing weight; Liza recommended aiming for a heart rate that's 55 to 85 percent of your maximum to get the most calories burned out of a class. (Use this guide to calculate your max heart rate and find your target zones .) And what about hot yoga ? "Vinyasa classes burn more calories than the hot yoga," Lara told POPSUGAR. "Hot yoga makes you feel like you're working harder than you actually are because your body is just trying to thermoregulate ." Basically, sweating more doesn't mean you're burning more calories . "The sweat you produce should come simply from physical exertion," Liza said, not from temperature. A more gentle yoga class, such as Hatha, won't burn as many calories. But it can benefit your mental health and decrease stress levels while helping you be more mindful, all of which have weight-loss benefits as well. How Often Should I Do Yoga to Lose Weight? For the best weight-loss results, Liza recommended doing yoga three times a week. Continue to stay active and get your heart rate up on the other three to four days as well, whether through cardio , weightlifting , or HIIT workouts of 45 minutes to an hour. And keep your nutrition in mind, too. "Exercise alone without dieting makes losing weight hard," Jorianne said. "Weight loss occurs when you burn more calories than you consume." If you eat healthy and burn calories, though, the results will come, and yoga has a place in the process. Start with this 30-minute power flow to relax, rejuvenate, and work up a sweat.

On a flat surface, arrange the stamps to spell out your word. Measure the word's length, and divide that number in half. Measure that distance to the left of your board's center point and mark the spot. The left side of your word's first letter should align with this mark.

Using a hammer and a four-penny nail, punch holes through all four marks. Step 2: For each of the four watchband pieces, measure and mark a spot 1/8 inch from the end that would attach to a watch. Use the hammer and nail to punch through all four marks. Step 3: Place one buckle-end watchband piece atop the front cover, aligning the punched holes. Push one 5/16"W × 5/16"L brass rivet through both holes; set according to package instructions (Rivets and Setter Kit, $12; amazon.com ). Repeat for the other hole and buckle-end watchband piece.

Step 1: Start with an adjustable brass "ring blank," the band that wraps around your finger ($6.50 for 10; findings.etsy.com ). Step 2: If your button has a shank on the back, snip it off with wire-cutting pliers and sand down the back surface with a rotary tool (Dremel 4.8-volt, $24.97; homedepot.com ). Step 3: Apply a thin layer of metal-bonding glue (Beacon's Glass, Metal & More glue, $6.99 for two ounces; createforless.com ) to the back of your button, then adhere it to the top of the ring blank. If you'd like to add a second button, apply a thin layer of the glue to its back side, then adhere it atop the first button. Let dry for 24 hours. Scarf Watchband It's easy to fall in love with vintage scarves at flea markets and thrift stores. The hard part? Finding a fresh way to wear the ladylike relics. Here's one: Just remove the straps from a watch, then weave a scarf through the watch's lugs (the bars that hold the straps in place). Wrap the scarf's ends around your wrist and secure with a knot to make a timely fashion statement. Sewing Pattern Flowers An elementary school craft takes on a sophisticated edge when fashioned from the tissue-thin paper of old sewing patterns. Step 1: For each flower, cut six 7-inch squares from the pattern. Stack and fold them accordion-style six times, forming a one-by seven-inch rectangle. Snip off the corners of the rectangle with scissors . Step 2: Tightly twist a wire floral stem around the center of the rectangle. Step 3: Fan out the paper, then pull apart each layer, creating the blossom. Dress Up a Plain Hat with Raffia Flowers Boost even the most basic topper with a row of raffia flowers. Here's how to make each blossom, in three steps: Step 1: Cut a piece of cardboard that's approximately four inches long and one inch wide. Cut a length of raffia to approximately six feet ($7.50 for 60 feet; raffit.com ) . Tightly wrap the raffia around the cardboard lengthwise. Step 2: Carefully slide the wrapped raffia bundle off the cardboard, then tie a two-inch length of raffia around the bundle's middle. Snip through the looped raffia at both ends. Repeat three more times to create four bundles. Step 3: Stack the bundles atop one another as shown, then tie the entire stack together in the middle with a three-inch-length of raffia. Fan the bundles to make the flower appear full. Repeat as desired, making enough flowers to encircle your hat's brim. To attach the blooms to one another, and your hat, cut another length of raffia to approximately four feet. Slide the raffia through the center knot of each flower. Push the flowers together, then tie the raffia around your hat's brim and trim any excess raffia   to fashion a bonnet in full bloom.

BBLUFYs	news	newsus	The Trump administration is dismantling financial protections for the military	Predatory lenders disproportionately target military members. The CFPB will no longer supervise them.	The federal government's top consumer watchdog has decided it no longer needs to proactively supervise banks, credit card companies, and other lenders who deal with members of the military and their families to make sure they're not committing fraud or abuse. Critics, baffled by the decision from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, say it will put service members in the claws of predatory lenders and put their careers and livelihoods   and potentially US national security   at risk. The bureau's supervisory staff offices have typically conducted proactive checks that make sure lenders aren't charging military members exorbitant interest rates, pushing them into forced arbitration, or otherwise not following guidelines outlined in the Military Lending Act , a 2006 law that protects active duty military members and their families from financial fraud, predatory loans, and credit gouging. Now the agency, under interim director Mick Mulvaney , is planning to end its use of these supervisory examinations of lenders, according to recent reports from the New York Times and NPR . Instead, the bureau will only be able to take action against lenders if it receives a complaint. The agency says the rule change is simply an effort to roll back the agency's overly aggressive practices under its first director, Richard Cordray , and isn't technically part o the law, anyway. Consumer protection advocates and other critics say it's an unnecessary move that will ultimately harm members of the United States military who are often disproportionately targeted by payday lenders and other lenders that charge exorbitant interest rates and fees. "This is akin to removing your sentries from guard posts on military compounds. If you do that, you'll have the expectation that the bad guys will try to penetrate your compound and will probably be successful," retired Army Col. Paul Kantwill, who recently left a position at the consumer protection agency, told me. "That's exactly what this type of action would result in." This is part of a broader effort by Mulvaney to roll back protections at the CFPB. A longtime opponent of the bureau's mere existence, the former South Carolina Congress member has sought to scale back its reach and authority since taking over. Members of the military are particularly vulnerable to predatory lenders Members of the military are often disproportionately targeted by predatory lenders   financial institutions and other creditors who convince borrowers to accept unfair terms to get a loan, lie to them or coerce them, or give loans out to people they know won't be able to pay them back. Service members are often young, financially inexperienced, and have little to no credit. The Times notes that Department of Defense studies over the past decade have found that service members, their families, and veterans are four times as likely to be targeted by predatory lenders. The Military Lending Act, passed in 2006 with bipartisan support, was meant to address this problem by creating new protections for members of the military. In 2007, the Department of Defense put together the first set of rules implementing the law. Initially, they were rather skeletal   they covered payday, vehicle title, and tax refund anticipation loans and were aimed at taking out the most egregious lenders. Then, in 2013 , more rules were implemented to cover more financial products, including credit cards, and in 2015 , the Defense Department published more revisions, including supervisory responsibilities for the CFPB. As it stands, the Military Lending Act outlines guidelines for lenders : They can't charge military members an annual interest rate of more than 36 percent; they can't push them into forced arbitration; they can't require them to allot portions of paychecks to pay back their loans, and creditors can't charge a penalty for early payment. "This should be a unified front that you're not going to be setting up predatory shops or exploit loopholes for deployed folks," Patrick Murray, associate legislative director at Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, said. "They're out there doing some pretty tough work." Until now, the CFBP   which has supervisory authority over products that it decides could pose a risk to consumers   has been able to undertake proactive, supervisory examinations of lenders to make sure they're complying. Proponents of the system say it's worked out well. The agency says it's delivered more than $130 million in relief to service members since 2011 and handled more than 71,000 consumer complaints from them and their families. It has also taken enforcement actions after discovering lenders who broke the law. Getting rid of the proactive examinations is "literally going to be putting service members back in the crosshairs of predatory lenders," said Scott Astrada, federal advocacy director at consumer advocacy group the Center for Responsible Lending. The bureau will still take complaints from military members and those who believe they've been victims of abuse made on its website or hotlines. But it won't proactively be supervising lenders to make sure they comply. That, experts say, could have harmful consequences for military service members and their families. It could leave them vulnerable to predatory and deceptive practices that ultimately land them in hard-to-escape debt cycles that result in service members getting in so much debt they lose their security clearances, are kicked out of the military, or even, in the most dire cases, court-martialed. "Focus on enforcement, only, may mean that a military family has already suffered harm, a security clearance may have been lost, a career has been jeopardized" before some sort of compensation takes place, Kantwill said. He added that CFPB supervision is good for both the military and lenders, who it helps to comply with the law before complaints are launched. In fact, many of the enforcement actions taken by the bureau on this front came before supervisory examinations were enacted. Besides the possible changes under the Military Lending Act, NPR reports that the Trump administration has also proposed changes that could open service members up to predatory practices when they buy cars. The administration has proposed easing restrictions on "gap insurance," an add-on to car insurance that covers the difference between the amount a car owner owes on the car and the car's actual cash value. Gap insurance is typically available from regular insurance companies for a very low price, as little as $20 to $30 a year, but car dealers often mark it up by hundreds of dollars. Current rules effectively block auto dealers from tacking on overpriced gap insurance to military service members, but the administration has sent a proposal to the Defense Department looking to revise the rules. (If the proposal does eventually make it out of the Defense Department, it will ultimately require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney also heads.) "If they're trying to roll back those types of protections, we are absolutely going to raise hell about that," Murray, of the VFW, said. Mick Mulvaney has rolled back a lot of what the CFPB was doing Since becoming interim director of the CFPB in November 2017, Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, has undertaken a number of efforts to roll back the bureau's role in enforcement and oversight. He has eased restrictions and dropped enforcement actions , dismantled advisory boards to the bureau , and even gone as far as to try to change the agency's acronym . (He's also been kinder than his predecessor to the payday lending industry than his predecessor, members of which donated to his past congressional campaigns , though last week he did take action against one company .) Mulvaney claims he's simply following the law. He says he will go as far as stipulated under the Dodd-Frank Act, the landmark financial regulation law that set up the bureau, and under other regulations, but no further. According to NPR, the bureau says it doesn't have the legal authority to actively seek out violations of the Military Lending Act and will ask Congress to give it express permission to do so. "Under new leadership, the bureau has engaged in a comprehensive review of its activities and is assessing whether those activities align with its statutory authority. MLA is one authority, among many, that the bureau has examined," CFPB spokesperson John Czwartacki said in an emailed statement. "The bureau expects to convey its findings to Congress and to seek legislative clarity where warranted." Critics of the latest move point out that there haven't been legal challenges to the CFPB's supervision under the military lending law in the past. "This is the first time this has ever been raised as an issue to us, and it seems the prior administration had found that it had all the authority it needed to protect service members," a Democratic congressional aide, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about the matter, told me. "This is a little odd that this administration is saying there isn't enough authority." Meanwhile, all of this is unfolding as Congress considers a nominee to head the consumer protection agency   and Democrats have seized on it to argue that the Trump administration is harming the troops. "There is clear, bipartisan support in Congress to protect military families, and it is unfortunate that the Trump Administration seems more interested in defending sketchy lenders than the men and women who defend our nation," Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), one of the bill's cosponsors, said in an emailed statement. Reed, a former member of the military himself , pressed Kathy Kraninger , Trump's nominee to become permanent director of the CFPB, on the Military Lending Act and the bureau's role in enforcing it during her confirmation hearing before the Senate in July. She repeatedly said she is committed to enforcing and following the law   a line not so different from that being used by Mulvaney, that he's just doing what the statute says, and no more. Whether Kraninger or Mulvaney is in charge of the CFPB might not make a difference if she believes, as Mulvaney does, that supervision is not part of the bureau's mandate under the Military Lending Act. Murray, from the VFW, said he hopes that shining a light on what the administration is considering right now will cause it to reverse course. "It seems like it's a behind the scenes effort to do these things until they get pointed out," he said. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence travelled to Fort Drum in New York on Monday , where they addressed troops and celebrated the signing of the National Defense Authorization Act. Trump promised to "strengthen our military like never before." Sen. Reed weighed in on the juxtaposition on Twitter, calling it "shameful." Today, Pres Trump is signing the #FY19NDAA into law & touting its many benefits for our servicemen & women. But at the same time, his Admin is rolling back #MLA protections for our troops & #milfams & making them more vulnerable to predatory financial practices. Shameful.

No matter how organized you try to keep your living space, we all know how easy it is for all sorts of junk to pile up in your home. If you don't know where to begin with spring cleaning this year, start by decluttering and getting rid of all those things you no longer have use for, like outdated electronics and old clothing   after all, just about everyone can appreciate the sense of calm and relief that comes with a newly clean space! The good news is that decluttering your home is super easy if you just carve out an hour or two to do it. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities to donate and give some things you have no use for to people in need. Of course, if you've experienced clutter-related stress in the past, you know the toughest part is often figuring out where to begin   which is why we've compiled a list of common household items you should start with when you get to decluttering. Whether it's your home office, your kitchen, or your bedroom (or all of the above), here are 65 things to get rid of in your home for some easy ways to clean things up and get organized   trust us, you'll feel much better when you've finally tossed all that old junk! Old Cords Sorry to break it to you, but you'll probably never use your old cords again. Technology becomes dated so quickly these days, so it's safe to say you can get rid of that cord you're holding onto from your iPhone 2. RELATED: How to Dispose of Everything, Including Old Cell Phones, Mattresses, and Batteries Expired Coupons Have you actually used that plastic baggy holding all your coupons lately? Most of them are probably expired, and therefore unusable. Comb through your coupon book, or better yet   just throw it out and start over. Old Calendars As soon as it turns into a new year, it's safe to say you won't need your outdated calendar from last year. If you haven't thrown out your old calendars or planners , now is a good time to get rid of them. Old Takeout Menus Almost all delivery places have their menus online now, so there's no need for the paper clutter of a takeout menu. Just toss them in recycling! RELATED: 10 Expert Tips for Eating Healthy When Dining Out Glasses With an Outdated Prescription If the only thing wrong with your glasses is that they're the wrong prescription, donate them ! A person in need could be using them. Product Manuals Once you put the furniture together, there's no need for the manual. You'll never use them again, so toss any directions or manuals you have lying around. Last Year's Sunscreen Old sunscreen loses its ability to protect you from the sun's rays over time, so it's better to just get a new bottle if you don't know how old it is. RELATED: 12 Best Sunscreens to Protect Your Skin, According to Skincare Experts Old Receipts Unless it's a tax-deductible purchase, you don't need them. So you can definitely throw out those mile-long drugstore receipts. Cardboard Boxes When you're done moving, it's time to get rid of the cardboard boxes. If you need long term storage, try some nicer storage boxes . Board Games You Don't Play It's no fun to play a board game that has missing pieces, especially if you rarely play board games as is. Consider donating them to your local charity, hospital, or library instead! RELATED: 15 Best Board Games to Play With the Whole Family Right Now Unmatched Socks Everyone has a sock drawer with at least a handful of single socks that lost their partner somewhere along the way. Maybe the laundry gnomes got to them, or maybe it was the family pet. Either way, the only reason to hold onto single socks is to get crafty and repurpose them. Shop Now Excess Hair Ties Your hair deserves better than something that's been on your floor for who knows how long. Here are some ideas to help you organize your hair accessories . Plastic Utensils Whether you've stockpiled forks and knives from takeout food or you have a stash leftover from some party, it's definitely time to ditch the plastic. The environment will thank you. Consider bamboo cutlery as an alternative. RELATED: 45 Tiny Lifestyle Changes You Can Make Right Now to Help Save the Earth Open Bottles Alcohol doesn't stay good forever ... Who knew? Hard liquor has a longer shelf life of about two years before it starts to evaporate and change. Uncorked bottles of wine are a different story. Red wines should be drank within two weeks of opening a bottle. White wine should be used within three days. These rules may require a restocking of the liquor cabinet. Old Condiment Packets Your favorite takeout place gives you enough packets for four people when you're ordering for two, but you really don't want the unfortunate surprise of opening up a drawer and finding one has sprung a leak. Make these homemade versions if you find yourself in need. Baby Stuff We'll acknowledge that it's seriously sad to get rid of those old onesies. But if the clothes are in good condition, they can help a family in need . Or, if they're too damaged for donating, try one of these DIYs . RELATED: The Clothing Brands That Make the Best Baby Clothes DVDs This one might sting a little. People carefully curate their movie collection only to find the technology get phased out. You don't need to abandon all of your favorites, but you could easily clear up some space in your house by dumping the movies that are available to stream . Dull Knives It might be time to toss your old knives, especially steak knives that were cheap to begin with and can't easily be sharpened. They're actually more harmful and dangerous than your sharpest knife. Donate old knives, but make sure you wrap the blade with cardboard beforehand (and label it!) for safety. Shop Now Old Workout Gear There's no reason to get rid of perfectly good clothing or accessories, but athletic gear gets worn out faster. For example, sports bras worn consistently for several workouts per week should be replaced every six months. Running sneakers are good for about eight months. Things like yoga mats and water bottles can be used for several years before it's time to upgrade. Former Best Sellers Pass on your former favorite beach reads to friends by holding a book swap. Or, find a Little Free Library   these are mini-bookshelves that pop up anywhere filled with free books to take. RELATED: 20 Books All Students Should Read Before They Turn 18 Dated Reference Books Outdated information won't expand your horizons, so unless you use these for historical reference, pass them on. Many thrift stores say no to old reference books, so look for community groups who use them for crafting and collages. Old Medication We tend to hold onto these for fear of making a mistake of throwing out new pills, rather than a temptation to hold onto these for future maladies. For peace of mind, follow the FDA's advice by first checking to see if your old medication is on the list of those that should be flushed. If not, they recommend tossing medications by mixing it into coffee grounds or old kitty litter (key word: old ), and blacking out any info on your prescription bottles. Unused Craft Supplies You heard that knitting can be great for de-stressing, so you threw yourself into it, but haven't touched your supplies in months. Either you knit, or you don't. If you're leaning toward "you don't," donate these excess supplies to a local senior center. Expired Spices Because at some point, it's no longer cinnamon   it's flavorless dust. Find out when to get rid of other pantry basics that are past their prime. RELATED: 15 Genius Ways to Organize the Spices in Your Cabinet, Drawer, or Pantry CD Collections There are arguments to be made for hanging onto these, but anything that you don't love can go straight to a thrift store. Anything you do love? Take a day to upload it to your computer. Old Towels You can cut them up to use them as rags, or you can donate them to local animal shelters, who always are in need of these for bedding. Shop Now Worn Sheets They've been washed so many times they're practically translucent. Like old towels, many animal shelters need these for keeping pups and kitties warm. And keep your set in tip-top shop for as long as possible by avoiding these mistakes . RELATED: 11 Best Bed Sheets, According to Bedding Experts Plastic Grocery Bags You know not to throw them out, so you hold on to them in an ever-increasing mass. Instead, round them up, then take them to a place that'll recycle them for you . Better yet, start using reusable grocery bags instead! Reusable Totes If you frequent eco-friendly marketplaces, yet always manage to forget a tote, you've likely developed quite a collection. But these aren't eco-friendly if you're not using them more than once . Donate the excess to a charity, or give them to friends the next time you head to a flea market. Promotional T-Shirts You probably won't wear that random t-shirt you got free with a charity donation, so either donate it or DIY with it. RELATED: 8 Cool Things You Can Make With a T-Shirt VHS Tapes Don't fall for that eBay urban legend that certain tapes command a ton of money. Though many thrift stores will refuse these donations, VHS tapes can often be recycled with e-waste . Extra Buttons With the way clothes are made these days, by the time you need to replace the button on your cardigan, it'll be worn out. Give them to a kid for crafting (buttons are like jewels to kids for some reason), or donate them to your favorite sewing friend. Better yet, try one of these new ways to use buttons around the house. Clear Florist Vases These freebies pile up underneath sinks across the world, taking up real estate that's needed for cleaning supplies. Keep a few favorites (you can even turn them into a fun DIY project ), then donate the rest. Lidless Containers Where do they go? Maybe one day Neil deGrasse Tyson can teach us about the black hole these manage to find. Until then, recycle any without a partner. RELATED: The Best Food Storage Containers for Keeping All Your Leftovers Fresh Fancy Moisturizers This is a special shout-out for those types who invest in skincare, then become too afraid to use it up too quickly, then just flat-out don't use it. It's safe to assume these little jars are now filled with bacteria . Old Makeup Again, you might hang on to that ancient mascara because it was expensive, but using old eye makeup can lead to a nasty infection. That's why experts recommend tossing it after three months . Dead Batteries It's such a tease when you need new batteries for the remote, and none from the junk drawer actually work. Don't make yourself go through this experience ever again. Here's how you can recycle batteries . Wire Hangers We keep a few since they're handy for random household use , but they stretch out clothes, so they're not ideal for sweaters or shirts. Don't worry, you can recycle them! RELATED: 30 Smart Closet Organizer Ideas to Maximize Your Storage Space Plastic Hangers While these are better than wire, they can also stretch out clothing. Donate them as you switch to velvet hangers for slippery items and inexpensive wood hangers for jackets. Shop Now Damaged Dishes A chip may not seem like a problem, but over time, water can soak into the plate with every wash, leading to nasty bacteria growth . And the moisture can create bigger cracks if the plate or bowl is microwaved. Since you can't donate these pieces for safety reasons, try one of these creative upcycling ideas . Old Nail Polish One of each color will suffice. You'll likely never use all of it, and it's almost impossible to tell the difference between "ballet pink" and "whisper pink" anyway. Forgotten Condiments Are you hosting a hot dog eating contest? If not, there's no reason to have 10 different bottles of mustard. It's likely that the bottles are all kind of dried out anyway. RELATED: 40 New Uses for Things You Were Going to Throw Away Costume Jewelry We're not talking about valuable gems and jewelry made from precious metals, but the cheaper pieces that are usually made of plastic. Maybe it was a gift. Maybe it was a bargain too good to pass up. But if you don't wear it, send it off to the donation pile. Office Supplies Even if you work from home, you'll never go through 20 Post-it note pads. Donate them to a non-profit or charitable organization. Still have a ton left? Here's how to use office supplies to help organize your home . Unidentifiable Leftovers If you can't identify that foil packet or filled freezer bag with a glance, toss it. After all, frozen mush is far from appetizing, right? RELATED: 8 Smart Ways to Keep All of Your Leftovers Organized Your Loofah Apparently, these are only supposed to have a lifespan of three weeks before they actually get you dirtier than cleaner. Yikes. Shop Now Big or Small clothes Follow this rule of thumb: If it's more than two sizes in any direction, chances are it'll be out of style by the time it fits. Don't let college-era clothes take up precious closet space (or brain space). Dated Magazines We give you permission to save a couple of prime vintage copies; otherwise, recycle the entire stack. If your collection goes back to include issues from the early '00s and above, it might be worth putting issues up individually on eBay. Especially if you browse them for some hilariously outdated advice. Old Pens While watching TV, test each pen out from your over-flowing cup. If it doesn't work, it goes into the garbage. RELATED: The Best Pens for Back-to-School Season and Beyond Leftover Paint You've dutifully kept it in your garage after painting the living room. But even if it hasn't dried out completely, it's likely to no longer match the room   wall paint can lighten or darken over time depending on the formula or environment. Here's how to properly get rid of it. Painful Shoes They may be cute, but, boy, do they hurt. Organize a clothing swap with friends to see if there's a Cinderella who doesn't find peep-toe platforms torturous. And no, you're not imagining things if you find many styles of flats to be just as bad . Novelty Appliances Whether it was a Star Wars toaster or an ordinary waffle maker (and it's always a waffle maker), you used it once and decided it was more trouble than it's worth. Liberate it from your cabinet and make someone else's day by donating it. Old Bras Not only are most of us not washing these correctly, we're also hanging onto them for much longer than we should. Here are just some of the signs that it's time to say goodbye to a not-so-supportive bra. RELATED: 16 Best Bras for Every Cup Size and Body Type Specialty Baking Pans Sure, everyone loves that super-cute flower-shaped cake you make once a year, but the rest of the year, it just takes up space. It's better to stick to the basics. Forgotten Candles If it's still new, donate or pass the candle you were gifted in a scent you can't stand to a friend who does love it. Or toss it if it looks like it was found in the Haunted Mansion. Shop Now Excess Mugs These are always given as gifts, so it's likely that you have more than there are people in your home. Keep your favorites and donate the rest. Once you pare down, here are a few ways to keep your collection organized . Change Jar No, we're not saying to throw that away. Instead, cash it in! RELATED: The 52-Week Money Challenge Is an Easy Way to Save Almost $1,400 Instagram It's one thing to decompress with a glance through social media, but if you find yourself scrolling and scrolling and scrolling instead of connecting with others, you could be doing more harm than good to your mental well-being   not to mention to your relationships. Empty Journals Either take up the habit, or pass along the empty journals to someone who could get use out of them. Although, these health benefits might convince you to embrace it once and for all. You might also want to consider conserving paper by upgrading to a reusable smart notebook. Shop Now Old Mattresses Don't clutch your imaginary pearls just yet   this is only recommended if yours is old. Experts say that a mattress should be replaced every eight years , by which time it would have amassed 10 pounds of dead skin cells. RELATED: The Definitive Guide to Buying a Mattress Old Phones You've upgraded, yet that old phone has languished in the junk drawer. Are you creating a museum of outdated tech? We didn't think so. Here's how to get rid of it . Travel Toiletries There are better ways to remember a vacation than the tiny bottles of toiletries that are currently cluttering up your under-sink cabinet. If they're many, many years old, it's time to toss 'em. If they're on the newer side, either use them or donate them to a shelter . It'll make it easier to organize the ones you're holding on to. Exhausting "Friends" Yes, even on Facebook (block or hide their updates if unfriending them will cause more trouble). Trust us: "Friends" that exhaust you just aren't worth the trouble. Old Cards This one is an emotional minefield, but you'll feel better once it's done. Let yourself keep a few cards (especially if from a now-departed loved one) that are meaningful, but recycle the rest. Or, use them as the basis for a craft . Unwatched Programs Watching episodes pile up on your DVR can be oddly stressful for something that should be a relaxing activity. Clear it out and start fresh.

Hint: You'll need to tap into all your senses!	Nothing says "summer" like a sweet and juicy melon! ( Especially an extra-refreshing watermelon. ) That's why getting home and finding you've purchased a lackluster cantaloupe, honeydew, or watermelon is so disappointing. This guide will show you how to tell if a melon is ripe before you make your decision in the produce section. Conventional wisdom says thumping a melon is the best way to tell if it's sweet and juicy. But here's what you should do first: How to Pick a Watermelon Start by looking at the skin's "finish." A ripe watermelon will have a dull skin which is somewhat unexpected. You also don't want to see bruises, spots, or cracks. You'll also notice most watermelons develop a spot where they rest on the ground, and when it's yellow (and you don't see any stripes on the patch), the melon should be ripe and ready to slice. After all that, you can tap or thump the melon with your palm a ripe watermelon should sound hollow and make a thunk sound. Then learn what fruits and vegetables are in season every month of the year . How to Pick a Cantaloupe or Honeydew To choose a cantaloupe or honeydew, start by checking the number of segments or dark furrows. The more the better! Then, give the melon a sniff where it was attached to the vine. It should have a subtle, sweet smell but not a strong one (that's a sign of an over-ripe fruit). Be sure to check the melon's color and tone. The best and sweetest cantaloupe should have golden undertones. Like the watermelon, a dull honeydew is a ripe honeydew. Do Some Heavy Lifting Before you make your final decision, pick up the melon and make sure it feels heavy for its size. Compare a few similar-sized melons to find the heftiest one. If there's a stem, it should not be squishy-soft but should yield to gentle pressure from your thumb. If there's no stem, check the blossom end (that's the opposite end) the same way. No matter which melon is on the menu, taking the time to use all of your senses will yield juicy results! Psst ... See what melon keeps ripening after you buy it and what melon doesn't. Now that you know everything about how melons ripen, find out about some produce mistakes you didn't know you were making . RELATED VIDEO: Is Your Oven Working Correctly?

BBO1cwm	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	How to Make a Grilled Cheese Like a Chef	Take your grilled sandwich from basic to brilliant.	Like the PB&J, the grilled cheese is generally considered child's play. And perhaps it's this nostalgic element that makes the grilled cheese one of the most satisfying comfort foods to eat as an adult. Even though it's pretty difficult to mess this one up, it's definitely possible (anyone who disagrees hasn't burnt their own grilled cheese at 3 in the morning); and it's also the sort of thing that can easily go from good to great. So we turned to the country's best chefs to find out how to take this sandwich to the next level. As you go forth on this endeavor to make this idiot-proof meal, keep the wise words ofAtlanta's Linton Hopkins of Holeman & Finch in mind. "Remember the balance: Bread, cheese, fat, cooking method," he says. "All must be in alignment in order to achieve a great grilled cheese. The joy is in the playing with the combinations." Step one: Bread While melting cheese on any bread is delicious, not all bread works when making the perfect grilled cheese. "A baguette would not work too much crust," says L.A.'s favorite French chef, Ludo Lefebvre of Trois Mec . "I like an all-American white bread." It's not just French style bread that fails here. "Do not use ciabatta, focaccia, or breads with large crumb factor," says Jaime Young of New York's Sunday In Brooklyn , who opts for a soft white bread like brioche, Texas toast, or challah. Nightbird's Kim Alter in San Francisco chooses her bread according to the dress code. "For a non fancy grilled cheese, white bread is perfect," she says. "When you are going fancy a rich sourdough with a thick crust is best." Baltimore's Julian Marucci, of Tagliata is also on the crusty bread train. "Country-style or possibly a sourdough are great for grilled cheese," he says. "I'd actually avoid plain white bread. Grilled cheeses are so simple, using different breads is another great way to experiment." Step two: Cheese The cheese is what holds this whole meal together literally and figuratively. Hopkins makes his cheese decision alongside the bread pick. "The bread determines the cheese and vice versa," he says. "For example, a brioche and American cheese sandwich with big thick cut slices would be horrible, though thinly shaved brioche and comte grilled cheese are amazing." Some of his favorite combos are Swiss alpine cheeses with rye, a blend of asiago with cheddar on sourdough, Kraft American cheese on white bread, and aged Minas cheese from Brazil on whole wheat. Our European expert recommends European cheeses. "My favorite cheeses are gruyère and emmental. Use a good black truffle cheese, you can never go wrong with truffle." says Lefebvre. "Make sure to shred the cheese instead of [using] slices; it melts better." Marucci also votes for gruyère. "I typically go for cheddar, gruyere, or fontina. Even better, combine all three," he says. The cheese selection doesn't have to be high-brow to make a worthy grilled cheese. "Land O' Lakes Yellow American all the way! For me, it's a nostalgic thing," says Young. "I grew up on Long Island and its the cheese of choice for a deli sandwich. For grilled cheese, it melts perfectly and doesn't taste fake like some of the other pre-packaged cheeses." Atler also goes basic. "Honestly, I always go for Kraft singles  I know, it's wrong but when I am feeling fancy I use Brillat-Savarin, with truffles," she says. Hopkins warns against using too much of a good thing. "It may sound funny, but too much cheese can ruin a grilled cheese," he says. "You can't lose sight of the importance of the crisp, chewy bread. Using too much fat can make it soggy and make you feel bad after eating one. Eating a grilled cheese should have you wanting more." Step three: Cook it right The way you cook a grilled cheese is as important as choosing the right ingredients. "Cardinal sins would be not melting the cheese enough and not toasting the bread enough. Who wants a grilled cheese with non-melted cheese or not properly grilled bread?" asks Lefebvre. As far as what to cook your sandwich in, most chefs pick a cast iron pan or a panini press."Non-stick skillets, cast iron pans and steel griddles work great," says Hopkins. "The panini press is good, though I don't always like a flat grilled cheese." Cook the grilled cheese over low heat to avoid burning the bread. "Make sure to grill it at a low heat, not too high," says Lefebvre. "You need to take time for your cheese to melt." Before you start cooking, grab some butter. "Start by using soft butter, spreading it directly on to the bread rather than putting the butter in the pan," says Marucci. "This will help golden the bread more evenly while it cooks." Hopkins agrees: "A key step is to butter or oil the bread first before it goes into the pan, that way you are ensured to have even toasting," says Hopkins. You'll end up using less fat, meaning less chance of a soggy sandwich. Lefebvre insists on using clarified butter (butter without milk solids, a.k.a. ghee) instead. "Clarified butter is a must. Baste your bread in the clarified butter before adding it to the heat," Lefebvre says. At Trois Mec, Lefebvre goes nuts and cooks grilled cheese on a wood fire. "That really adds a smoky flavor to it," he says. "Give it a try on your barbecue." Step four: Embellish You could stop at cheese and bread if you'd like, or add some extra ingredients for good measure. "You can add any garnish you want: bacon, tomato, jams, potato chips. But for me a good grilled cheese is just bread and cheese," says Lefebvre. Young adds a kick with hot sauce and pickled banana peppers. Atler goes for scallions and Siriracha. Hopkins is a fan of meaty grilled cheeses. "I like bacon grilled cheeses. I use very thinly shaved bacon and really crisp them up," he says. "Prosciutto grilled cheese with Fontina and ciabatta is also heavenly. If the Ciabatta is good and holey, then the cheese melts through hole and crisps up on the pan." The razzle dazzle can go down on the outside, too. "It's fun to lay some finely grated parmesan in the non-stick skillet and lay the already buttered bread into it," Hopkins says. "It creates a nice thin Parmesan tuile on the outside though you have to be real careful with the degree of heat because you still want to crust the bread underneath. Slow and low." Step five: Eat it If you want to go full high-low, pair your grilled cheese with something fancy. Lefebvre recommends finishing yours with "honeycomb or aged balsamic  also with a nice glass of champagne, like Krug."Hopkins agrees on the Krug front, recommending anything with bubbles. "It cuts the fat, cleanses the palate and refreshes: an ice cold sparkling water, Champagne or ice cold beer," he says. His pick for still wines are a crisp white Loire or a Provençal rosé.

BBMHokT	lifestyle	lifestylehoroscope	Leo Facts: 15 Of Them That You Definitely Didn't Know	These facts will blow you away!	These facts will blow you away! 1) Loyal Leo is one of the most loyal zodiac signs They place a lot of importance on this value. This strong sense of loyalty carries through to both friendships and relationships . But be warned: If you do wrong by this sign, you will struggle to regain their trust as they do not forget disloyalty easily. 2) Judges of character Leo understands people They are also particularly good judges of character; their tact and their powers of perception help them to read the hidden intentions of others with extreme accuracy. All they need is one look into your eyes to know if you have ulterior motives   well they do say that the eyes are the windows to the soul! 3) Tenacious Leo is brave As you most likely know, Leo is Latin for Lion, therefore it is no surprise that these natives are born with Lionhearts . In the face of adversity, they stand strong and never run away from issues in front of them, especially if it concerns someone close to them. The word "cowardice" doesn't exist in their dictionary! 4) Ferocious Leo can be spiky! If a Leo has decided that they that dislike someone, they are prone to show a nastier side to their personality . Never try to force these folks to get along with someone that they've already made up their mind about   any attempt you make will be futile. As mentioned before they're very good judges of character, so you might be better served listening to them anyways. 5) Caring Leo has a loving side On the other hand, they equally show limitless amounts of love towards those they deem worthy. They will always place the needs of those around them before their own needs, a quality indicative of their roles as natural-born leaders . However, make sure to acknowledge their efforts as they hate being taken for granted , though they probably won't show it. 6) Bossy Leo never bites their tongue Similarly, as the leaders of the pack , they are notorious for being particularly bossy   especially when it is about something which is close to their heart. Once they place importance on something, it has to be done their way or not all. Normally reserved, in situations such as this they become very vocal about what needs to be done. 7) Proud These natives have BIG egos Even though they are born to lead, Leos are typically not good at receiving criticism despite the fact that they might not express openly. As a result of their proud nature , the smallest critique can really affect them even if the criticism is for their benefit in the long run. Sometimes it helps to take a step back and not take everything personally. 8) Complex Leo hides their weaknesses While they come across as confident and assured on the exterior , they often struggle to express themselves when they're at their lowest points as they don't want to appear vulnerable in front of others. This often leads to feelings of isolation and loneliness harvesting within them, so make sure you share a heart to heart with them once every so often. 9) Loss Averse Their sense of attachment leads to their downfall Whilst they will readily give up on someone that they don't value, they struggle to let go of people and ideas in which they have invested a lot of time and love into. This can lead to them holding onto destructive people and tendencies in their life rather than letting go. 10) Depression Prone Leo is emotionally sensitive It is not uncommon for them to undergo brief periods of depression given the extreme nature of their emotions . The ruling planet is the Sun which we consider to be the heart of our solar system, therefore they are more prone to illness relating to the heart and the spine . That being said, they undoubtedly have the heart , tenacity, and hopefully support to bounce back from these periods. 11) Sociable Leo makes friends easily Whilst most would never admit it to themselves, people are naturally drawn to them due to their i nherent charisma and calming presence . The reserved way in which they outwardly exude confidence attracts people around them, even if the attention they garner is unwanted. While they may not see themselves in the same light, people naturally flock towards them as they're beacons of solidarity. 12) Compatibility Aries, Gemini and Sagittarius are their best matches When it comes to Leo compatibility with other zodiac signs, Leos are best suited to those who are fire signs like them such as Aries, Geminis, Librans and most notably Sagittarians. 13) Feeling Lucky? Leo's lucky numbers and colors are... Unsure what color jewelry to get for a Leo? Your best bet is to get them something in Gold, Orange, White or Red as these are a their lucky colors, as they all bear similarity to the flame which roars inside their lionhearts.

Reportedly called the ZR2 Bison, this rock-stomping performance variant will likely build on the capabilities of the standard Colorado ZR2 with its own suspension tuning and better approach and departure angles.

AABGZJn	news	newsus	A Chicago high school is spending $53,000 to reprint its yearbooks after several students flashed white supremacy symbols in their photos	The yearbooks contained 18 photos featuring students making an upside-down OK sign, which has recently been associated with white supremacist groups.	A high school in Chicago is spending $53,794 to reprint its 2018-19 yearbooks after school officials noticed photos of students making a hand gesture associated with white supremacist groups in the original copies. Oak Park River Forest High School, District 200, had previously halted distribution of yearbooks that contained "18 photos of clubs or teams in which students of various races, ethnicities, genders, and grades made a hand gesture - an upside-down OK sign," according to a letter from Superintendent Dr. Joylynn Pruitt-Adams seen by INSIDER. The upside-down OK sign circulated as hoax by 4chan users to falsely promote white supremacy in 2017, but in the last year, white supremacists have started using it as a symbol of white power, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) . Pruitt-Adams said the hand gesture is also associated with "the circle game," a prank in which one person makes a circle with their fingers and holds it below their waist, convincing a second person to look at it. If the second person looks, the first playfully punches them. Read more: An 11-year-old girl was sent to the principal's office after telling classmates to stop making the Nazi salute The superintendent said the photos in question were taken of clubs and teams in mid-October 2018, then approved and shipped to a printer in December 2018, "before the gesture was widely known to have any association with white nationalism." "I want to be clear that we are not making any presumptions about students' intent in using the gesture. Regardless of intent, however, there is a real and negative impact," Pruitt-Adams said. "Many students, not only our students of color, experience this gesture as a symbol of White supremacy. Potentially subjecting our students to this trauma is simply not acceptable." She said that Oak Park and River Forest High School wanted to be on the "leading edge" of addressing the issue and said the photos could "subject students to potentially a lifetime of questions or penalty from colleges, employers, etc." She said the district negotiated the initial cost of the reprint down to $53,794 from $85,000. According to the Chicago Sun-Times , the school initially printed 1,750 copies of the yearbook before deciding to remove the images. While the yearbooks are being reprinted, students will receive an eight-page autograph book that can be glued into the new yearbooks.

AAB1Mio	news	newsopinion	James Comey is in trouble and he knows it	Three internal investigations likely will fully expose Comey's mishandling of the FBI and legal processes.	Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. James Comey's planet is getting noticeably warmer. Attorney General William Barr's emissions are the suspected cause. Barr has made plain that he intends to examine carefully how and why Comey, as FBI director, decided that the bureau should investigate two presidential campaigns and if, in so doing, any rules or laws were broken. In light of this, the fired former FBI director apparently has decided that photos of him on Twitter standing amid tall trees and in the middle of empty country roads, acting all metaphysical, is no longer a sufficient strategy. No, Comey has realized, probably too late, that he has to try to counter, more directly, the narrative being set by the unsparing attorney general whose words in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week landed in the Trump-opposition world like holy water on Linda Blair. Shrieking heads haven't stopped spinning since. And so we've seen Comey get real busy lately. First he penned a curious op-ed in the New York Times. Then a Times reporter, with whom Comey has cooperated in the past, wrote a news article exposing an early, controversial investigative technique against the Trump campaign in an attempt to get out front and excuse it. Next, Comey is scheduled to be encouraged on a friendly cable news " town hall ." In the op-ed, Comey trotted out his now-familiar St. James schtick, freely pronouncing on the morality of others. He sees himself as a kind of Pontiff-of-the-Potomac working his beads, but comes across more like an unraveling Captain Queeg working his ball bearings. Comey adjudged the president as "amoral." He declared the attorney general to be "formidable" but "lacking inner strength" unlike - the inference is clear - Comey himself. A strategy of insulting the executioner right before he swings his ax is an odd one but, then, Comey has a long record of odd decisions and questionable judgment. "Amoral leaders (referring to the president) have a way of revealing the character of those around them," wrote Comey without a hint of irony or self-awareness. Those whom the former FBI director assembled around him probably rue the day they ever met the man. Most are now fired or disgraced for appalling behaviors that Comey found easy to manipulate to advance his decisions. Then, just to make sure his op-ed was odd-salted to the max, Comey mused that the president "eats your soul in small bites." Okay, let's step back for a moment: James Comey appears to be in trouble. His strange, desperate statements and behaviors betray his nervousness and apprehension. In a way, it's hard to watch. Comey will claim that everything he did in the FBI was by the book. But after the investigations by Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz and U.S. Attorney John Huber , along with AG Barr's promised examination, are completed, Comey's mishandling of the FBI and legal processes likely will be fully exposed. Ideally, Barr's examination will aggregate information that addresses three primary streams. The first will be whether the investigations into both presidential nominees and the Trump campaign were adequately, in Barr's words, "predicated." This means he will examine whether there was sufficient justification under existing guidelines for the FBI to have started an investigation in the first place. The Mueller report's conclusions make this a fair question for the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign. Comey's own pronouncement, that the Clinton email case was unprosecutable, makes it a fair question for that investigation. The second will be whether Comey's team obeyed long-established investigative guidelines while conducting the investigations and, specifically, if there was sufficient, truthful justification to lawfully conduct electronic surveillance of an American citizen. The third will be an examination of whether Comey was unduly influenced by political agendas emanating from the previous White House and its director of national intelligence, CIA director and attorney general. This, above all, is what's causing the 360-degree head-spins. There are early indicators that troubling behaviors may have occurred in all three scenarios. Barr will want to zero in on a particular area of concern: the use by the FBI of confidential human sources, whether its own or those offered up by the then-CIA director. Without diving into the weeds, it's important to understand that FBI counterintelligence investigations generally proceed sequentially from what is called a "preliminary investigation or inquiry" (PI) to a "full investigation" (FI). To move from a PI to an FI requires substantial information - predication - indicating investigative targets acted as agents of a foreign power. This is problematic for Comey in light of Mueller's findings. There are strict guidelines governing when the FBI can task a confidential source or a government undercover operative to collect against a U.S. citizen. Normally this is restricted to an FI, and normally restricted to the United States, not overseas. There is a sense that Comey's team was not checking the boxes, did not have adequate predication, and may have tasked sources before an investigation was even officially opened. Barr should pull case files and dig in on this. In addition, the cast of characters leveraged by the FBI against the Trump campaign all appear to have their genesis as CIA sources ("assets," in agency vernacular) shared at times with the FBI. From Stefan Halper and possibly Joseph Mifsud, to Christopher Steele, to Carter Page himself, and now a mysterious "government investigator" posing as Halper's assistant and cited in the New York Times article, legitimate questions arise as to whether Comey was manipulated into furthering a CIA political operation more than an FBI counterintelligence case. Some in the media have suggested that the Times article was an attempt by the FBI to justify its early confidential-source actions. But current FBI Director Christopher Wray has shown that he would like to excise the cancerous tumor that grew during Comey's time and not just keep smoking. It's hard to imagine current FBI executives trying to justify past malfeasance. James Comey is right to be apprehensive. He himself ate away at the soul of the FBI, not in small bites but in dangerously large ones. It was a dinner for one, though: His actions are not indicative of the real FBI. The AG's comprehensive examination is welcome and, if done honestly and dispassionately, it will protect future presidential candidates of both parties and redeem the valuable soul of the FBI. Kevin R. Brock, former assistant director of intelligence for the FBI, was an FBI special agent for 24 years and principal deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). He is a founder and principal of NewStreet Global Solutions , which consults with private companies and public-safety agencies on strategic mission technologies.

Kaia Gerber bares a striking resemblance to Rachel Bilson, plus more stars who look alike. Think your favorite celebrity is one in a million? Well, we hate to break it to you, but that's probably not the case. In celebration of National Lookalike Day on April 20, 2020, Wonderwall.com is taking a peek at some of our favorite stars and their famous doppelgängers... starting with these look-alikes! "The O.C." actress Rachel Bilson seems to have a mini-me -- none other than fashion model Kaia Gerber! Aside from their wavy brown locks, the two celebs share similar face shapes, eyes and lips. Keep reading to see more stars who bear an uncanny resemblance to one another... As everyone binged the second season of "You," many noticed that the actress Victoria Pedretti, who plays Love Quinn on the twisty show, shares some similarities with one of our other favorite small screen stars: Hilary Duff! It looks like Anne Hathaway has found a twin in human rights attorney Amal Clooney! The "Modern Love" actress responded to lookalike comparisons in an interview with "Extra" in 2015. "I've never heard that! Thank you," she told the reporter. "That's like so gonna be the best thing to happen to me today." Cute! "I hope that I become half the woman she is," Anne continued. "She's so accomplished and it's so thrilling to look at someone and be like, 'Wow. You really are making the world a better place.'" From their eyes to their smiles to their face shapes, actresses Kathryn Hahn and Ana Gasteyer are spitting images of one another. "Every single day I probably get a compliment for her, and every single day she gets a compliment for me," Ana told People magazine in 2019. In the same interview, she said she once met music star Kenny G, who thought she was Kathryn! Ana, however, didn't have the heart to tell the musician the truth. "It's like correcting someone on your name, you just don't want to make them feel bad for being excited," she said. Robby Hayes has popped up on several "The Bachelor" franchises from JoJo Fletcher's season of "The Bachelorette" to "Bachelor in Paradise," plus he more recently can be seen on MTV's "Siesta Key." But did you ever notice that he looks a lot like a certain comedic actor? The reality star shares features with Will Forte. Though there are nearly 20 years between the two, fans have noticed an uncanny resemblance between "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Kyle Richards and country crooner Kacey Musgraves. Jon Snow might know nothing, but we know that he has a look-alike in another HBO actor: Christopher Abbott. The "Girls" alum is a dead-ringer for "Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington with his dark, wavy hair, widow's peak, signature stubble, pillowy lips and brooding stare. In June 2019, beloved gay pop icon Boy George opened up about a movie about his life that's in the works at MGM. As for who might play him? "There's been some really interesting suggestions," the Culture Club frontman told Australian radio station Nova's "Fitzy and Wippa" show. "One of the most interesting suggestions was ['Game of Thrones' actress] Sophie Turner. [People will say,] 'She can't play you she's a woman,' you know. But when I was 17, I would have loved to have been her." Sophie, meanwhile sees the resemblance too: "I'm SO down!" she tweeted. If you wondered "where have I seen him before?" while watching breakout star David Corenswet as River on the Netflix series "The Politician," it's probably because with his piercing blue eyes and chiseled jaw, he's a dead ringer for a young Henry Cavill! OK, so there might be a 29-year age gap between these two, but hear us out! Italian-French model and singer Carla Bruni Sarkozy and supermodel Bella Hadid could be mother and daughter! Both dark-haired beauties look so similar that upon meeting at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, Carla shared a picture of the two on Instagram alongside the caption, "Do I have a hidden daughter?" If only he had blue-green eyes and a scar on his eyebrow, "Prometheus" star Logan Marshall-Green would look exactly like Tom Hardy. Though there's a 13-year age gap between them, Miranda Kerr's baby face looks very similar to actress-singer Dove Cameron's! The supermodel and the Disney star share a similar eye shape, nose and pout. Not shown: Their identicle dimples! The brown coifs... the scruffy stubble... the handsome good looks... is there anything Richard Madden and Gus Kenworthy don't share?! The "Bodyguard" actor and the Olympic medal-winning freestyle skier could definitely pass as brothers! Lucy Hale and Sarah Hyland are true doppelgängers. In fact, the two actresses look so much alike that Lucy herself said they could past for sisters. The "Pretty Little Liars" star posted this selfie on Instagram in 2018 with the caption, "Anyone tryin to cast some sisters?" Who knew these two looked so similar? Haylie Duff and former reality TV star Danielle Jonas, who's married to music star Kevin Jonas, are another pair of celebrities who look like twins. Aside from their different hair colors, these stars look identical. Ever watched Bravo's "Southern Charm" and wondered who Kathryn Dennis reminded you of? Well, we here at Wonderwall.com figured it out -- a young Emma Stone! The fiery redheaded reality star shares many facial similarities with the A-list actress in addition to having the same hair color. "The Girl on the Train" star Haley Bennett is a dead ringer for Jennifer Lawrence. She and J.Law could be sisters! Looks like "The Property Brothers" could add a triplet to the mix! Twins Jonathan and Drew Scott have always been told they have a celebrity look-alike, and it's none other than Harry Connick Jr.! Harry even had them stop by his show in December 2016 where the brothers posed for a fake family Christmas photo. "Slow Hands" hitmaker Niall Horan and "Downton Abbey" actor Allen Leech could be brothers! In September 2019, the actor dropped by "The Late Late Show with James Corden" and talked about the comparison. "Listen, it's very flattering to me. I'm 38, he's 26," Allen told James. From their hair color to their face shapes to their eyes -- these two Irishmen look incredibly similar. Bryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain have more in common than copper locks. The classic beauties also share similar eyebrow shapes, striking blue eyes and high cheekbones. A-list comedian Will Ferrell and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith are both kind of a big deal. An even bigger deal is the fact that they could pass for twins. Nicholas Hoult looks exactly like his "Kill Your Friends" co-star Ed Skrein, don't you think? Seriously, the resemblance is crazy! Someone sign up Zoe Saldana and Jada Pinkett Smith to play sisters, stat! "Who's that new girl?" No, it's not Jess. It's actually Katy Perry and Zooey Deschanel. (Duh!) Jamie Dornan should be first in line for the lead role if there's ever a biopic about Sweden's Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland. Though you might not immediately think of Jaime Pressly while looking at Margot Robbie, when side by side, it's clear the actresses share some striking similarities! The blondes have a similar face shape, eyes and lips. If he gained about 60 pounds of muscle, former reality TV star Derrick Dillard of "19 Kids and Counting" and "Counting On" fame would be a dead ringer for NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers. No, that's not a pre-fame Carrie Underwood on the right. That's her mini-me, Emily Osment. Someone call a doctor because we're totally seeing double! Javier Bardem and Jeffrey Dean Morgan have been causing confusion for years. Antoni Porowski and John Mayer looks like brothers! The "Queer Eye" star and the musician have the same brunette locks, chiseled chins and distinct noses. Antoni even poked fun at their resemblance on social media, re-posting side-by-side black-and-white photos on his Instagram Story, as captured by People magazine. "Riverdale" fans set Twitter ablaze after realizing star Lili Reinhart bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Brittany Murphy. Though the ladies have different eye colors, their face shape, as well as their noses and mouths, are pretty much identical. The resemblance between Patrick Wilson and funnyman Will Arnett is no joke. Actress-director Elizabeth Banks and "Modern Family" alum Julie Bowen share more than just their blonde updos -- the celebrities share similar face shapes, eyes and smiles! We're shocked Hollywood hasn't tapped Amanda Peet and Lake Bell to play sisters yet! The two actresses might have different eye colors, but their hair and facial features are super-similar. Which is Helena Christensen and which is a brunette Cameron Diaz circa 2007? Can you say sisters? Actresses Courteney Cox and Demi Moore look like twins in this picture. In 2019, Demi shared the 2016 pic on Instagram with the caption, "Who's who 👯‍♀️." From their dark, long locks to their thick-rimmed black specs, these two made us do a double take. Both Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliffe have starred in iconic franchises, but the actors have even more in common -- they look like brothers! Seriously, take a look at their face shapes, eyes, ears, noses and mouths! It makes us wonder how we never noticed this before! We wonder if Larisa Oleynik -- whom you might remember as the titular heroine of Nickelodeon's "The Secret World of Alex Mack" -- ever gets mistaken for Carey Mulligan. There's no doubt that someone once used the expression "a Jennifer Aniston type" to describe a young Jennifer Lawrence before she was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. They're both funny guys, and the similarities don't end there! In April 2018, Zach Braff realized just how much he and pal Dax Shepard look alike and tweeted a photo of the duo after using the FaceSwap tool -- which resulted in a nearly identical pic! Though you wouldn't immediately realize it, Tiffany Thiessen and Alexandra Daddario have a very similar look! The "Saved By the Bell" alum and the "Baywatch" beauty not only have very similar coloring but the same striking light eyes and a similar mouth. Hazel-eyed hotties Mila Kunis and Sarah Hyland share more than the same eye color. Just look at them! These two actresses' personalities couldn't be more different, but when you put Mila Kunis and Vanessa Hudgens next to each other, they seem awfully similar, doncha think? Ashton Kutcher's wife, Mila Kunis, had to get a side-by-side comparison of her husband and equally hunky "Bachelor in Paradise" contestant Jared Haibon. "I'm trying to figure out why mila is making me take this picture @ashleyiaco who are you? And who is this guy?" Kutcher wrote on Twitter in 2015 when he shared the snapshot. But "BiP" contestant Ashley Iaconetti (who's now dating Jared) was the first to notice their similarly chiseled cheekbones and jaws. On the show, she said Jared looked like a mix between Ashton and Joe Jonas. Hollywood took notice of this pair of lookalikes and cast them as mother and daughter on "Once Upon a Time," but it still blows our mind just how similar Ginnifer Goodwin and Jennifer Morrison look! They're almost like twins in an alternate universe -- with the same name (spelled differently) and different hair colors! We never realized how much Row Lowe and Ian Somerhalder looked alike! A younger Rob, pictured here in 2004, looks a whole lot like the "Vampire Diaries" stud -- both share the piercing blue eyes that contrast with their dark hair and both have an amazingly impressive jawline! Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the sexiest of them all? Good luck choosing between Ian Somerhalder and Chace Crawford. These hotties with baby blues are practically identical! Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman share more than just acting talent! While on "The Late Late Show with James Corden" in 2018, "Love Actually" actress Keira dished on her celebrity look-alikes. "Well, I've been chased through an airport as Natalie Portman," she said. "I mean, [I get] Natalie Portman a lot." From their eyes to their face shapes, the resemblance is uncanny. These two have to be related! Sienna Miller's doppelgänger is fellow British celebrity Mollie King! Mollie, a member of music group The Saturdays, is six years younger than Sienna, but the two could easily pass for twins with their megawatt matching smiles. Even Victoria Justice has acknowledged that she and Nina Dobrev look alike. Twin alert: Considering the shape of their brows, noses and lips, Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester could be twins. Oh, what fun they could've had tricking their respective boyfriends as teens -- if only they were actually related. Are we seeing double? Both of these hunks have starred on popular, binge-worthy shows, and though they weren't on the same network, they look like they came straight out of the same family! "Lost" star Josh Holloway and "Game of Thrones" star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau both are known to sport the same sexy stubble and have the same piercing light eyes. "Girls" alum Allison Williams and "13 Going on 30" actress Christa B. Allen could certainly pass for sisters if not doppelgängers! The brunettes share similar face shapes, lips, noses and jawlines. Leelee Sobieski has been compared to a young Helen Hunt throughout her career. Alicia Silverstone has a celebrity doppelgänger in Hollywood -- "Psych" actress Maggie Lawson! There's a four-year age difference between the actresses, but the blondes share very similar eyes, eyebrows and mouth shapes. One-time "The Bachelorette" star JoJo Fletcher found love on Season 12 of the show, and we found ourselves wondering which celebrity she reminded us of! The answer? Isla Fisher! Both beauties have almost the same eyes and smile! We used to get Amy Adams and Isla Fisher confused on the regular before they became two of Hollywood's hottest stars. Since the beginning of Harry Styles's career he's been told he could pass for Mick Jagger -- though it remains to be seen whether the former One Direction singer's career can have that kind of longevity! We never noticed it before, but with bangs, Jessica Biel and Carly Rae Jepsen look totally alike! Spot the difference? Eva Mendes' mole is just a little higher than Cindy Crawford's. Other than that, these two stars look practically the same! Eva Mendes doesn't just look like only one super-famous model! Aside from the Cindy Crawford comparisons, Eva also shares a likeness with Ashley Graham! Can you see it? Lea Michele and Idina Menzel don't just share backgrounds on Broadway and killer singing skills. They also share facial features. The "Frozen" actress even played the mother of Lea's "Glee" alter ego! Some might say Naya Rivera and Kim Kardashian West look a bit similar. Others might say the "Glee" actress has actively copied the reality TV star's look. Hunky Brit Henry Cavill has a French doppelgänger just four years his junior! "Outlander" actor Stanley Weber is a dead ringer for the "Man of Steel" stunner, oui? Another set of celeb lookalikes you've got to see to believe? Blake Lively and Kesha! The two definitely have something in common aside from their blonde locks! We think it's all in the eyes for these two! With their big beautiful smiles and warm brown eyes, Jordin Sparks and America Ferrera bear an uncanny resemblance to one another. We don't really see it, but "Harry Potter" actor Rupert Grint and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran are constantly compared looks-wise. While on "The Late Late Show with James Corden" in 2017, Rupert admitted how he is often mistaken for his fellow redhead and Englishman. "If someone stops me, it could go either way -- I could be Ed or I could be me," he said. Their noses are different -- and that's about the only thing that sets former Disney stars Garrett Clayton and Zac Efron apart. Reality stars separated at birth! Cheryl Burke of "Dancing With the Stars" fame looks a lot like "The Real Housewives of Orange County" star Kelly Dodd! Both ladies have nearly identical smiles -- and the same killer cheekbones! These two actors are close pals in real life, but we wonder if they've ever realized how similar they look! Liam Neeson has 10 years on buddy Ralph Fiennes, but their eyes are so similar that it's hard to tell. Once upon a time, Lindsay Lohan was a frontrunner to play Victoria Gotti in a biopic. And that's because they are one and the same -- in so many ways. You gotta admit that Khloe Kardashian was once the spitting image of late wrestler Chyna... They were once inseparable besties -- even sharing a cover of Vogue in March 2015 -- so it's not a huge surprise that Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss even started to look alike. Both tall blondes once rocked short platinum hair, which showed off their similar cheekbones, noses and mouths. There's no denying the two have a very similar look, even if they're mysteriously no longer BFFs. The angular jaw... the facial hair... the dark, wavy hair... the similarities are endless. "The Disaster Artist" actor James Franco and "Insurgent" star Theo James could be brothers!
BBVQVOk	sports	baseball_mlb	Jackie Robinson: A remarkable life in 42 photos	Major League Baseball celebrates Jackie Robinson Day on April 15 every season. Robinson, of course, broke the color barrier in MLB and had a Hall of Fame career with the Dodgers, and he did it all with the class and style most can only dream of, particularly under the circumstances.	Major League Baseball celebrates Jackie Robinson Day on April 15 every season. Robinson, of course, broke the color barrier in MLB and had a Hall of Fame career with the Dodgers, and he did it all with the class and style most can only dream of, particularly under the circumstances. Major League Baseball celebrates Jackie Robinson Day on April 15 every season. Robinson, of course, broke the color barrier in MLB and had a Hall of Fame career with the Dodgers, and he did it all with the class and style most can only dream of, particularly under the circumstances. Here, we honor Robinson with Jackie Robinson's life as told for 42 photos for No. 42. Early years Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born Jan. 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia. Early years Jackie (second from the left) was the youngest of five brothers and sisters. Robinson's stay in Georgia was short-lived, as he moved with mother and siblings to California shortly after his father left in 1920. UCLA Robinson became a four-sport star at UCLA, earning varsity letters in baseball, football, basketball and track and field. UCLA Robinson won the 1940 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships in the long jump. Surprisingly, in addition to playing football and basketball, he played just one season of baseball at UCLA, hitting only .097, not the start you'd expect to lead to a Hall of Fame MLB career. Military career Robinson was drafted in 1942 and served until 1944 when he received an honorable discharge after an incident where he refused to sit in the back of a military bus. He never actually saw any combat. Negro Leagues Robinson signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, and it was here where he drew the attention of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey. Marriage to Rachel Isum Robinson married his college sweetheart in February 1946. Fatherhood The couple welcomed its first child to the world later that year. Signing with the Dodgers Late in 1945 Robinson signed his historic deal with the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the way for him to become the first black player in Major League Baseball. Minor leagues Robinson spent 1946 in Montreal playing for the Royals, the AAA affiliate of the Dodgers. The call-up Just prior to the start of the 1947 season, Robinson gets the call from the Dodgers to come and join the big league club. Number 42 He is assigned No. 42, which would go on to become arguably the most iconic jersey number in MLB history. Meeting Leo Durocher The Dodgers manager at the time was the legendary Leo Durocher, who was an outspoken champion for Robinson breaking the MLB color barrier. Debut with the Dodgers Robinson makes his MLB debut on April 15, 1947, drawing a walk and scoring a run in a 5-3 win. Life on the Dodgers While not everyone on the Dodgers was excited to have Robinson on the team, most of his new teammates followed their manager's lead and welcomed him with open arms. Rookie of the Year Robinson's first year was an unmitigated success, where he hit just under .300 while leading the league in stolen bases on his way to his first World Series. For his efforts, he was named Rookie of the Year. Friendship with Pee Wee Reese One teammate in particular who came out in strong support of Robinson was Pee Wee Reese, who memorably once put his arm around Robinson, a gesture that was later memorialized as a statue in Brooklyn. All-Star Jackie Robinson was the first black player to make the All-Star team in 1949, and he made it five more times in each of the next five seasons. Facing racism throughout his career Robinson's trials and tribulations while dealing with racism on and off the field are well-documented, but perhaps no one was as outspoken as Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who often hurled racial epithets at Robinson from the Philadelphia dugout. Civil rights advocate Long before his career ended, Robinson used his newfound fame to become a champion of civil rights across the United States. "The Jackie Robinson Story" In the middle of his run with the Dodgers, Robinson starred in his own biopic in 1950, opposite Ruby Dee. Family life Mr. and Mrs. Robinson ended up with a total of three kids: Jackie Jr., Sharon and David. NBC Robinson took a role at NBC in 1952, which would later lead to him breaking into broadcasting following his retirement from baseball. Relationship with Larry Doby A few months after Robinson's debut, Larry Doby broke the color barrier in the American League, and the two quickly became close friends. National League MVP Robinson's best year as a Dodger came in 1949 when he led the league in batting average and steals while also scoring 122 runs and knocking in 124 runs on his way to his one and only NL MVP award. Taking on the Yankees in the World Series The Dodgers made it to the World Series a remarkable six times during Jackie Robinson's tenure there but were bested by the Yankees during five of those trips. World Champion In 1955, the Dodgers finally got over the hump and defeated their crosstown adversary, giving Robinson his only World Series ring. World Series victory While the title would make the Dodgers the toast of the city, the celebration would be short-lived, as they would move to Los Angeles in 1957, one year after Robinson retired. Political activist Robinson was all over the political spectrum, supporting candidates like Hubert Humphrey... Political activist … to Nelson Rockefeller... Political activist ... to meeting Fidel Castro... Political activist ... and even supporting Richard Nixon's presidential candidacy. Civil rights advocate Robinson spent the late 1950s and early part of the 1960s fighting for civil rights... Civil rights advocate ... including in this photo with boxer Floyd Patterson before the two boarded a flight to Birmingham. Trade to the Giants A little-remembered fact about Robinson is that the Dodgers actually traded him to the Giants following the 1956 season. However... Retirement ... he never suited up for them, instead announcing his retirement from professional baseball at the age of 37. Chock Full O'Nuts Upon retirement, Robinson became president of the Chock Full O' Nuts company. Election to the Hall of Fame Robinson was elected to Cooperstown in 1962, his first year of eligibility on the ballot. He broke down another color barrier, becoming the first African-American to be given baseball's highest honor. Broadcast career In the late '60s Robinson did broadcast work for both ABC and the Montreal Expos, the city where his professional career began. Football general manager In 1966, Robinson became general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers...of the Continental Football League, a pro football league that existed from 1965 to 1969. Death Jackie Robinson died on Oct. 24, 1972, from a heart attack at the age of 53. Nearly 3,000 people attended his funeral. Legacy On April 15, 1997, Jackie Robinson became the first athlete to have his number retired league-wide. To this day, every player in the league sports No. 42 on April 15 as a tribute to the iconic Robinson.

BBMVoOL	movies	movies-celebrity	Asia Argento Claims She Was Victim in Jimmy Bennett Sexual Encounter	Asia Argento's new attorney, Mark Jay Heller   whose previous clients have included Lindsay Lohan and "Son of Sam" serial killer David Berkowitz   has hit back at the sexual assault allegation made by her former co-star, Jimmy Bennett.	Asia Argento 's new attorney, Mark Jay Heller   whose previous clients have included Lindsay Lohan and "Son of Sam" serial killer David Berkowitz   has hit back at the sexual assault allegation made by her former co-star, Jimmy Bennett. Yesterday, Heller released a 1,400-word statement on behalf of the Italian actress which acknowledged that there was a "sexual attack" involving Argento and Bennett in 2013   only he's saying that she was not the perpetrator, but the victim. In August, the New York Times reported that Argento had arranged for Bennett to be paid $380,000 in order to ward off a potential lawsuit over his claim that Argento gave him alcohol and had sex with him in May 2013, when he was 17 and a minor according to California law. According to the Times, Bennett's attorneys initially contacted the longtime lawyer for the late Anthony Bourdain , Argento's boyfriend at the time, who tragically killed himself in June. Heller's statement claims Bourdain "chose" to foot the costs of the settlement "to protect Asia's and his reputation," which was "vulnerable to embarrassment" because the couple were "early and prominent supporters of the #MeToo movement." Now, in this statement, Argento's lawyer claims she did not initiate the encounter. Instead, she says, she became "frozen" when Bennett allegedly got on top of her, and that she "chose at the time not to prosecute." The statement also goes on to explain that Argento "will not permit any portion of the balance" left from the settlement agreement between her and Bennett to be paid "for this falsely alleged incident." Last fall, Argento was one of the first women to come forward with accusations of sexual assault and harassment against powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, which launched the #MeToo movement. Argento and Bourdain were both vocal in their support for other survivors, so the revelation that Bourdain helped Argento facilitate a "financial payout" that would effectively, if not legally, silence an accusation against Argento was shocking and disappointing. Argento initially denied having had any sexual contact with Bennett, but late last month, model Rain Dove, who has been romantically involved with Argento's fellow Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, provided the NYPD with text messages allegedly from Argento in which she admitted, "I had sex with him it felt weird." "When it became apparent that they were not going to allow for justice to occur or for the truth to be on the table, I knew I had no choice but to go forward because otherwise I would be complicit and I would be robbing another individual of their ability to be heard in their story," Dove told Today last month. While McGowan had initially defended Argento, she has since stated that she felt "betrayed" by her now former friend. In late August, McGowan released a lengthy statement expressing her support for Dove's actions and explaining why she was severing ties with her "ride or die." "Asia you were my friend," McGowan wrote. "I loved you. You've spent and risked a lot to stand with the MeToo movement. I really hope you find your way through this process to rehabilitation and betterment. … Do the right thing. Be honest. Be fair. Let justice stay its course. Be the person you wish Harvey could have been."Bourdain's side of the story may never be fully known, as he died well before the Times story broke. But the new statement from Heller implies that Bennett's initial lawsuit threat was motivated by him learning that Argento was in a romantic relationship with someone he believed to be "wealthy." Argento had been "completely against" the settlement, the statement reads, because "she had done nothing wrong"; however, she respected Bourdain's "choice to avoid the potential intrusion into their relationship and the negative impact it might have," according to the statement, specifically on Bourdain and his "high profile position" in media. The statement is framed as an announcement of sorts for Argento's launch of "Phase 2" of the #MeToo movement, which "dictates that the voice of a victim, even one with a history that may be in question, should be heard." It goes on to express hope that Argento will be cleared in the court of public opinion of initiating sex with a minor. It also argues once again that she was the victim of a sexual attack and "might even be suffering the fallback of a smear campaign." Yet the statement makes new and potentially damaging allegations about Bennett, claiming that in 2014, Bennett was charged by the Los Angeles Police Department with "unlawful sex with a minor," "stalking," "child pornography" and "child exploitation," for an alleged incident in which the complainant said Heller requested nude photos and "had a history of drug abuse." Rolling Stone has been unable to locate any prior reporting about this alleged incident, and the statement itself does not include any additional details that could expedite the process of corroborating the allegation. Rolling Stone 's efforts to reach both Mark Jay Heller and Bennett's attorney, Gordon K. Sattro, have thus far been unsuccessful.

BBORW98	autos	autossuvs	2019 Lincoln MKC 2.3 First Drive: Driving Lincoln's Entry-Level Crossover	Still searching for ways to stand out	The Lincoln MKC 's best feature is easy to miss: unusually wide liftgate cutlines swing around either side of taillights that stretch from one corner to another, increasing the compact crossover's perceived width. It's a standout design detail, but the MKC needs more than a fancy Audi -esque liftgate to thrive in an entry-luxury segment that's matured considerably since the Lincoln arrived for 2015. With the MKC fresh from a light update for 2019, we drove the crossover to determine how relevant Lincoln's least expensive car remains. With conventional SUV looks, the Lincoln starts strong. If that sounds silly, consider the Mercedes-Benz GLA and Infiniti QX30 , crossovers that resemble hatchbacks as much as SUVs. True, both of those luxury crossovers are smaller than the MKC, but the Lincoln's pricing spans from an affordable $34,920 to more than $55,000 like our loaded Black Label tester, leaving room for many different luxury crossover options. If you tend to shop by price as much as size, the Ford Escape -based crossover's prime competition includes the comparison-winning Volvo XC40 , BMW X1 , and that GLA all of which carry starting prices just under $35,000. It's a diverse group, yet we've tested all-wheel-drive versions of all three that outrun the MKC 2.0 while also delivering greater fuel efficiency. Hmm. Despite that curiosity, lead-footed drivers should still consider the front- or all-wheel-drive 245-hp 2.0-liter turbo-four base engine as much as the 285-hp 2.3-liter unit that requires all-wheel drive. Go for the latter option, and your $45,100 MKC 2.3 AWD's respectable 6.5-second 0-60 time keeps up with the Infiniti QX50 and Acura RDX . Still, that comes at the cost of 18/25 mpg fuel economy and a relatively short overall driving range, meaning you'll spend a bit more time stopping to refuel. With both engines, know that although the EPA uses regular gas in its tests, Lincoln manages 245- and 285-hp ratings with 93-octane fuel. Numbers aside, the 2019 MKC drives adequately, but the six-speed transmission still feels lazy just like a 2015 MKC 2.3 we drove years ago. A few times during my week with the 2019 MKC 2.3, I was left wishing for quicker transmission responsiveness. As I traversed city streets and Southern California highways, I also began to question our Black Label model's gorgeous extra-cost 20-inch wheels. Paired with our test-crossover's Rhapsody Blue paint and complemented by the new and richly detailed grille, the 2019 MKC will hold its own at a high-end hotel's valet station. But as soon as you drive across less-than-perfect road surfaces in any drive mode, the stiffer ride may make you question that style-first wheel choice. Inside, the cabin meets expectations for a compact luxury crossover that will mostly sell between $35,000 and $50,000. The transmission-shift buttons on the left side of the center console are unique in this segment, and even though the colorful instrument cluster screens will be familiar to anyone who's driven a Ford lately, it's still a cool touch. MKC Black Labels use upgraded materials well beyond most Fords, however, including an Alcantara headliner and floormats lined with the same material. That helps justify the higher price, but our crossover's $55,730 as-tested price is too much for a Lincoln with a back seat that feels as cozy as this one does. At least the outboard headrests fold down when not in use to maximize rear visibility. As with other Black Label Lincolns, the MKC Black Label gets free detailing for the first four years of ownership, complimentary maintenance for four years/50,000 miles, and Lincoln will even take you and your significant other out to dinner. That's thanks to the Culinary Collection, which connects owners with restaurants at which chefs offer a curated dining experience (the free dinner occurs the first time you use the service). It sounds lovely, but in the mid-$50,000 range I'd consider the next-size-up Nautilus crossover. Plus, you don't need Black Label to feel special as a Lincoln owner. The automaker's Pickup & Delivery service is a frill almost no other luxury brand matches in this price range. After calling a dealer or using an app to schedule service and a pickup, a brand representative will retrieve your car as long as it's within 20 miles of a dealer, or 50 miles for Black Label owners and get it serviced while you drive a loaner car. Once your car is ready, it's delivered back to you, ready to go. Neat. Being more frugal with options and avoiding the tempting 2.3-liter engine upgrade takes the MKC to safer ground. Try a $41,550 Reserve model, which includes leather seats (heated and ventilated in front), a power tilt/telescoping steering column (also on the lower Select), a panoramic sunroof, and a blind-spot monitoring system. Lincoln now offers automatic emergency braking on the MKC, but it's bundled with other tech that's optional, not standard, on the Reserve trim. One feature in that package is adaptive cruise control, which won't function in stop-and-go traffic, eliminating one of the best reasons to get that tech . Although every automaker needs to keep prices competitive, we'd like to see blind-spot monitoring standard on the base or Select model, with automatic emergency braking standard at least on Reserve, if not the lower Select model. The MKC hasn't been fully safety tested by the IIHS, but the NHTSA gives it a four-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). That's acceptable but not ideal, and the same is true of brake pedal placement. I found it too upright and positioned too far forward though your mileage may vary. But it likely won't for the touchscreen infotainment system, which is easy to use but mounted too low on the center stack for optimum visibility. Hopefully, the next-gen model will improve all of these minor issues. Until then, the competent 2019 Lincoln MKC still doesn't solidly distinguish itself above its many competitors, aside from Pickup & Delivery and solid rear styling.

Detailed Findings All of the 40 dog breeds with the shortest life expectancies live on average just under 10-years -- more than two years less than the average lifespan for all dogs. On the other hand, the average life expectancy of the breeds on the longest-living dogs list is 14.3 years -- two years longer than the average lifespan. Researchers have found that the larger the dog, the shorter the lifespan, though reasons for this remain unclear. In an article published in the scientific journal "The American Naturalist" in April 2013, "The Size-Life Span Trade-off Decomposed: Why Large Dogs Die Young," researchers did not find a clear correlation between body size and the onset of senescence, the process of deterioration with age. "We conclude that large dogs die young mainly because they age quickly," the study said. The research team led by evolutionary biologist Cornelia Kraus of the University of Gottingen in Germany said there is evidence that growing large rapidly and maintaining a large body size might come at the expense of reduced survival. Historically, larger dogs had been bred to be working dogs and used to hunt bigger animals, pull wagons, or tug fishing nets in cold water. Because of this kind of work, these dogs developed larger and muscular bodies. The need for these bigger dogs to do this work has diminished, but their physical characteristics remain. These larger dogs need physical exertion to keep them healthy. The study in "The American Naturalist" also said research showed deaths due to neoplastic processes -- the uncontrolled growth of cells not under physiologic control -- tend to be more common in large dogs than smaller canines. There are other factors that affect the lifespan of dogs. Inbreeding can reduce their longevity because inbred dogs can pass along genes that contain illnesses specific to that breed. Crossbred dogs have greater longevity. Also, spaying or neutering your canine is believed to benefit the animal's longer-term health. According to the Humane Society, spaying or neutering dogs reduces their risk of getting certain types of cancers. Methodology To identify the dog breeds with the longest (and shortest) life expectancy, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from Paul Jones et al's 2008 study "Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism-Based Association Mapping of Dog Stereotypes." This research analyzed the DNA of 148 domestic dog breeds and included various attributes like size, temperament, trainability, and average age at death. The longevity data primarily represents owner surveys. Supplemental data was retrieved from the American Kennel Club (AKC). Additional information was provided by CanineJournal.com. Only dog breeds that are recognized by the AKC were considered.

Nearly 50 attractions along the way vary in price from free to pretty affordable, but the classic ride itself doesn't cost a thing except for gas. Oregon: Forest Park Before hipsters and craft beer became the state's major trend, Oregon was defined by the natural majesty of huge trees and ocean mists. At Forest Park, which dubs itself "America's premier urban forest," you can get a 5,157-acre slice of that majesty, including 80 miles of soft-surface trails, mountain views, and guided hikes, all within the city limits of Portland. Pennsylvania: The Liberty Bell Even in 2019, some of the most significant relics of American history are still free. At the Liberty Bell Center, located at the intersection of Philadelphia's 6th and Market streets, you'll get the world's closest view of the Liberty Bell, complete with Independence Hall in the background. Before you observe the relic, check out a 10-minute presentation about the bell to get hyped on history. Read: 20 American Tourist Traps That Are Actually Worth the Money Rhode Island: Providence Children's Museum So kids can exercise while they learn, PCM focuses on playful, interactive exhibits like the swirling Water Ways, an outdoor native plant garden, a maze-like climbing puzzle and the underground tunnels of Underland. Get your free tickets during promotions like MetLife Family Friday or get in free with a Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island card   health insurance cardholders receive one free admission per card with ID. South Carolina: Old Sheldon Ruins Sheldon Church Ruins might be quaint compared to more flashy tourist traps , but this Beaufort County attraction is unforgettable. Constructed in the mid-1700s, these haunting ruins were an attempt to mimic the style of a Greek temple   right in the mossy woods of South Carolina. Bring your camera as you explore the dilapidated portico columns and Palladian windows before studying the historical names written on Old Sheldon's marble sarcophagi. South Dakota: Mount Rushmore Mount Rushmore is one of the most quintessential tourist attractions in the country   and it's free. You know that you'll be seeing the huge, carved faces of past presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, but throughout the year, activities ranging from Lakota dance celebrations to plays at the amphitheater are free, too. Admission, not parking, is free. Tennessee: Tennessee State Museum The Tennessee State Museum's array of permanent exhibits and traveling installations focuses squarely on frontier history, with hundreds of pieces exploring everything from the first Tennesseans to the Age of Jackson to the Antebellum era. Take in this slice of the South for free   admission includes access to the Military Museum branch   and you can pop on over to the State Capitol for a guided tour, too. Texas: Gruene Hall You might have heard the expression, "dance like no one's watching," but if you're at the oldest dance hall in Texas, you can very often dance like no one's paying. At Gruene Hall in New Braunfels, Texas, snacks, and drinks come at a cost, but you can find a handful of weekly shows for free. So dance your heart out like it's 1878, the year Gruene Hall was built. Utah: Utah Olympic Park Utah's Olympic Winter Games hosting gig ended in 2002, but it left behind 400 acres of awesome free outdoor activities just outside of Salt Lake City. Day passes for some areas and activities range from about $12 to $300, but the Alf Engen Ski Museum, 2002 Winter Olympic Games Museum, Discovery Zone, hiking trails and Mountain Challenge are all free of charge. Vermont: Museum of the Creative Process The Museum of the Creative Process calls itself, "a center of creative discovery, innovative research, and intellectual retreat." This haven for creatives not only houses artistic and scientific exhibits, but it also features an emotional education program based on 30 years of clinical research. Open your mind to sculpture, art and a deeper emotional understanding   all for free. Virginia: Maymont James and Sallie Dooley left 100 acres of gardens, mansions, goats and sea otters as a gift to all Virginians, and now that gift is yours, too. Admission to the grounds and gardens is free, and the wildlife exhibits and mansion tours operate on suggested donations. Washington: Kubota Garden Seattle might be the home of grunge, but Kubota Garden is anything but grungy. Landscaped by Fujitaro Kubota, these 20 peaceful acres combine Northwest flora with traditional Japanese garden designs. Beautiful bridges and paths gently guide you through rock outcroppings, streams, ponds and waterfalls, where you can meditate on all the money you're not spending. West Virginia: Blenko Glass Company Sure, you can purchase Blenko Glass Company's gorgeously delicate, handcrafted creations online or at the brick-and-mortar store, but it might be the creative process that leaves the biggest impression. Established in 1893, Blenko still employs many traditional glass-making techniques you can see in action for free   glass-blowing demonstrations are the highlight   and you'll see the whole process as you venture through a fully functioning, glass-making production facility. Wisconsin: Jelly Belly Warehouse Tour In Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, free candy makes your trip even more pleasant. Every day, the Jelly Belly Visitor Center and the Jelly Belly Express Train Tour whisk visitors through a free, 25-minute ride that explores production process of treats like candy corn, gummies, and, of course, jelly beans. The tour includes free samples and   seriously   a chorus line of giant dancing jelly beans. Saving money is sweet, but jelly beans, especially dancing ones, are even sweeter. Wyoming: Castle Gardens Think of Wyoming and you probably envision stunning, otherworldly rocks that are the color of a summer sunset. That's what Castle Gardens is all about, with its hundreds of prehistoric carvings   petroglyphs dated between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1250   that grace the sides of massive sandstone spires. As you walk the free trail, maybe you'll be the first to figure out exactly what the ancient Athapaskan Native Americans were trying to tell people through their art.

AABJILs	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	5 tips for keeping your grill from rusting	How to keep your grill from rusting	How to keep your grill from rusting Care for your grill Whether you've spent $100 or $1000 to purchase a grill, grills are an investment. To prevent your grill from rusting and keep it operational as long as possible before needing to buy a replacement, follow these simple tips to ensure that you will be grilling food in your backyard for many years to come. While following these tips will help prevent rust from taking over your grill, it's a good idea to inspect your grill for rust each time before cooking on it , as grilling with loose rust isn't safe, and consuming rust can lead to health problems over time. 1. Avoid pouring liquids directly onto your grill While many of us love BBQ sauce, to avoid excess sauce running into your grill's burners and potentially clogging or rusting them , apply any marinades directly to your food while in the kitchen and not while grilling. Related: 2. Keep it clean Grills should be cleaned after each use to prevent rust. Make sure to turn a gas grill's burners off before cleaning, and use a grill brush to remove any particles that may be stuck to the grates. You may also want to consider cleaning with a bristle-free grill brush to avoid any wire bristles coming loose and sticking to your grates. For charcoal grills, it's best to clean them while still hot, using a brush and a sprinkle of water. After cleaning the grates and allowing the grill to cool, throw away any remaining ashes or leftover coals in the grill and clean the cookbox with mild soapy water. 3. Give it a deep clean every so often It's also a good idea to do a deeper clean on a regular basis. To do so, detach the grates and then clean with a solution of hot water, one cup of mild dish soap, and 1/4 cup of baking soda . Soak them for an hour and then follow up with the brush. After the grill has cooled, wipe the grates down with a soft cloth to remove any lingering stuck-on food or brush bristles. Next, clean the grill's burners with a non-abrasive cleaner and a cloth. You'll want to keep drip trays dry and clean, as they can be especially vulnerable to moisture build-up. With a pipebrush, clean the burner holes and inlet holes too. Don't forget to clean the outside of your grill with mild-dishwashing soap and/or a polish that is suited to your grill's exterior. Despite its name, even "stainless" steel is actually susceptible to stains and rust , depending on the grade and thickness of the metal. 4. Oil Your Grill After cleaning, coat both gas and charcoal grates with a thin layer of vegetable oil to prevent food from sticking to them in the future. Doing this will also help repel moisture and therefore rust. However, to be safe, do not use an aerosol can of vegetable oil , as aerosol cans have been known to explode near flames. Instead, coat a dish rag with a small amount of oil and use that to coat the grill. 5. Cover it and move indoors Moisture is the biggest culprit that will rust your grill and reduce its lifespan. After grilling season is over, put a tight-fitting nylon or vinyl cover with a cloth lining over your grill. If possible, move a portable grill indoors to the garage or a covered shed, especially if you live in a climate that is prone to high humidity, heavy rain or snow. If you live near the ocean, be especially vigilant about cleaning and covering your grill, as the high level of salt in the air may also corrode it.

BBLRPbG	autos	autosconvertibles	2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club First Test: The Perfect Roadster, Now Just More So	Mazda's tossable retro ragtop just got a hit of horsepower	Seventeen percent. It might not sound like a lot, but it is. A 17 percent election victory margin is a historic landslide. If you weighed 200 pounds and lost 17 percent of your weight, you would weigh 166 pounds (talk about getting back in shape). For 2019, Mazda has given its traditionally peppy-but-not-quick MX-5 Miata 17 percent more horsepower, its engine output jumping from a modest 155 hp to an exuberant 181. Does that mean Mazda's tossable ragtop is 17 percent quicker? Not so fast. Let's get our testing numbers out of the way: The refined 2019 model races from 0 to 60 in 5.7 seconds; in three separate tests of the 2016 version of the MX-5 Club, we hit 60 in 6.1, 6.0, and 5.8 seconds. Similarly, the 2019 Miata hits the quarter mile in 14.4 seconds at 95.5 mph, whereas the 2016 version was only one-tenth slower in two tests and two-tenths slower in the other. So the 2019 Miata is not light years faster stoplight to stoplight. It's a tenth here and there (but for you weekend racers, it was 2 full seconds quicker around WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca than the 2016 MX-5 Club). Perhaps more important to everyday driving, the engine feels different. It's a healthier sensation you get underfoot, in your buttocks, and in your ears as the 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-four winds out. Editor-in-chief Ed Loh noted that it doesn't feel like Mazda gave the Miata 26 more ponies, "but rather that each of the original horsies bulked up a bit." In the old MX-5, as you got within 1,500 rpm of redline, you'd feel the power delivery wane and hear the engine get reedy. Not so with the new gen, which has a deeper tone and is content to zing all the way to redline and just hang out. "[In] the original ND, the engine just went south about 5,300 rpm," staff pro racer Randy Pobst said. "It just was wheezing; it was sipping through a straw. And that's not sporty. This Miata revs. It's pulling so well at high revs. It just feels free." Added road test editor Chris Walton: "It doesn't so much add objective performance as it does subjective. Power is solid through the rev range. I found myself shifting far less often third gear for longer stretches and fourth occasionally for the fast bits." What does the seat-cushion stopwatch indicate? Features editor Scott Evans answers that query: "Before, you spent a lot of time at full throttle thinking, 'Man, I wish it had just a little more.' Now, you keep it floored and you think, 'This is the perfect amount of power. '" Engine upgrades include lighter pistons and connecting rods, as well as reconfigured intake ports and higher-pressure fuel injectors for improved efficiency. The engine's increased valve opening angle and valve lift height, as well as the increased inner diameter of the exhaust manifold, help reduce exhaust loss. The Miata has long been known for its snick-snick gearbox and easy clutch. Engaging the clutch remains a tip of the cap as opposed to fully doffing your chapeau. There's no need to take the pedal all the way to the firewall. Just a little nudge of your toes will do. For 2019, the Miata receives a low-inertia dual-mass flywheel that promises to improve smoothness and responsiveness over the previous single-mass flywheel. Mazda also increased the transmission's final drive ratio from 3.45 to 3.58. This might be one reason why you can reach 60 mph (barely) before having to perform the 2-3 shift. Although its curb weight is in line with past Miatas, the 2019 took a foot longer 112 feet at its best to stop from 60 mph. Walton noted "a firm pedal, a little dive, a little light in the rear, and good fade resistance even with a couple 100-0 stops." However, around Laguna Seca, the brakes went "bye-bye" on Pobst at the start of his fourth lap. "I was amazed," he said. "It was pure fade. The pedal was still firm. It just flipping wouldn't stop. And that surprised the heck out of me." Of course, most folks don't buy an MX-5 for its power; rather, they delight in its handling, which is communicative and direct at up to 80 percent then thrillingly (some might say startlingly) tail-happy at the extreme. It's the same lovably annoying Miata: flittery, flighty, wiggly, and floppy. In short, its behavior is a reflection of its driver. "The steering is light and precise, and it feels delightfully light and chuckable," technical director Frank Markus said. But Markus also noted an "almost disorienting amount of body roll. The big body motion excursions sometimes result in bump-stop compression events that upset the chassis." Walton agreed: "Turn-in is crisp, but the rear flop is still there. Hops and compressions are not this car's friend; steady state is." During his Laguna Seca hot laps, Pobst deemed the shocks and springs to be too soft: "It rolls a lot, and it oversteers. And I have fun with that, but it's better if it's balanced." He added this caveat racer for the SCCA crowd: "This Miata wants you to brake pretty straight and then go to power and drive through the corner on the power. And the reason for that is because of the way it's tuned, with a little bit of oversteer, which is fun in a way and beautiful. But when I'm going really fast, it's a fight. I'm trying to keep that tail behind me. I'm a trail-braker. My style is to enter the corner with some weight on the nose. This car hates that when you're at the limit. If you put weight on the nose and get the rear end a little light, you've got a lot of oversteer. It would be a difficult car for a normal person to drive fast because they'd have to deal with that oversteer all the time. And most people are not capable of correcting, catching, and controlling a slide." Off the racetrack, just driving around, how does it feel? Even taller drivers, such as myself, didn't feel claustrophobically entombed. Did Mazda somehow find an extra inch of headroom or seat pitch with the top up? No, it just feels that way. I'm 6-foot-1, and I never felt my head come near the ragtop (although my knees were widely splayed, and my tailbone was pinned into the base of the seat back). Similarly, with older Miatas, my sightline was frequently impeded by the top of the windshield frame, and I would have to scrunch down to see out. Not so this time. As is true with all Miatas, the seats offer ample lateral support without feeling confining. And as is true with all Miatas, it's loud as hell inside a run from King City to Monterey on the 101 carried a level of top-up road roar so thundering that the stereo (with cool headrest-mounted speakers) couldn't drown it out. Even with the top up, you can forget calling home from the road, as all your beloved will hear is wind and tire noise. In terms of features, the Miata gets a new standard rearview camera (you can stop with the jokes about the old rearview involving flinging back the ragtop). Other safety bits include traffic sign recognition and automatic braking below 19 mph, as well as different levels of the i-Activsense suite, depending on the trim level. But mostly, we're nitpicking at the Miata's faults. This is a retro racer with all mod cons, coming in a Club trim that will start at around $30,500. (Our tester had additional options) Evans summed it up best: "This remains the best sports car for the money in the world, full stop. You cannot have more fun per dollar spent. They nailed it. This is everything I wanted the Miata to be two years ago. The stiffer rear suspension that still moves and leans with you but doesn't bang down on its bump stops. The freer-revving engine with the sky-high redline. The horsepower-to-weight ratio. All of it is perfect. Don't change anything." 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata (Club) BASE PRICE $30,500 (est) PRICE AS TESTED $35,000 (est) VEHICLE LAYOUT Front-engine, RWD, 2-pass, 2-door convertible ENGINE 2.0L/181-hp/151-lb-ft DOHC 16-valve I-4 TRANSMISSION 6-speed manual CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 2,318 lb (52/48%) WHEELBASE 90.9 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 154.1 x 68.3 x 48.8 in 0-60 MPH 5.7 sec QUARTER MILE 14.4 sec @ 95.5 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 112 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.95 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 25.2 sec @ 0.73 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY/COMB FUEL ECON 26/34/29 mpg ENERGY CONS, CITY/HWY 130/99 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS, COMB 0.67 lb/mile Click the image to see additional slides...

The royals do a lot: greeting fans, conversing with dignitaries, spearheading campaigns for social good. But while juggling it all, they've got to look seamless--not a hair out of place. That's where the royal staff come in. Here, the best photos of royal secretaries, ladies-in-waiting, and more workers making it happen. 1) February 28, 2019 During Kate and William's trip to Northern Ireland, Kate's private secretary Catherine Quinn points the Duchess to where she needs to go. 2) November 28, 2018 Kate's assistant private secretary Natalie Barrows takes a handful of flowers and gifts that Kate has just received from fans. 3) October 21, 2018 Meghan's assistant private secretary Amy Pickerill gives the Duke and Duchess some pointers at the Invictus Games in Australia. 4) June 14, 2018 Samantha Cohen hangs out with her old boss (Queen Elizabeth) and her new one (Meghan Markle) at the opening of the new Mersey Gateway Bridge in Widnes, Cheshire. 5) October 31, 2017 Kate's private secretary accompanies the Duchess to the National Tennis Centre in London. 6) November 3, 2016 Queen Elizabeth disembarks a helicopter, followed by her assistant private secretary Samantha Cohen. 7) September 1, 2016 Prince William waves to fans outside England's Truro Cathedral. His private secretary, Miguel Head, seems slightly less enthused. 8) January 16, 2015 Kate hands Rebecca Deacon, her private secretary, a huge amount of flowers she's received from royal watchers. 9) September 10, 2014 Prince Harry's private secretary Edward Lane Fox gives him some (possibly bad?) news at the Invictus Games opening ceremony. 10) April 19, 2014 Kate Middleton smiles and waves to her fans in Brisbane, Australia, while Rebecca Deacon carries the gifts the royal's just received. 11) November 8, 2012 The Duchess of Cambridge attends a gala, with Rebecca Deacon lurking not far behind. 12) June 6, 2012 Deacon points Kate in the right direction during a visit to Nottingham. 13) August 2, 2012 Deacon speaks with Prince William and Kate Middleton at the London Olympics. It looks serious (or maybe that's just because they're all wearing sunglasses). 14) April 1, 2009 A staffer walks Queen Elizabeth's corgis past President Barack Obama's car, while he meets with the monarch--and gives the cameras an interesting gesture. 15) May 16, 2003 Queen Elizabeth, driving a Range Rover at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, chats with Prince Philip's private secretary. 16) August 7, 1996 In Portsmouth, the Queen's lady-in-waiting Lady Kathryn Dugdale takes the flowers the monarch has just received. The Queen is about to board the royal yacht Britannia. 17) March 30, 1993 Princess Diana's press secretary, Geoff Crawford, speaks with a young Prince Harry during a ski trip in Lech, Austria. 18) June 7, 1989 Queen Elizabeth gets excited at a horse race, exclaiming to her private secretary Sir William "Bill" Heseltine, who seems amused. 19) October 6, 1985 Princess Diana boards a helicopter outside Kensington Palace with Anne Beckwith-Smith, her lady-in-waiting and private secretary. 20) October 27, 1980 While waiting for Morocco's King Hassan, Queen Elizabeth listens to an update from her private secretary, Sir Philip Moore.

AAAdAn8	autos	autosreview	2018 Hyundai Kona 2.0L AWD	A tasty small-SUV blend minus the kick that satisfies.	Just as designer coffee started without much fanfare and then, seemingly overnight, moved into the mainstream, so have subcompact crossovers. Little SUVs such as the Mazda CX-3, Jeep Renegade, Honda HR-V, Nissan Rogue Sport, and Chevrolet Trax are suddenly as ubiquitous as Starbucks. Which makes the all-new 2018 Kona , Hyundai's first effort in this segment, very much of the moment-and not just because it has the same name as that famous strain of Hawaiian joe. For even deeper coverage of the Hyundai Kona , view our Buyer's Guide in-depth review . In our first instrumented test of a top-spec Kona Ultimate AWD, we found it to be a rich, flavorful blend with more than enough gusto to perk you up. But there are Konas and then there are Konas. For this review, we tested the one-up-from-base SEL trim, which has less power, a less ritzy interior, and less standard equipment than the Ultimate-and we found that, sometimes, less is less. The SEL is the Kona we first loved minus the caffeinated kick. Not Enough Beans That missing kick can be traced directly to what's under the SEL's hood-or more accurately, what's not. The SE and SEL trims' standard 147-hp 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle inline-four replaces the Ultimate's 175-hp turbocharged 1.6-liter engine (which also is standard on the Limited), and torque drops precipitously from 195 lb-ft to 132. As a result, the Kona's zero-to-60-mph time goes from a sprightly 6.6 seconds to a lethargic 9.2. The naturally aspirated 2.0-liter's one advantage over the turbocharged 1.6 is that it employs a conventional six-speed automatic with a torque converter rather than the turbo engine's seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. In city driving, the six-speed is both more fluid at low speeds and sharper off the line, but the 2.0-liter's paucity of punch is obvious before you're across the first intersection. It strains to keep up with traffic and sounds labored whenever even modest acceleration is requested. Decaf indeed. Smooth and Sweet, Never Bitter Luckily, the SEL has enough other positive attributes and unexpected features to redeem it from small-SUV purgatory. Power deficit aside, it's surprisingly enjoyable to drive, at least in part due to its relatively low ride height. The Kona has the proportions of an SUV, but it's not nearly as tall as it initially appears. A Lincoln Navigator towers above it like an apartment building, standing about 15 inches taller. Kona drivers will even find themselves looking up at minivan pilots. The Kona feels and drives much more like a car than an SUV-and far better than you'd expect of such a low-cost vehicle. (All-wheel drive adds $1300 to the bottom line across the Kona range; with only its optional $150 black roof and $125 carpeted floor mats, our SEL AWD rang in at $23,705.) You can wing it through switchbacks thanks to crisply progressive steering and a body that leans only moderately in corners. It sticks to the skidpad at an impressive 0.88 g, which is grippier than numerous sedans. Its brake response is reassuring, and the ride snuffs out bad pavement with sophisticated, well-controlled suppleness. Stuffed with Stuff Beyond its unexpectedly refined driving dynamics, the SEL's most pleasant aspect is its long list of standard equipment. Going heavy on the features is a habit for Hyundai, and the SEL comes with handsome 17-inch aluminum wheels, roof rails, heated exterior side mirrors, proximity entry, and push-button start. There are even a couple of AWD-system features that may be superfluous in a vehicle intended to drive on nothing more rigorous than a dirt road: hill-descent control and a button-actuated override that locks the torque split at 50/50 front/rear for better slippery-surface launch traction. And there's plenty more. The Kona's interior is acceptably roomy for four adults, and its design is handsome, although in the SEL it's a sea of hard black plastic-not uncommon for SUVs at this price point. But the comfortable cloth seats are heated (the driver's seat is equipped with manual height adjustment), the tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel is wrapped in leather, the rear seat has a fold-down center armrest with cupholders, the vanity mirrors are illuminated, the front windows have auto down/up capability, there's a flip-down sunglasses case in the overhead console, and a good-looking 3.5-inch display broadcasts information between the analog speedometer and the tach. The SEL's infotainment system offers a 7.0-inch LCD touchscreen with clearly rendered graphics and intuitive screen controls. It comes with a decent-sounding audio system, Sirius XM radio, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability, and both a USB and an auxiliary port. Hyundai also throws in two active-safety features: blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. The one thing the Kona is short on, relative to most other subcompact SUVs, is cargo room. There's 19 cubic feet available behind the second row and 46 cubic feet with the second row folded, but most of the competition offers more-although even the most spacious in this class fall short of cavernous. Optimum Kona While the well-stocked SEL AWD certainly represents a good value, we would nonetheless suggest that anyone considering a Kona step up to the Limited, the next-higher trim level. For $26,980 the Limited AWD serves up a host of extras including leather seats, a power driver's seat, automatic air conditioning, a sunroof, larger 18-inch alloy wheels, and-most important-the feisty turbo engine. The top-spec Ultimate we tested has even more standard equipment-including more active-safety gear and upgraded infotainment-but its $29,680 sticker starts to overlap with SUVs one class up, such as the Honda CR-V and the Mazda CX-5. The Limited, on the other hand, strikes us as just the right blend of performance, features, and price. That version of the Kona is a lot like its namesake coffee: It's one strong cuppa, with a robust flavor and plenty of kick.
BBOTCVl	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	Use Your Little Blade Coffee Grinder for Everything But Coffee	It's a jack of all blades	We have had more than one discussion on this site about my problem with making coffee . My husband, who is in charge of coffee at our house, isn't overly fussy about prep or equipment. He is a basic French press kind of guy, and we have found a brand of decaf that doesn't taste like brown water. But he is adamant that coffee beans should be ground weekly. It isn't a noise he loves to make first thing in the morning, so on Sunday afternoons he makes a racket getting the beans done for the coming week. But for all of his simple tastes in coffee gear, he definitely has opinions about grinding . He does not like the little blade coffee grinder that is essentially a super sharp mini chopper that loads in the top, has a little lever you depress, and then flip the whole thing over to empty into the cup shaped lid. He prefers, as many aficionados do, a burr grinder that stores the beans in a hopper on top and empties into a large cup in the bottom. So why do we own not one but two mini coffee grinders? Because it is a tool I use for pretty much everything except coffee beans. I have been taught by more than one chef pal that spices, like coffee, should be ground essentially to order, as needed for recipes. This allows for toasting, when called for, or at the least helps maintain freshness. While I do keep some pre-ground spices on hand, I try and lean more heavily on whole spices in my spice rack and then use the coffee grinder to blitz them to my desired level of fineness. Many Greek and Middle Eastern recipes, after centuries of mortar and pestle work, call for a coarser grind that allows for intense pops of flavor throughout dishes. So, pre-ground spices would actually fundamentally change the experience for the eater. I keep one grinder just for spices, using a soft paintbrush to clean it out between uses, and the occasional grinding of coarse rock salt to really clean it and sharpen the blade a bit. I use the other grinder for less pungent ingredients. Chopping chocolate or toasting nuts for baking is the work of mere moments. Fresh citrus sliced thin and baked low and slow to dehydrate and crisp, then cooled and ground to powder becomes a powerhouse ingredient for punching up everything from soups and stews to salad dressings to baking. Mixed with either salt or sugar, these citrus powders can become a garnish for savory and sweet dishes alike. Pre-grated parmesan, while a convenience, is full of anti-clumping agents that affect the melting properties and taste, not to mention that it dries out quickly. Being able to break off just enough cheese from a large block and whirr it up to powder in the grinder makes your pastas sing the way they should. And any leftover toasted heel of bread can become instant breadcrumbs to coat a cutlet or top a casserole. Need fresh soft breadcrumbs for a meatball or meatloaf situation? No problem, the grinder handles the soft stuff just as well as the hard. And my personal favorite, on a hot summer day, three or four ice cubes become crushed ice in seconds, making an afternoon quencher of homemade mint tea or lemonade something of a decadent indulgence, and on a weekend, may tempt you to day-drinking of a more spirited nature. While I cannot in good conscience recommend that you buy a small coffee grinder for your coffee, I can whole-heartedly recommend you acquire a couple of them to use for just about anything else. With upcoming holiday sales and price reductions, keep an eye out for a good deal and buy yourself a little present or two. They will become one of the most used items in your pantry.
BBLZ3n0	lifestyle	lifestylehoroscope	The Least Compatible Zodiac Signs: Warning These Signs Don't Get Along	Who are you totally romantically incompatible with?	Who are you totally romantically incompatible with? Incompatible Match: Aries   Cancer Aries and Cancer are a terrible match Adventurous Aries personality don't hang around long enough for the sensitive zodiac sign Cancer personality to really come out of their shells and therefore don't give time for relationships to develop. This pair will get on like a house of fire at the beginning, but their very different characters will eventually drive them apart. Incompatible Match: Taurus   Aquarius Taurus and Aquarius are too similar Both are as stubborn and headstrong as each other and neither wants to let the other have the upper hand. Taurus personality people are very practical and logic, which means they struggle to understand the creative zodiac sign Aquarian's way of thinking. Both Taurus and Aquarius are hard workers, so a professional relationship between them would be great, just steer clear of romance. Incompatible Match: Gemini   Cancer Gemini and Cancer are totally incompatible These zodiacs probably make the least compatible pairing of all the signs. The Gemini personality is known for their brutal honesty and their frank remarks, whereas a Cancer personality is known for their tenderness and sweet personalities. This is a match made in hell. Incompatible Match: Leo   Taurus Leo and Taurus are too stubborn The Leo personality and Taurus' both have really strong, ambitious and bold personalities, but their stubborn characters are where their similarities end. Fundamentally, Leos love being the center of attention and having all eyes on them, whereas Taurus' crave stability and security. Incompatible Match: Cancer   Aquarius Cancer and Aquarius want different things Aquarians are driven by their bubbling enthusiasm and out there personalities, traits which make them very different from Cancer personality people. Their romantic incompatibility is really apparent and will prevent their relationship from becoming serious. Incompatible Match: Virgo   Leo Virgo and Leo are complete opposites These signs are totally different and only have few points in common. Virgo personality being an earth sign is calm and collected, then we have Leo a sign of fire, who is feisty, exudes self-confidence and is a total extrovert. This match won't live happily ever after. Incompatible Match: Virgo   Gemini Virgo and Gemini are too different Virgos are naturally very analytical and methodical characters, which is why they have a hard time in love with Geminis. Geminis aren't known for their tenderness and supportive nature, although they are fairly flexible, which could be positive for this partnership. Incompatible Match: Libra   Capricorn Libra and Capricorn have a small chance For the Libra personality, beauty and balance are very important, yet these are also traits that make them incompatible with the pragmatic Capricorn personality. This match isn't doomed however, because their willingness to make things work could carry them through. Incompatible Match: Scorpio   Aries Scorpio and Aries work sexually These two zodiacs will be very sexually attracted to each other right at the beginning of their relationship, however the passion will fizzle out in the long term. Their differences of opinion will eventually tear them apart. Incompatible Match: Sagittarius   Capricorn Sagittarius and Capricorn have no common points The Sagittarius personality is known for their spontaneous and calm personalities, while Capricorns on the other hand are very organized and punctual. Finding commonalities between these two really is hard work; there really aren't too many. Incompatible Match: Capricorn   Gemini Capricorn and Gemini aren't on the same page Capricorns love analyzing situations and thinking things through before jumping into anything. Gemini personalities are goofier and adore having fun and letting loose. Their differences are too great for them to be compatible. Incompatible Match: Aquarius   Scorpio Aquarius and Scorpio have different opinions The intense and high maintenance Scorpio may appear to be a good match for the relaxed and cool headed Aquarius at the beginning. However, their different attitudes and outlooks on life will eventually create friction between them. Incompatible Match: Pisces   Leo Pisces and Leo won't work out The Pisces personality people are big dreamers and can drift off to their imaginary happy place at any moment, Leos on the other hand are bossy and love to be in control. This match isn't a great one and their differences are just way too big for this coupling to work. Incompatible Match: Pisces   Gemini Pisces and Gemini are incompatible Pisceans and Geminis come from totally different worlds and just wouldn't get along in a relationship. Geminis have their feet firmly on the ground, while Pisceans love expressing their creativity. In short, if these two aren't prepared to really make an effort, their relationship won't work.

But in baking, which they say is a science,...	Maybe you don't bake or you are, like me, a baker who's insecure about his prowess. You're surrounded by friends and professional bakers who whip up the most gorgeous puddings. You, on the other hand, are clumsy in the kitchen and imprecise when you cook which, in everyday food, makes for adequate, sometimes even delicious results because it's cooked by instinct and by experience, and always to taste. But in baking, which they say is a science, your inexactitude can mean a broken custard or a soapy banana bread. As a food editor and recipe developer, I put out savory dishes mostly. In part because my column largely addresses dinner, and therefore baking finds less mention. As Samantha Seneviratne writes in her gorgeous tome, The Joys of Baking , "Cooking is a necessity everyone needs to eat but baking is different. No one needs a chocolaty cake or a delectable sweet to survive." This leaves little room, then, for me to show that I do still make desserts in my own life. Maybe not always for myself, but for when my friends come over for dinner, or for when I'm looking to ease into the weekend with a chill indoor project. For such days, there are certain recipes I turn to over and over. These everyday baking projects are foolproof and easy to make. Even more, they require zero precision which is helpful, as I have none. Now, here's what I'd really love: Even if you don't identify as a baker, when you scan these desserts and their ingredient lists, I want you to feel newly confident that people like you and me can, and should , bake. No-Bake Lime Cheesecake To start, there's the simple, straightforward cheesecake, which is a fluffy duvet of lime-tart cream. But it's not too sour; it edges that notional territory between key lime pie and whipped cream, contrasted texturally by the zest-heavy graham cracker crust that lies beneath. This is probably the easiest dessert because there's no baking involved, just a bit of light whisking. The candied lime garnish is entirely optional, but should you be interested: This guide is a good place to start. Nutella Bread Pudding With Blackberry Coulis Then there's the bread pudding. Is there anything better than a messy chocolate dessert you can prep, bake, and eat within the hour? Juicy blackberries are a welcome contrast against the sweet pudding base, as is the coulis (a thin sauce made from some of the strain fruit). My recipe tester slash genius scientist, Rebecca Firkser , recommended a full teaspoon of kosher salt to offset the Nutella and she couldn't have been more right. If there's anything chocolate loves more than fruit, it's salt. Asian Pear Galette With Cardamom Whipped Cream Finally, there's the winter fruit galette, which is just a fancy word for open-faced pie. Galettes are ideal for non-bakers, as they require little skill to achieve a beautiful finished product. All you have to do is make a dough of butter, flour, sugar, and salt (plus my secret ingredient: rice vinegar); roll this out and plop some sliced Asian pear into the center. No crimping necessary, as you just fold up the edges to contain the fruit. Speaking of which, you can dress and arrange the fruit however you like; I went with brown sugar and lemon, which together bubble up into a molasses-scented caramel that tastes great with the pear and whole-wheat crust.

Its premium interior is arguably the nicest in the segment, and a generous list of standard features and a great predicted reliability rating further contribute to its ranking. The Encore also has a comfortable ride, though some rivals feel more exciting from behind the wheel.	The 2019 Buick Encore ranks in the top third of the subcompact SUV class. Its premium interior is arguably the nicest in the segment, and a generous list of standard features and a great predicted reliability rating further contribute to its ranking. The Encore also has a comfortable ride, though some rivals feel more exciting from behind the wheel. Is the Buick Encore a Good SUV? Yes, the 2019 Buick Encore is a very good SUV. High-end cabin materials, comfortable seats, and standard tech goodies such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto all contribute to its appeal. It also has balanced handling and rides smoothly over most roads. The Encore earns above-average fuel economy estimates and an excellent predicted reliability rating. While both its base and turbocharged engines feel strained when transporting more than two people, they are more than adequate for daily driving. Should I Buy the Buick Encore? There's a lot to like about the Encore, including an upscale cabin, a wealth of standard features, a serene ride, and nimble handling. All of this helps to make it one of the best subcompact SUVs you can buy. However, this Buick has a higher starting price than most competitors. The Mazda CX-3 's spirited performance makes it more fun to drive than the Encore, and it costs about $2,000 less. The Chevrolet Trax shares its underpinnings with the Encore, and it costs less by about the same amount. However, its cabin quality is a notch below the Buick's. Should I Buy a New or Used Buick Encore? The only notable change Buick made to the 2019 Encore was simplifying its trim levels by cutting the Preferred II and Premium trims. Their features were made available in other trims. Buick did not make any notable changes to the 2018 Encore, so you may want to consider a nearly identical 2017 model to save money. For that model year, Buick refreshed the Encore, giving it a revised front-end appearance, a refreshed interior design, available LED headlights, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and a standard 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

The Encore has a base price of $23,200, which is a little high for the class. However, the Encore comes with a generous allotment of standard features and a nice interior for a subcompact SUV . There are several higher trims, with the range-topping Encore Essence starting under $30,000. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Buick dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Buick deals page . Buick Encore Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Buick Encore or Kia Sportage? As a compact SUV , the Kia Sportage is a little larger than the subcompact Encore. It has more overall passenger and cargo space. It also has more spirited driving dynamics with stronger engine options; its base power plant outperforms the Encore's upgraded engine. The Sportage earns OK fuel economy for a compact SUV, though the Encore is a bit more fuel-efficient. The Sportage has a comfortable, upscale interior comparable even to some luxury vehicles. With a base price of $23,750, it's in the same neighborhood as the Encore, price-wise. However, the Encore comes with more standard tech features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are upcharges in the Kia. For shoppers who need a little more room, the Sportage is a solid choice, though you won't go wrong with either. Which Is Better: Buick Encore or Chevrolet Trax? The Chevrolet Trax shares many similarities with the Buick Encore. The two have the same base engine and nearly identical passenger and cargo spaces. They share many of the same features as well. The Trax is slightly more affordable than the Encore, though the Encore has a smoother ride, a nicer interior, a stronger turbocharged engine option, and a significantly higher predicted reliability rating. The Encore is the superior subcompact crossover SUV. Which is Better: Buick Encore or Toyota C-HR? The Toyota C-HR debuted for the 2018 model year. The 2019 model offers more advanced safety features than the Encore, even in the base trim. The base C-HR is also about $2,000 cheaper than the Encore. In most other respects though, the Encore is the superior SUV. It offers more passenger and cargo space, as well as a more upscale interior. The Encore isn't known for its sportiness, but it's peppier than the C-HR. It's worth noting that the C-HR isn't available with all-wheel drive, even as an option. If it's in your budget, go for the Encore. Encore Interior How Many People Does the Encore Seat? The Encore seats five on cloth upholstery. The front seats are comfortable, and drivers have good visibility thanks to a high seating position. The rear seats have a decent amount of headroom and can fit two adults without complaint, though as with many small SUVs, the space is tight for three adults. The Honda HR-V offers one of the most expansive back seats in the subcompact crossover SUV class. Encore and Car Seats The Encore has two full sets of LATCH car-seat connectors on the rear-outboard seats. There's not enough room for rear-facing child seats unless the front seats are moved up, leaving less space for front passengers. The LATCH hardware is relatively easy to use, though some anchors may be difficult to pinpoint. The Encore's LATCH system recieved a second-place Acceptable ease-of-use rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Encore Interior Quality The Encore's cabin is quiet even at highway speeds, and the interior is replete with soft-touch materials and upscale plastics. However, the dashboard's numerous buttons give this Buick a cluttered, slightly outdated look. Encore Cargo Space The Encore has nearly 19 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats. That's enough space for more than a dozen full shopping bags. Fold down the rear seats and space expands to 48 cubic feet. A fold-flat front passenger seat allows you to haul very long items. The Encore offers more cargo space than some rivals, such as the Mazda CX-3 and Hyundai Kona , but less than others, such as the Honda HR-V . Encore Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The Encore comes standard with a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot, a six-speaker stereo, satellite radio, and the Buick IntelliLink infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen, dual USB ports, and Bluetooth. The Encore's infotainment system interface is intuitive, and the touch screen is easy to use. Unlike some competitors, this Buick also comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Mazda CX-3 doesn't even offer those. For more information, read What Is Apple CarPlay? and What Is Android Auto? Available features include navigation, a Bose seven-speaker sound system, and the myBuick App, which lets you remotely lock and unlock the doors, start the engine, and check your tire pressure. Encore Performance Encore Engine: Hold the Applause The 2019 Encore comes standard with a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 138 horsepower. Sport Touring and Essence trims are available with a more powerful version of this engine rated at 153 horsepower. Both engines come with a six-speed automatic transmission. Neither engine feels particularly lively, though the more powerful one delivers better acceleration. Power is adequate for city driving, and the stronger engine does not feel sluggish on the freeway, though both struggle when carrying a full carload of people. The Mazda CX-3 offers a more athletic performance. Encore Gas Mileage: Scattered Clapping The front-wheel-drive Encore earns 26 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway. Those estimates are slightly above average for the class. For all-wheel-drive models, subtract 1 mpg from both numbers. The 2019 Mazda CX-3 earns even better fuel economy and will save you about $150 on fuel every year, while the FWD Chevrolet Trax earns 25 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway. Encore Ride and Handling: Standing Ovation The Encore is a terrific daily driver. It provides a cushioned ride even over rough roads, and there is little body lean around corners. The Encore's small size makes it agile and maneuverable, which is great in heavy traffic and in tight spaces. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on all models except the base. Encore Reliability Is the Buick Encore Reliable? The 2019 Encore has a near-perfect predicted reliability rating of 4.5 out of five from J.D. Power. Buick Encore Warranty Buick covers the Encore with a four-year/50,000-mile warranty and a six-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. That's a bit better than the warranties offered by many other subcompact SUVs, such as the Honda HR-V and the Mazda CX-3 . Encore Safety Encore Crash Test Results The 2019 Encore received first-place Good scores in five evaulations conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and one second-place Acceptable score. The IIHS noted that models equipped with the optional forward collision alert provide a Basic level of front crash prevention. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2019 Encore four out of five stars in the rollover tests and five stars in every other category. Encore Safety Features The Encore comes standard with a rearview camera. Available active safety features include blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision warning, front and rear parking sensors, and lane departure warning. Buick Encore Dimensions and Weight The 2019 Encore is about 14 feet long. Its curb weight ranges from 3,237 to 3,358 pounds. Where is the 2019 Buick Encore Built? General Motors builds the Encore in South Korea. Which Buick Encore Model Is Right for Me? The 2019 Encore comes in four trims levels: 1SV, Preferred, Sport Touring, and Essence. For most buyers, the Sport Touring trim is a good choice. It's available with many amenities   including dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation, and the stronger engine option   not available in the lower trims, and you can upgrade to all-wheel drive for $1,500. However, shoppers looking for advanced safety features such as forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and front and rear parking sensors will need to move up to the Essence trim. Buick Encore 1SV The base Encore 1SV trim starts at $23,200. It comes with alloy wheels, a six-way power-adjustable driver's seat, a flat-folding front passenger seat, push-button start, Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hot spot, a rearview camera, satellite radio, two USB ports, and the Buick IntelliLink infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. OnStar and Buick Connected Services are standard, as are QuietTuning and Active Noise Cancellation, which create a hushed interior. To note, this trim is not available with all-wheel drive. Buick Encore Preferred The Encore Preferred has a starting price of $24,600. Besides a rear cargo cover, it doesn't add much of note over the base trim, though it is available with a moonroof, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. The Preferred is the lowest trim to offer all-wheel drive, which is a $1,500 upgrade. Buick Encore Sport Touring The Encore Sport Touring ($25,800) adds fog lights and remote start. This is the lowest trim to offer the upgraded IntelliLink system with navigation ($495). It's also the lowest trim available with the 153-horsepower engine (for an extra $250). Buick Encore Essence The Encore Essence starts at $29,300 and adds leather upholstery, heated front seats, and a heated steering wheel. It's the only trim available with rain-sensing wipers and several advanced safety features. You can add the Experience Buick package, which includes navigation and a moonroof.

The Final Call As far as subcompact SUVs go, the Buick Encore is a good pick, but it's not without its flaws. Its engines are lackluster   particularly the base engine   and acceleration is on the slow side. Still, there are many reasons to like the Encore. It has a fairly upscale interior, lots of standard features, and a superb predicted reliability rating. It's also highly maneuverable and delivers a smooth, quiet ride. Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis.

AABKIuj	news	newsoffbeat	Watch Dr. Pimple Popper Yank Out a 'Spiteful' Mouth Cyst	Get out of your hidey hole, already!	• In a new YouTube video, Dr. Sandra Lee, MD (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) extracts a cyst near a patient's mouth. • In the 15-minute video, she tries to extract the cyst's contents while keeping the incision as small as possible. • Lee manages to extract the cyst and stitch up the incision, leaving the patient's mouth good as new! If this arm cyst extraction deserves a spot in the hall of fame, then Dr. Pimple Popper's latest cyst video deserves a spot in the hall of extreme frustration. Seriously, this one is sooo tough to get through. In a new YouTube video posted Wednesday, dermatologist and TLC star Dr. Sandra Lee, MD (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) wrestles a "spiteful" cyst out of its hidey hole beside a patient's mouth. It starts off satisfyingly enough, if not a little bloody. Lee makes her usual incision, then squeezes out a nice little clump of pus. And then...the frustration. Lee tries her darnedest to get the rest of the cyst out, all while keeping the incision as small as possible. This is no easy feat, my friends! At one point, Lee even reaches into the person's mouth and presses on the cyst from the inside, in an attempt to force out its contents. Finally, Lee stitches things up. "Dr. Lee the cyst whisperer....does it again," one commenter wrote. "Nice clean pop and small incision. Win win!" "Weird thought. When it comes out thick like that it reminds me of crab meat.¯\_(ツ)_/¯," one very creative fan commented. Check out the spiteful cyst for yourself:
AAB2j3e	news	newsoffbeat	What is the purpose of love bugs?	Lovebugs play a vital part in the ecosystems, redistributing essential nutrients back into the soil.	They may not be good for your car's finish but lovebugs are good for the environment, according to the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Particularly the soil. The pesky, slow-flying insects lay their eggs in places with dying vegetation, such as thatch, which is the cut grass spit out by lawn mowers. That's where immature lovebugs, which actually are a type of fly known scientifically as plecia nearctica, live and eat. Feeding on the dead vegetation redistributes essential nutrients back into the ground and that benefits plants and the environment. More: Myths about lovebugs are harder to kill than the pesky insect that plagues Floridians, visitors More: War on lovebugs: Social media reactions, tweets, memes about pesky bugs, cars, windshields "It seems that there are more lovebugs than last year but not nearly the number we have seen in decades past," said Norman Leppla, an entomologist at University of Florida. "We really don't know why their abundance changes from year to year." He said plausible explanations for why there are more some years and not others is rain patterns -- rains kicking in after prolonged drought; as well as a warm, wet winter that enabled the bugs to thrive in the caterpillar stage. The larvae are able to move on the soil surface and might respond to soil moisture, he said. As pupae, they can withstand long periods of drought. Five things you may not know about lovebugs Lovebugs do not fly at night. They do not sting or bite. Also known as honeymoon flies, double-headed bugs, and kissing bugs, the adult insects feed on plant nectar, especially sweet clover, goldenrod and Brazilian pepper. They are drawn to highways by hot engines, exhaust and the vibrations of vehicles. Heat, light-colored surfaces and other engines also attract them. We can thank Mother Nature for lovebugs, not the University of Florida. The myth of a UF experiment gone bad as the source of these pests has been debunked repeatedly.

It's spacious and comfortable, and it has plenty of personality, but the Soul isn't as agile as many of its competitors.	The fully redesigned 2020 Kia Soul ranks near at the top of the subcompact SUV class. It's spacious and comfortable, and it has plenty of personality, but the Soul isn't as agile as many of its competitors. The 2020 Kia Soul is ranked: #2 in Subcompact SUVs #12 in Crossover SUVs #9 in SUVs with 2 Rows Is the Kia Soul a Good SUV? Yes, the Kia Soul is a great vehicle, whether you prefer to think of it as a compact car , a hatchback , or a subcompact SUV . The Soul stands out for its generous passenger and cargo space (which is more in line with a small crossover than a small car), and it has a comfortable interior and lengthy available features list. On the road, the Soul is easy to drive, and its powertrain options provide adequate performance. But some rivals are more agile. We named the 2020 Soul our Best SUV for Teens $25K to $30K because of its overall quality, high crash test scores, and lengthy list of available active safety features. The Soul also won our 2020 Best Subcompact SUV for the Money award for its combination of quality and value. Should I Buy the Kia Soul? The Soul's positives far outweigh its negatives, making it a strong candidate for anyone shopping for a small car or an SUV, particularly if cargo space is a priority. This Kia is a solid value as well because it costs less than many of its classmates. Still, there are many great options among the subcompact SUV and hatchback ranks, so it's worth checking out how the Soul stacks up against alternative options like the Volkswagen Golf or the Mazda CX-3 . Should I Buy a New or Used Kia Soul? Kia rolls out a completely redesigned Soul for the 2020 model year, marking the start of the model's third generation. For 2020, there's a revamped trim lineup and a new base engine that has 17 more horsepower and better fuel economy by about 2 mpg combined. The 2020 Soul also gains Kia's intelligent variable transmission, a type of continuously variable automatic transmission, that you can opt for in place of the six-speed automatic transmission. The new Soul gets a larger standard touch screen (7 inches, up from 5 inches) and more standard features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There are several new available features as well, including wireless device charging, a 10.25-inch touch screen, a head-up display, lane keep assist, and driver drowsiness monitoring. You can likely save thousands of dollars buying a used Soul instead, but you'll miss out on the many updates that come as part of the redesign. If you are interested in a used model, check out our reviews of the 2018 and 2019 Kia Soul , and scroll through our Used Car Deals page to learn about the savings and incentives available on used vehicles. We Did the Research for You: 18 Reviews Analyzed Our car reviews include everything you need to know before heading to the dealership. We combine the opinions of the automotive press with quantifiable data like crash test results and reliability ratings to form a complete picture of every vehicle we rank.

The Soul's base price sits just under $17,500. That's one of the lowest starting prices in the class. There are plenty of more expensive trim options, with the GT-Line Turbo trim starting just under $27,500. That's less than the starting price for many competitors' top trims. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Kia dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Kia deals page . Kia Soul Versus the Competition Which Is Better: Kia Soul or Volkswagen Golf? The Volkswagen Golf is one of the most athletic small cars , particularly if you opt for the performance-oriented Golf R or Golf GTI . The VW is more agile than the Soul, and it doesn't feel as jittery over rough roads. Inside, the Golf is more upscale, and it has two rows of adult-friendly seats. However, it doesn't have nearly as much cargo space as the Soul. The Volkswagen costs a few thousand dollars more than the Kia, but considering its perks, you may find it's worth the money. Which Is Better: Kia Soul or Mazda CX-3? Like the Kia, the Mazda CX-3 finishes near the top of our subcompact SUV rankings. This small crossover is nimble and energetic, and it gets slightly better fuel economy than the Soul. Unlike its Kia rival, however, the Mazda does not offer a turbocharged engine or an EV model. The CX-3's cabin wouldn't look out of place in an entry-level luxury vehicle, and that's impressive considering its starting price is only a few thousand dollars more than the Soul. The Kia has much more cargo space and a roomier back seat, and it also comes standard with features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which aren't available in the Mazda. Buyers who want a more fun-to-drive vehicle should opt for the Mazda, but the Soul makes a better choice for just about everyone else. Soul Interior How Many People Does the Soul Seat? This Kia seats five people. The seats feel comfortable, and they provide a good amount of support. No matter where you sit, you'll enjoy plenty of head- and legroom, and drivers also enjoy a commanding road view thanks to the high seating position. Soul and Child Car Seats The Soul has two complete sets of LATCH car-seat connectors on the rear outboard seats, as well as an upper tether on the rear middle seat. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the setup the second-highest rating of Acceptable for ease of use because some of the lower anchors are set deep in the seats. Soul Interior Quality The Soul's interior is well-built, and the materials quality is OK for the price point. However, the cabin styling is a bit bland, and some rivals look and feel more upscale. Soul Cargo Space The Soul provides good cargo capacitiy. You get 24.2 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, which is enough room for the family's vacation luggage or a cooler and some beach chairs. Fold the rear seats down, and you get just over 62 cubic feet. Soul Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation The standard UVO infotainment system in the Soul features a 7-inch touch screen, six speakers, a USB port, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. Available features include a sunroof, wireless device charging, and an upgraded UVO system with a 10.25-inch touch screen, navigation, a Harman Kardon audio system, satellite radio, and additional USB ports. Whether you stick with the base setup or opt for the upgraded version with a massive 10.25-inch touch screen, the UVO system works great. It's intuitive and user-friendly, and anybody can appreciate the sharp graphics and redundant physical controls for things like audio volume. Soul Performance Soul Engine: Turbo Brings the Gusto You get two gasoline engine options with the new Soul: a 147-horsepower four-cylinder base engine or a 201-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder found in the GT-Line Turbo trim. Both get the job done as far as daily driving goes, but the turbocharged engine feels peppier and delivers quicker acceleration. A feather in the base engine's cap, however, is that you can pair it with a silky CVT, a type of automatic transmission. If you're into alternative powertrains, there's also a Soul EV, which features a 201-horsepower electric motor. Soul Gas Mileage: Not Great, but Not Too Bad The Soul's fuel economy estimates are competitive with, though slightly behind, what many rivals earn. It gets 27 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway with its base engine. The turbocharged engine gets almost the same ratings: 27 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway. The EV model earns the mpg-equivalent of 127/101 mpg city/highway, and it has a range of 243 miles. For comparison to the Soul's numbers, the Volkswagen Golf and Honda Civic both get 29/37 mpg city/highway. The most fuel-efficient subcompact SUVs earn marginally better ratings than the Soul. For instance, the Mazda CX-3 gets 29/34 mpg city/highway. Soul Ride and Handling: Don't Push Its Limits This Kia is perfectly enjoyable to drive, as long as you don't expect too much from it. The Soul rides smoothly most of the time, and it feels poised around turns. However, its vague steering and high center of gravity leave it well behind athletic rivals like the Mazda CX-3 and Honda Civic when it comes to agility and sportiness. Unlike a number of subcompact SUVs , the Soul is unavailable with all-wheel drive. Soul Reliability Is the Kia Soul Reliable? The 2020 Soul has a slightly above-average predicted reliability rating of 3.5 out of five from J.D. Power. Kia Soul Warranty The Kia Soul comes with a five-year/60,000-mile basic warranty and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. How Much Does It Cost to Insure a Kia Soul? The cost of insuring a Kia Soul will depend on a variety of factors, including your deductible, the level of coverage that you want, and the type of insurance that you choose. Your age, gender, location, credit score, and driving record can also have an impact on your insurance rates. Check out our car insurance guide to find the best policy for you. Soul Safety Soul Crash Test Results The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Soul a 2019 Top Safety Pick+, the organization's highest award. The Soul earned the highest rating of Good in all six crash tests, and models equipped with forward collision avoidance assist received the top rating of Superior for front crash prevention. In headlight testing, higher trims earned a Good rating for forward visibility, but lower trims' headlights received the lowest rating of Poor. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not crash tested the 2020 Soul. Soul Safety Features A rearview camera comes standard. Available driver assistance features include a head-up display, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, forward automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, lane change assist, rear parking sensors, rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and driver drowsiness monitoring. Some of these features are part of Kia's Drive Wise suite of safety technology. Kia Soul Dimensions and Weight The 2020 Kia Soul is about 13.8 feet long. Its curb weight ranges from 2,802 to 3,036 pounds. Where is the 2020 Kia Soul Built? Kia builds the 2020 Soul in South Korea. Which Kia Soul Model Is Right for Me? You get to choose from several trims when picking out a Soul. Most trims don't offer any option packages, so you'll need to step up to a higher level if you want more features. Even though the base trim has some nice infotainment features, you should skip over it and look at the Soul S, which comes with many more active safety features. If you're looking for significantly more than the S trim provides, you'll want to look at either the Soul EX or the GT-Line Turbo. Both come with the majority of features available in this Kia, and the GT-Line Turbo is the only trim with a turbocharged engine. Another option that's sure to intrigue some buyers is the Soul EV. There are two EV trims, and both are loaded with features and get outstanding EPA ratings. Kia Soul LX The Soul LX carries a base price of $17,490. It comes with a 147-horsepower four-cylinder engine, a six-speed manual transmission, and front-wheel drive. Upgrading from the manual to a CVT costs $1,500. Standard features include cloth upholstery, a rearview camera, and the UVO infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen, a six-speaker audio system, a USB port, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. Kia Soul S The Soul S starts at $20,290. In addition to the base trim's features, the Soul S comes with the CVT, upgraded cloth upholstery, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, lane change assist, rear cross traffic alert, and driver drowsiness monitoring. Kia Soul X-Line The Soul X-Line sports a starting price of $21,490. Its features list closely resembles that of the Soul S, though the X-Line doesn't come with forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, or driver drowsiness monitoring. It distinguishes itself from the rest of the lineup with unique styling aimed at making it look more rugged and trail ready, though these enhancements are mostly cosmetic   the X-Line trim does not have any added off-roading capability compared to the rest of the lineup. Kia Soul EX The Soul EX starts at $22,690. The EX comes standard with a power-adjustable driver's seat, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless device charging, and an upgraded UVO system with a 10.25-inch touch screen, navigation, HD Radio, and satellite radio. Kia Soul GT-Line The Soul GT-Line consists of two trims. The lower edition, known as the GT-Line, has a starting price of $20,290. Its features list closely resembles that of the Soul S trim, though the GT-Line also comes with a sport-tuned suspension, in addition to two additional USB ports, the larger touch screen, and unique exterior styling elements that add a touch of sportiness. Blind spot monitoring, lane change assist, and rear cross traffic alert are optional in the GT-Line, though they're standard in the S trim. The base GT-Line is also the only trim with a notable option package. The GT-Line Sunroof package ($1,900) adds a sunroof, wireless device charging, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, lane change assist, and more. The Soul GT-Line Turbo starts at $27,490. This trim features a 201-horsepower turbo-four that's paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The GT-Line Turbo's features list contains everything that comes standard in the EX, but the GT-Line Turbo also comes with cloth and synthetic leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, a sunroof, a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display, pedestrian detection, and adaptive cruise control. Kia Soul EV The Soul EV features a 201-horsepower electric motor that transfers power directly to the wheels via a gear reduction unit. There are two iterations of the electrified Soul. The base Soul EV comes with adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, rear cross traffic alert, and the UVO system with a 10.25-inch touch screen, navigation, three USB ports, six speakers, and satellite radio. The Soul EV Designer Collection comes with everything in the base Soul EV as well as leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver's seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging, a Harman Kardon audio system, and rear parking sensors. Check out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Kia dealer. You can also find excellent manufacturer incentives on our Kia deals page . The Final Call The Soul gets a redesign for the 2020 model year, getting some big improvements without losing any of the panache that has made this Kia unique. The Soul retains its boxy shape and quirky styling, and it's still a great choice for moving people and cargo. However, it now has more standard features, more available active safety technology, and a stronger base engine. The Soul deserves to be a serious contender for anyone searching for a small car or SUV. Don't just take our word for it.

Live your happiest and healthiest life ever, compliments of these doctor weight loss tips gathered exclusively by Eat This, Not That! 25 Weight Loss Secrets Straight From Doctors Losing weight may seem like an impossible task, especially with the rise of many fad diets. But according to numerous doctors, losing weight doesn't have to be so complicated. That's why we spoke to a few notable MD experts about doctor weight loss tips that will help you shed the pounds for good! These 25 nuggets of wisdom are small changes you can make in your everyday life that can help you lose weight. As always, make sure to talk to your physician about their own weight loss tips for you and the next best steps. And for more no-sacrifice ways to melt fat, check out these amazing 30 No-Diet Diet Tricks . 1. Drink more water "The first tip I usually recommend to anyone whether it's patients or people I come across is to increase your water intake," says Dr. Cedrina Calder, M.D. , also known as FitDoc. "The vast majority of people do not get adequate water intake throughout the day. So drinking more water helps because that has been shown to increase your metabolism, and it will also help to give off extra water weight that you may be carrying around, too. And just in general it keeps you hydrated. It's needed for all different processes that your body does." Want to make sure you're getting your H2O fix the right way? Here are 16 Ways You're Drinking Water Wrong . 2. Eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages Dr. Calder said to keep a close eye on beverages that are high in sugar, like juice and soda . "Even some of the beverages that have been pushed on us as being 'healthy,' a lot of times are packed with extra sugars," says Dr. Calder. Just how bad is soda for your overall health? Check out the 105 Most Popular Sodas Ranked by How Toxic They Are to find out. 3. Drink less alcohol Yes, it's nice to enjoy a glass of vino, and wine can even be beneficial for your health . But drinking the whole bottle in a sitting may not be the best option, according to these doctors' weight loss tips. "[When] drinking alcohol , people sometimes don't realize how many calories that can pack," says Dr. Calder. "Like mixed drinks, when you're adding juices and sodas and things like that with the alcohol, that's also empty calories that you're consuming."

It's no wonder this is one of the most common doctor-recommended weight loss tips. "I think a lot of people are eating larger portions than they realize, so if you're eating huge portions at a time, you're obviously going to be taking in more calories than if you were eating smaller portion-sized meals," says Dr. Calder. 5. Cook at home Yes, you really can make healthier recipes right at home. Even if ordering out may seem more convenient, you'll be able to see the difference in the scale if you start to cook your own meals. "When making food at home, you can control what's in it when you're cooking it," says Dr. Calder. "So rather than eating out all the time, a lot of foods that are offered in restaurants are packed with calories and packed with a lot of ingredients that may not be as healthy." Need some healthy (and easy!) dinner inspiration? You'll want to see these 40 Dinner Ideas That Don't Need a Recipe . 6. Prep your food for the day Hopping on the meal prep train is extremely helpful for your weight loss goals. "If you have food with you, if you are prepared before you go to work for the day and you have a few meals packed with you, you don't have to worry about being tempted to eat snacks and other things," says Dr. Calder. By packing your own lunch and snacks, you'll be prepared for when hunger strikes, instead of rushing to the closest fast-food restaurant or grabbing an office donut or vending machine snack. 7. Increase your protein intake " Protein helps you feel fuller longer and helps to increase your metabolism as well," says Dr. Calder. She recommends lean proteins like lean cuts of meat and steak, fish or other seafood, turkey, chicken, and leaner ground beef. For vegetarians, they can find healthy protein sources in foods like tofu or different soy products. Dr. Calder also recommends whey protein in a protein shake , which will help curb your hunger for a few hours. Just make sure to not buy anything with extra sugars, she says. Plain whey protein powder works well, too. Want to know exactly how to add more protein to your favorite breakfast treats? Here's How to Make Protein Pancakes, Muffins, and Waffles . 8. Eat more vegetables and fruits Dr. Calder recommends increasing the number of vegetables and fruits you eat. She says green, leafy vegetables are packed with nutrients while still being low in calories. When eating fruit, stick with more moderate amounts because fruits can still have a lot of sugar in them . Eating more fruits and vegetables is a good way to help you feel full off of things that are low-calorie. 9. Eat less starches "I think the average American diet is very high in starches," says Dr. Calder. This can spell bad news for the scale if you're trying to lose weight. If you're not that active and you eat a lot of starches, your body won't use that energy it's taking in, so it's just going to be stored as fat and you're going to gain weight. "If you're trying to lose weight, try decreasing the number of starches you're eating," says Dr. Calder. "Not eliminating them, I'm not necessarily saying you should go keto. Decrease your amount of starches, and focus on eating more whole grain sources of carbs." She recommends reducing the refined carbs from your diet and eating more whole grains instead, because most have more fiber and nutrients in them.

Get physically active "Not only should you modify your diet, but you need to increase your amount of physical activity," says Dr. Calder. "If you're not doing anything, you want to slowly increase your physical activity for a period of time and aim for the recommended amount of 150 minutes of physical activity per week. People say that in order to do physical activity, you have to have a gym membership, and that's not true. You can do physical activity by doing household chores, mowing your lawn, watering, cleaning around the house, taking a walk. Any type of movement is physical activity. It doesn't have to be going to a gym and getting on a machine." You can get started with one of these 25 Easy Exercises That Boost Your Health Fast . 11. Start resistance training "With increased muscle mass, you'll have a higher metabolism ," says Dr. Calder. "That will help you burn off more calories. And as you age it's protective, because it helps to decrease your risk of injuries [and] your risk of falls. You'll have better balance and be stronger, decreasing your risk of fractures because you're at a lower risk of falling as well." 12. Get adequate sleep We're sure you've heard this time and time again, but it's true: Sleep does help with weight loss. "Your body needs to be fully rested," says Dr. Calder. "You want to aim for 7 to 9 hours a night, but you want to make sure it's restful sleep, it's good quality. Not where you're just waking up every hour, that's not good sleep that will be helpful. So you want to create an environment where you're able to get good quality sleep." She also mentions that a lack of sleep can increase cortisol levels and contribute to weight gain, which is why sleep is one of the more common doctor-recommended weight loss tips .

Not in front of a TV or playing on your phone or on the computer. Those things kind of take your mind off of the fact that you're eating, and you'll end up eating more than you would if you were just taking time to eat and eat only. Practicing mindful eating will help decrease the amount of food you're consuming. And obviously, less food, less calories, and that will help with weight loss as well." 14. Try wheatgrass shots Adding a shot of wheatgrass to your daily routine can have incredible benefits. According to Dr. Daryl Gioffre, celebrity nutrition expert and founder of Alkamind , wheatgrass is one of the most powerful foods on the planet and one of the most effective ways to detox and build your blood. "It has a very high alkaline effect on the body," says Dr. Gioffre. "One of the ingredients with major benefit in wheatgrass is chlorophyll, which has the ability to draw toxins from the body like a magnet. The reason why chlorophyll is so powerful is it's basically the same molecular shape as your hemoglobin molecule (red blood cells), except for the center atom, where blood is iron and chlorophyll is magnesium." While Dr. Gioffre recommends a 2-ounce shot at least once a day, you shouldn't drink it like a tequila shot. Instead, he suggests taking a sip, swishing it in your mouth for 30 seconds, and then swallowing. Do that again and one more time until the entire shot is gone. You can even use some cinnamon as a chaser! RELATED: These are the easy, at-home recipes that help you lose weight . 15. Stock up on Greek yogurt "Greek yogurt is great for palatability, satiation, and protein content," says Gerard Mullin, M.D., author of The Inside Tract: Your Good Gut Guide to Great Digestive Health . "Yogurt is also great for feeding the good bugs that live in your intestine, which improves the health of your microbiome , the community of microorganisms that live in your body. More and more research is pointing to probiotics as an effective treatment for weight management and obesity. It's amazing that feeding the good bugs actually helps people lose weight. Organic, grass-fed yogurt is best because you are getting a better omega fatty acid profile. When animals are fed corn, they produce dairy with more omega-6s, but grass-fed animals produce dairy with more healthy omega-3s ." And so you know which yogurts to seek out and which to avoid when you're shopping, here are The 20 Best and Worst Greek Yogurts, According to Nutritionists . 16. Cut back on the caffeine "I try to avoid excessive caffeine," says Dr. Mamta M. Mamik, MD. "An adult can safely consume up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, which is equivalent to four 8-ounce cups of coffee. But drinking any more than that can cause calcium excretion, which, over time, may lead to osteoporosis. Avoiding excess caffeine also helps to ward off uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms like lethargy, insomnia, headaches, and irritability." You'll also want to see What Happens to Your Body When You Cut Out Caffeine . 17. Eat more dark, leafy greens "For me, the best food is dark greens, such as arugula, spinach, and lettuce," says Donald D. Hensrud, M.D, M.P.H., chair of the Division of Preventive, Occupational, and Aerospace Medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and author of The New Mayo Clinic Cookbook . "They are very low in calories, very high in nutrients, and can be prepared in a variety of ways that taste great many different types of salads, pasta dishes, lasagna, sandwiches, pesto, soups, or even a spinach pie! There's no downside." 18. Add in chickpeas to your diet "Chickpeas are, of course, a nutritional powerhouse, like most legumes. They are a good protein source, and I especially like turning to chickpeas for protein so I don't need to eat meat," says David L. Katz , M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P.M., F.A.C.P., founding director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center and author of Disease Proof . "They have figured in the human diet since the very dawn of civilization, so they are a nice connection to our ancestral roots. And they figure as well in some of my favorite cuisines from the Middle East. I love good hummus !" Read more: The Only Authentic Hummus Recipe You'll Ever Need 19. Eat more eggs "[ Eggs ] have lots of high-quality protein, especially tryptophan," says Robert Lustig , M.D., M.S.L., Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). "Protein is satiating, and also you spend more energy converting it to a metabolite that can be burned, which aids in weight management. Eggs got a bad rap in the 1980s because of the cholesterol in the yolk. But it does not raise the small dense LDL, which is the atherogenic particle [the one that forms plaques in your arteries]. Eggs are great by themselves, with many different ways of preparation, or they can be added to foods easily." And just how beneficial are eggs for your health? Here are 17 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Eat Eggs . 20. Feel fuller with avocados "I swear by avocados !" says Taz Bhatia, M.D., Founder of CentreSpringMD and author of The 21-Day Belly Fix . "The heart-healthy unsaturated fat in a delicious serving of avocado helps me stay full, which keeps me from snacking too much. Avocados are packed with vitamins C, K, and B6, and they contain pre- and probiotics keeping my gut healthy!" 21. Add in more nuts (or nut butters) "The one kind of food that most helps me live healthfully is nuts, and for me, any nut will do," says Yoni Freedhoff, M.D., medical director of the Bariatric Medical Institute at the University of Ottawa, author of The Diet Fix: Why Diets Fail and How to Make Yours Work . "Study after study suggests that their inclusion in [a] diet helps prevent many chronic diseases. They are full of protein and healthy fats that leave me feeling fuller longer, which in turn helps me all day long with dietary restraint. One trick I like to do is buy a cheap 1/4 cup measuring cup to store with my container of nuts. Nuts are quite energy-dense, with each 1/4 cup of whole nuts coming in at around 200 calories." Dr. Calder also recommends nuts as a snack, but in the form of nut butter. "Even spreading some peanut butter on some whole-grain bread will help make you feel fuller," she said. "The fat in the peanut butter, fat in general, helps to curb your hunger a little bit. You can snack on healthier things like nuts and seeds. Those are great sources of fat." 22. Avoid those added sugars "I try to avoid foods that contain trans-fats, corn syrup, and added sugars," says Eugenia Gianos, MD, cardiologist, Co-Clinical Director, Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Medical Center. "Often listed as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, synthetically engineered trans-fats increase your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and decrease your good (HDL) cholesterol levels, upping your risk of heart attack and stroke." And for more ways to dial back on added sugars, see the 15 Best No-Added-Sugar Snacks . 23. Know your deli meat ingredients "For those who eat meat, processed varieties are a bad choice," warns Dr. Katz. "While the link between meat and chronic disease is fairly tenuous, the connection between salt-, sugar-, and chemical-laden processed meats and chronic disease risk is strong and consistent. If you eat meat, it should be pure like you want your own muscles to be. If you eat the highly processed, adulterated meats, they may pay it forward to the meat on your own bones." Read more: 30 Best and Worst Packaged Deli Meats 24. Watch out for granola or "energy" bars "As a plastic surgeon, I'm always thinking about my figure," says New York City-based physician, Lara Devgan, MD . "To that end, I never eat energy bars or granola bars. Although they can be tasty, for the amount of calorie-dense carbs and fat they contain, you might as well eat a candy bar. Many of these bars are packed with simple sugars, and they aren't quite filling enough to substitute for a meal or snack." 25. Choose when to have your "cheat" meal "There isn't a food I avoid entirely. One cheeseburger never killed anybody unless they choked on it," jokes Blase Carabello , MD, Professor and Chief, Division of Cardiology at East Carolina University Brody School of Medicine. "However, I do limit myself to one per month since the dish is high in heart disease-causing saturated fat and served in a processed bun made with refined carbohydrates." Even though an occasional cheat meal is one of the many doctor weight loss tips, make sure to arm yourself with some cheat meal strategies before diving into that burger.

It has a high-end interior and sporty handling, but its abysmal reliability rating and cramped rear-seat legroom hold it back.	The 2015 Ford Focus sits in the middle of our compact car rankings. It has a high-end interior and sporty handling, but its abysmal reliability rating and cramped rear-seat legroom hold it back. The 2015 Ford Focus is ranked: #11 in 2015 Compact Cars #13 in 2015 Hatchbacks #16 in 2015 Affordable Small Cars #18 in Used Small Cars $12K to $14K #21 in Used Hatchbacks $12K to $15K #41 in Used Compact Cars $10K to $15K Is the 2015 Ford Focus a Good Used Car? Yes, the 2015 Focus is a decent used compact car . This Ford has a comfortable cabin and engaging performance, especially in the sporty ST trim with a powerful engine. However, it has a poor reliability rating and tight rear seats. Why You Can Trust Us We do not base our used car rankings and reviews on our personal opinions. Instead, we collect information like safety and reliability reports, total cost of ownership estimates, and the views of the automotive press. We analyzed 81 professional evaluations for this 2015 Ford Focus review to help you make an informed buying decision. Our experienced team of writers, editors, and analysts has been ranking and reviewing the best cars, trucks, crossovers, and SUVs since 2007. We remain unbiased by refusing pricey gifts and trips from auto manufacturers, and employing an independent agency to manage the advertising on our site. How Much Is the 2015 Ford Focus? Our site has almost 2,900 listings for the 2015 Ford Focus, with an average price of about $12,900. Prices range from about $10,000 to roughly $16,800, and vary depending on the vehicle's condition, mileage, features, and location. How Much Does the 2015 Ford Focus Cost to Own? Five-year costs for gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs for the 2015 Focus are estimated to be about $22,354. That's slightly below average for a compact sedan. Is It Better to Buy a Used or New Focus? There have been few changes between the 2015 model and the 2018 Focus , which starts at $17,950. We would normally recommend the used model in this case, but considering the used 2015 model's poor reliability rating, a new model might be worth considering for its new-car warranty. There are only two well-regarded new compact cars that are priced similarly to the 2015 Focus. The 2019 Kia Forte starts at $17,790, and the 2019 Kia Soul has a base price of $16,490. The base Focus has a more powerful engine than both Kias, and it's also more agile and fun to drive. However, both Kia models earn higher predicted reliability ratings than the 2015 Focus, which has a poor rating for reliability. Which Model Year of the Ford Focus Is Best? The 2015 Focus is part of a generation that launched with the 2012 model and includes the 2018 Focus . Ford refreshed the Focus for 2015, with a new front grille and updates to the car's climate and stereo controls. Other updates include a 123-horsepower three-cylinder engine with better fuel economy and a rearview camera joining the standard features list. There are few differences between the 2015 and 2016 model years, except for the introduction of the sportier RS trim and a more responsive SYNC 3 infotainment system. If you can afford the upgrade, the 2016 Focus may be a better option because it comes with an easier-to-use infotainment system compared to prior models. Looking for performance on a budget? The Focus ST has a 252-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission. This model debuted for 2013. How Reliable Is the 2015 Ford Focus? J.D. Power gave the 2015 Ford Focus the lowest reliability rating of two out of five. 2015 Ford Focus Recalls As of this writing, the 2015 Focus has seven recalls. They involve a charge cord that may overheat and cause a fire, a transmission that may leak fluid, a hatch that may open with only one touch of the release button, and doors that may accidently open. Other recalls address pinion gear wear that may lead to loss of power, the engine potentially not turning off as expected, and a stuck valve that can result in the engine stalling. See more information on Ford Focus safety recalls » Which Used Ford Focus Is Right for Me? The 2015 Ford Focus comes in four trims: S, SE, Titanium, and ST. Whether you want a sedan or hatchback, the SE trim is the most practical of the bunch. It's available with the widest array of features in the lineup, including a moonroof, automatic climate control, heated seats, and several advanced safety features. Thrill seekers on a budget should check out the performance-oriented Focus ST. {"type":"[CPO-Warranty-Text]"} How Safe Is the Focus? The 2015 Focus has good crash test scores, and it earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's 2015 Top Safety Pick designation, which is the organization's second-highest accolade. It received the top score of Good in four crash tests and the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the driver-side small overlap front test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Focus an overall rating of five out of five stars, with five stars in the frontal crash and side crash tests and four stars in the rollover test. The 2015 Focus comes standard with a rearview camera. Higher trims are available with blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, and lane keep assist. 2015 Ford Focus Versus the Competition Which Is Better: 2015 Ford Focus or 2015 Honda Fit? Although the 2015 Honda Fit is a subcompact car , it's still a better choice than the Focus. The Fit has a comfortable, spacious interior with adult-friendly rear seats and generous cargo room. Although it's not exactly sporty, the Fit has composed handling, and its fuel-efficient engine provides decent power. The Fit also earns a higher reliability rating than the Focus. We named the Fit our 2015 Best Subcompact Car for the Money and 2015 Best Hatchback for the Money. Which Is Better: 2015 Ford Focus or 2015 Mazda3? If you're drawn to the Focus for its engaging performance, you'll like the 2015 Mazda3 as well. The Mazda3 is exceptionally fun to drive, with lithe handling and ample power from both of its available engines. The Mazda3 also has an easier-to-use infotainment system, better fuel economy, and a higher reliability rating than the Focus. Between these two compact cars , choose the Mazda3. Which Is Better: 2015 Ford Focus or 2015 Volkswagen Golf? The 2015 Volkswagen Golf and the Ford Focus are similar in many ways, but the Golf is a better car overall. Both have nimble handling, ample engine power, and high-end interiors. However, the Golf has a lot more cargo space and more rear-seat room than the Focus. The Golf also has the higher reliability rating of the two. 2015 Focus Performance How Does the 2015 Ford Focus Drive? The 2015 Ford Focus comes standard with a 160-horsepower four-cylinder engine, which is paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. A 123-horsepower turbocharged three-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed manual transmission is available.

With the base engine and automatic transmission, the Focus returns an EPA-estimated 27 mpg in the city and 39 mpg on the highway, which are decent ratings for the class. The three-cylinder Focus is rated at 29/38 mpg city/highway. The three-cylinder engine with the SFE upgrade adds fuel efficiency enhancements, giving it fuel economy of 30/41 mpg. The sport-tuned Focus ST has a 23/31 mpg rating. 2015 Focus Interior How Many People Does the 2015 Focus Seat? The 2015 Ford Focus seats five on standard cloth upholstery. It's available with leather upholstery, heated front seats, and a power-adjustable driver's seat. The Focus ST is available with front Recaro sport seats that have extra side support.

Each of the rear outboard seats has a full set of LATCH child-seat connectors, and the rear middle seat has an upper tether anchor. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Focus' LATCH system the second-highest rating of Acceptable, citing lower anchors that are too deep in the seats. 2015 Ford Focus Features The 2015 Focus comes standard with Ford's SYNC voice-control system, a USB port, and Bluetooth. Some used models come with upgrades like navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, and the MyFord Touch infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen. The controls on the Focus' center stack are straightforward, as are its numerous steering wheel-mounted buttons. The MyFord Touch system is more user-friendly than it was in prior model years, but some rivals offer more clear-cut infotainment systems. 2015 Ford Focus Dimensions Ford Focus Cargo Space The 2015 Focus sedan has 13.2 cubic feet of trunk space, which is typical for the compact car class . The Focus hatchback provides 23.8 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats and 44.8 cubic feet with them folded.

BBM4c2a	music	music-gallery	50 Greatest Frontmen in Rock and Roll History	They define what it means to be a rock star	They define what it means to be a rock star The greatest frontmen in history Rebellious and spiritual, known for delivering socially conscious messages with expressive vocals and a grandiose performing style, Bono has led the Irish band U2 to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a record 22 Grammy Awards. He has since solidified himself as one of the most compelling frontmen in rock and roll history. Here, in honor of his birthday, are some other rock legends that made the cut. Robert Plant He had it all: an electrifying voice, tremendous range, incredible hair and, according to one fan poll, "the best bare chest in rock." Yet Led Zeppelin's frontman was surprisingly modest about his swaggering stage presence. "It's not some great work of beauty and love to be a rock and roll singer," he says. "I got a few moves from Elvis and one or two from Sonny Boy Williamson II and Howlin' Wolf and just threw them all together." Freddie Mercury A flamboyant showman with a four-octave vocal range, Queen's leader was lauded worldwide for his electrifying stage presence. "Of all the more theatrical rock performers," said David Bowie, "Freddie took it further than the rest he took it over the edge. He was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand." Mick Jagger It's almost impossible to imagine the music world without the pouty-lipped embodiment of sex, drugs and rock and roll. "When I was 18 or so," says Sir Mick, now 75, "the Rolling Stones were just starting to play some clubs around London. And I realized I was getting a lot of girl action when normally I hadn't gotten much. And I'm going, 'Well, this is good.'" Bruce Springsteen With an uncanny ability to bring a crowd to its feet and keep them there for three or four hours, New Jersey's favorite son connects with his audience like no other rock star. "The first thing that I do every night is to look at the faces in front of me, very individually," Springsteen has said of his performances with the E Street Band. "People come to be moved, for something to happen to them." Bob Marley The leader of Bob Marley and the Wailers was a mesmerizing and singular performer whose impassioned songs of peace, love and understanding resonate as much today as they did when first performed. "It's hard to compare Marley to other musicians, because music was just one part of what he was," says the Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean. "He was also a humanitarian and a revolutionary. Marley was like Moses. When Moses spoke, people moved. When Marley spoke, they moved as well." Jim Morrison The Lizard King expanded the boundaries of rock with a sonorously sexy voice and a tortured poet's soul. "Rock and roll is the sound of angels telling the truth," said Morrison, the Doors' lead singer and rock's greatest bad-boy angel. Iggy Pop Iggy Pop was punk before punk existed, stripped down to the waist and notorious for his unpredictable antics, including originating the stage dive. The former Stooges frontman often says he was influenced by seeing Jim Morrison in action with the Doors. "Here's this guy, out of his head on acid, dressed in leather with his hair all oiled and curled," Pop recalls. "It got confrontational, which I found really interesting. I loved it. Part of me was like, 'Wow, this is great. He's really pissing people off and he's lurching around making these guys angry.' And I thought…'Hey, I can do that.'" Roger Daltrey No rocker has ever swung a microphone around with so much flair. But Daltrey, now 74, has always had a great set of pipes, style and charisma to burn. From his frustrated teenage stutter in "My Generation" to his rock-defining scream at the end of "Won't Get Fooled Again," the Who's golden boy grabbed his share of the spotlight from Keith Moon's manic clowning and Pete Townshend's whirligig guitar action. Said Townshend, "Roger almost invented the pseudo-messianic role taken up later by Jim Morrison and Robert Plant." Jimi Hendrix Even in his early days as a sideman for Little Richard, Hendrix knew he was destined to stand at center stage. After forming the Jimi Hendrix Experience, he proved himself a flash of psychedelic lightning on three albums over a five-year period and with legendary live performances at the Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock. "You have to go on and be crazy," Hendrix said of his guitar-burning, teeth-playing performances. "Craziness is like heaven." Carlos Santana One of the few frontmen who is not also a lead vocalist, Carlos Santana and his eponymously named band have been spreading the gospel of Latin-infused rock and roll for over 50 years. The ultimate compliment: Jimi Hendrix once asked to join the melodic guitar master's band. Sting The seemingly ageless wonder, now 66, still looks and sounds like the spiky haired Brit who sang the menacing "Every Breath You Take" back on the '80s, when he was frontman for the Police. "Sting is wearing a leather jacket and leather pants on stage and not sweating," tweeted one fan at the 2016 iHeart Music Festival. "He is officially a superhuman." Gregg Allman The early death of a world-class guitarist like Duane Allman would have destroyed any other band. But his younger brother propelled the Allman Brothers Band to even greater success after Duane's fatal motorcycle accident in 1971. Gregg's keyboard wizardry and molasses-like vocals remained at the forefront of the ever-evolving band right up until his death at 69 in 2017. "When it's all said and done," he mused, "I'll go to my grave and my brother will greet me saying, 'Nice work, little brother you did all right.'" Dave Grohl In the wake of Kurt Cobain's 1994 death and the demise of Nirvana, Grohl moved on to one of rock's greatest second acts, forming the Foo Fighters and redefining himself as a lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist. "After Nirvana, I wasn't really sure what to do," said Grohl, ranked No. 27 on Rolling Stone's 2016 list of the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time. "I was asked to join a couple of other bands as the drummer, but I just couldn't imagine doing that because it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time I sat down at a drum set, I would think of that. And other people would think of that as well." Steven Tyler The flamboyant "Demon of Screamin'" has personified the yelping-groaning-squealing role of a hard-rocking singer for almost 50 years. "You need personality to be a frontman," said Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry of his bandmate. And, apparently, a closet full of scarves. Lou Reed Copping a New York City attitude and a dry, talking-blues approach to songs about "sex, drugs and lost souls," the "Sweet Jane" singer stood alone for 40 years after his breakthrough as frontman for the Velvet Underground (at times sharing duties with the German chanteuse Nico). Many tried to imitate his walk on the wild side, but no one ever came close to the original. "I do Lou Reed better than anybody," he said. Ray Davies He didn't have a powerhouse voice or a flamboyant stage presence. But the Kinks' Ray Davies set himself apart as a literate, witty singer-songwriter with a sly attitude that cracked wise throughout hits like "You Really Got Me," "Tired of Waiting for You" and "Lola." The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer says he was happy to avoid the role of poseur. "Arty farty, you'll never fool your aunt," Davies once said, "who knew you picked your nose and wet your pants." Eddie Vedder Adolescent isolation somehow led to Vedder to the spotlight. "When I was around 15 or 16, I felt all alone," he once said. "I was all alone except for music." With a Jim Morrison-like baritone that can tattoo your heart, Pear Jam's lead singer is also the only frontman to go solo with a great album of ukulele tunes. John Fogerty Fogerty never danced around onstage. In fact, he was a pretty stiff dude with a dorky haircut in Creedence Clearwater Revival's heyday in the late '60s and early '70s. But, damn, he had the most authentic American voice in rock and roll. The "Proud Mary" singer-songwriter was born in California but somehow soaked up every ounce of the Louisiana Bayou and Mississippi River on his way to becoming a national treasure. Marc Bolan One of the pioneers of the '70s glam scene, the "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" singer was a psychedelic poet and a leading member of the rock and roll glitterati, known for his fuzzy hair, feather boas and top hats. "I saw a potential rock star in Marc right from the very first minute I met him," said T. Rex producer Tony Visconti. Bolan was 29 when he died in a 1977 car crash. David Johansen Fronting one of the premier bands at the nexus of glam rock and early punk, the strutting, shimmying Johansen like the rest of the New York Dolls donned an androgynous wardrobe, wearing high heels and satin, and described his band as "the Dead End Kids of today." "We thought that's the way you were supposed to be if you were in a rock and roll band," said Johansen. "Flamboyant." Elvis Costello Van Halen's David Lee Roth once observed, "Music critics hate me and love Elvis Costello ... because they all look like Elvis Costello." There may have been some truth to the wisecrack when Costello started out in 1977, wearing skinny ties and oversized horn-rimmed glasses. But he immediately established himself as a rock and roll savior for every music lover sick of disco but not quite ready to pierce an ear with a safety pin. Since then, whether he's fronting the Attractions or the Imposters, Costello has always lived up to the title of his groundbreaking debut album: "My Aim Is True." Rod Stewart With "Rod the Mod" previously lead singer for the Jeff Beck Group as their frontman, the British band Faces had two Top 40 hits in 1971: "Stay with Me" and "(I Know) I'm Losing You." But then Stewart's solo career took off with his No. 1 smash "Maggie May." "You gotta be honest," Stewart said of his days as a frontman, "lead singers and lead guitar players always get more attention." Kurt Cobain Sensitive enough to wear a cardigan sweater like Mister Rogers, powerful enough to knock strutters like Axl Rose out of the ring in the early '90s. Cobain amped up rock and roll's grunge factor, despite seeing himself as an unlikely frontman. "I never wanted to sing," he once said. "I just wanted to play rhythm guitar hide in the back and just play." Axl Rose Bandmate Slash once described Rose's voice as "the sound that a tape player makes when the cassette finally dies and the tape gets ripped out but in tune." Yes, the Guns N' Roses singer can shatter eardrums with a scream, but he can also be heartbreakingly emotive on signature songs like "Sweet Child O' Mine." Rose's role model: another master showman, Queen's Freddie Mercury. "Queen has always been my favorite band," he says. "And Freddie is the greatest singer ever, is the way I look at it. He embraced so many different styles." Tom Petty Whether leading the Heartbreakers or co-founding the super-group Traveling Wilburys, Petty shared the rock and roll inspirations/aspirations of an entire generation of future frontmen who were watching TV when the Beatles blew up "The Ed Sullivan Show" in 1964. "There was the way out," Petty recalled thinking. "You get your friends and you're a self-contained unit. And you make the music. It looked like so much fun." Ronnie Van Zant The Southern rock pioneer showed admirable swagger when he called out Neil Young in Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1974 hit "Sweet Home Alabama." Sadly, the "Free Bird" singer flew away too soon Van Zant was just 29 when he and two bandmates were killed in a 1977 plane crash. David Lee Roth A must-see performer for his wild stage antics, karate kicks and howling baritone, Van Halen's original and current lead singer is one of rock's most colorful and dynamic frontmen. "It don't matter what you're doing," says Roth, who rejoined the band in 2007 after more than 20 years as a soloist. "Just as long as you look good doing it." Joe Strummer "I was just looking to stir things up," Strummer once said of his early musical ambitions, a mission he accomplished as the face of the Clash. With a snarl and a low-slung guitar, Strummer helped define what it means to rock out with a social conscience. "It's not just going to be people of my generation thinking of Joe," said musician Billie Bragg upon Strummer's death in 2002, "but anybody who's ever picked up a guitar with the urge to change the world." Joey Ramone An awkward and gangly beanpole, Joey Ramone was one of the most unlikely frontmen in rock and roll history. With his howling hiccup voice, black leather jacket and hands gripping the mike like a spear, the Ramones' lead singer channeled the rebellious, aching heart of every teenage outcast. "When you watched Joey sing," said Bono, "you knew nothing else mattered to him. Pretty soon, nothing else mattered to me." Joe Cocker Cocker fronted two touring bands, performing at Woodstock in 1969 with the Grease Band and recording a memorable live album, 1970's "Mad Dogs & Englishmen" with the early supergroup led by Leon Russell. His gravelly vocals on covers like the Box Tops' "The Letter," Dave Mason's "Feelin' Alright" and the Beatles' "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window" were as distinctive as the body spasms that accompanied every song. "I used to get so carried away while I was on stage that I'd be physically damaged by the end of a concert," said Cocker. Bob Dylan Already a megawatt star on the folk scene, Dylan famously amped it up to 11 when he went on tour in 1966 with the Hawks, later known simply as the Band. A legendary moment in rock and roll history occurred that spring in Manchester, England, when an unhappy audience member shouted "Judas!" at the newly electrified Dylan. After a pause, Dylan sneered, "I don't believe you. You're a liar!" He then turned to the Hawks and said, "Play it f---ing loud!" With that, they launched into a hard-driving version of "Like a Rolling Stone." Now, that's a frontman! Steve Miller He conjured up some of the best monikers in music Gangster of Love, Space Cowboy, Maurice in the Steve Miller Band's first No. 1 single, 1973's "The Joker." Miller then went on to really make a name for himself as one of rock's most successful frontmen. "We're not like a nostalgia act or the normal classic rock act," says the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, still a road warrior at 74. "We're a really good musical organization. When we play, we're there for real. It's not about posing, strutting in tights and stuff. It's all about music, and I've always respected my audience that way." Morrissey So what if he became known as "The Pope of Mope" in the 1980s? It worked. "Morrissey was bookish," one critic said of the Smiths' frontman. "He wore spectacles and a hearing aid on stage; he was celibate. Worst of all, he was sincere, with his music being so intoxicatingly melancholic, so dangerously thoughtful, so seductively funny that it lured its listeners into a relationship with him and his music instead of the world." Bryan Ferry A suave, seductive crooner, Ferry brought a touch of elegance and dandyism to rock in the '70s. David Bowie once called Roxy Music and its sometimes campy, often bizarre lead singer, "the only band worth watching." Sly Stone Before he pretty much burned out and disappeared in the late '70s, Sly Stone played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock and psychedelia scoring hits such as "Dance to the Music," "Everyday People" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)." Unfortunately, the Family Stone's leader also set a rock and roll standard for drug abuse, missed concerts and disastrous business dealings. No matter. As Sly famously sang, "Different strokes for different folks." Paul Westerberg His "raw-throated adolescent howl" helped the Replacements pave the way for alternative rock in the 1980s. The Minneapolis-based group disbanded in 1991, but reunited in 2012. "Any musician who can stop may be a musician, but they're no artist," said Westerberg. "If it's in your blood, it can't stop flowing." Michael Stipe Superstardom didn't come naturally to R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe. "I turned myself into a performer," he said. "I quit wearing darker clothes. I let the lights be a little brighter…. I just felt an obligation to the audience and the role that I was supposed to be playing. And talk about power that's a trip. Put your hand up and 20,000 people scream." Nick Cave The brooding baritone "creates his own world," one critic said of the Bad Seeds' lead singer. "It's the realm of the personal, the pain, the romance, the rituals, the murders, the misery, the ins, the outs, the ups, the downs and the everything of all human existence." Can't beat that. Jerry Garcia As much a spiritual guru as the leader of a rock and roll band, Jerry Garcia still inspires Deadheads to follow iterations of the band around the country 23 years after his death. Johnny Cash Throughout much of the '60s, Cash's backing band, the Tennessee Three, included one of rock and roll's pioneers, Carl Perkins. The "Blue Suede Shoes" singer happily took a back seat to the Man in Black, playing guitar on Cash's only Top 10 single on the pop charts, 1969's "A Boy Named Sue." Robert Smith A prototypical Goth band, the Cure has been around since the mid-'70s, but the only constant member has been Robert Smith, the vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter. A self-described "drunk rhythm guitarist," Smith says he never intended to be a singer until lineup changes forced him into the frontman role. "His voice is high and husky," wrote one critic. "Like a pop star with a cold and broken heart." Frank Zappa The avant-garde rocker, satirist and contrarian led one of the music world's quirkiest, most innovative bands, the Mothers of Invention, from 1965-69. "You can't always write a chord ugly enough to say what you want to say," said Zappa, who died of prostate cancer at 53 in 1993. "So sometimes you have to rely on a giraffe filled with whipped cream." Thom Yorke Known for his aching falsetto, Radiohead's lead singer and principal songwriter has remained the core of the British band through countless evolutions since their 1993 debut single, "Creep." Yorke's "high and keening" voice is almost instrument-like sweet, haunting and, yes, sometimes creepy. David Byrne As founding member, principal songwriter, lead singer and guitarist of Talking Heads, David Byrne he of the absurdly oversized suit questioned everything. And that included the rockers who preceded him. "No rock moves or poses," said Byrne, laying down the law for the new wave defining band's blend of music, art and theatre. "No pomp or drama, no rock hair, no rock lights, no rehearsed stage patter." And though Talking Heads disbanded in 1991, Byrne can still be seen at his big suit best in Jonathan Demme's concert film "Stop Making Sense," considered one of the greatest rock documentaries of all time. Mitch Ryder The Detroit Wheels were only around for four years (1964-1967), but soulful lead singer Mitch Ryder wailed hard on rocking singles like "Jenny Take a Ride" (with reached No. 1 on the R&B chart) and "Sock It to Me, Baby" (another Top 10 hit despite being banned by many radio stations for being too sexually suggestive). Ryder's influence soon seeped into the work of blue-collar rockers like Bob Seger, John Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen. Shane MacGowan Kicked out of The Pogues in 1991 for his unprofessional behavior and whiskey ways, MacGowan has been confined to a wheelchair since breaking his pelvis in 2015. But he still reigns as one of Ireland's greatest bad-boy rockers. "What is clear with each passing year," says Irish journalist Sean O'Hagan, "is that the great MacGowan songs endure, from the bruised romanticism of 'A Pair of Brown Eyes' to the brutal realism of 'The Old Main Drag.' Not only that, but they possess a visceral authenticity that belongs to a time when rock music was still peopled with outsiders and misfits." Eric Burdon Burdon's deep, powerful blues-rock vocals were front and center in two great bands: the Animals in the 1960s and War in the '70s. An aggressive stage presence from the beginning, Burdon, at age 77, still belts out hits like "House of the Rising Sun" and "Spill the Wine" with a rock and roll swagger. "I may sing the same songs," he says, "but I always sing them in different ways in order to keep the excitement and passion alive." Alex Chilton The husky-voiced teenager who sang the Box Tops' No. 1 hit "The Letter" in 1967 went on to co-found the influential indie rock pioneer Big Star in 1971. Though not a commercial success, the band inspired future alternative rockers like R.E.M. and the Replacements. "Alex was the most talented triple threat musician out of Memphis and that's saying a ton," said Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg after Chilton, 59, died of a heart attack in 2010. "His versatility at soulful singing, pop rock, songwriting, master of the folk idiom, and his delving into the avant-garde, goes without equal. He was also a hell of a guitar player and a great guy." Brian Wilson The most reluctant frontman in rock and roll history, Wilson famously quit performing live with the Beach Boys in 1964 at the height of their early fame. "I felt I had no choice," said Wilson, who now tours frequently as a solo artist. "I was run down mentally and emotionally because I was running around, jumping on jets from one city to another on one-night stands, also producing, writing, arranging, singing, planning, teaching to the point where I had no peace of mind...." His crowning studio achievement: "Pet Sounds," the 1966 Beach Boys album that inspired the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."

AABDHTv	health	nutrition	50 Foods You Should Never Eat, According to Health Experts	This is so depressing.	This is so depressing. What's the one food you refuse to eat? Whatever it is, it's probably because you don't like the way it tastes-not because it contains ingredients that can be damaging to your health . Yet, there are still a lot of foods that fit this description on store shelves, and food industry insiders, who know what goes on behind the scenes, refuse to eat them. We polled some of those insiders-people who know the business and work daily to evict pesticides , genetically modified organisms (GMOs), animal cruelty, social injustice, and unhealthy foods from the food supply-to find out what they know about the dark side of "convenience" foods and what they will eat instead. Take note so you, too, can avoid the worst of what grocery stores have to offer. Whole-wheat bread The problem: Modern wheat is nothing like the grain your mother or grandmother consumed. Today, wheat barely resembles its original form, thanks to extensive genetic manipulations during the 1960s and 1970s to increase the grain's yields. "You cannot change the basic characteristics of a plant without changing its genetics, its biochemistry, and its effects on humans who consume it," says William Davis, MD, creator of Wheat Belly 10-Day Detox . Davis makes the case that modern-day wheat is triggering all sorts of health problems, everything from digestive diseases like celiac and inflammatory bowel disease to acid reflux, obesity, asthma, and skin disorders. The solution: Try eliminating wheat altogether from your diet for a few weeks to see if you note health improvements. But be prepared for the wheat withdrawal syndrome of nausea, headache, fatigue , depression , and a host of other strange side effects. Non-dairy coffee creamer The problem: The health benefits of coffee are pretty impressive, so don't go throwing them away by splashing nondairy creamer in your morning joe. Fake creamers are full of hard-to-pronounce ingredients, including liver-damaging high-fructose corn syrup, inflammatory hydrogenated oils, and artificial flavors, says Will Clover, PhD, author of Eat Chocolate, Lose Weight . The solution: Drink your coffee black, or if you want to add cream, opt for organic from grass-fed cows or organic unsweetened coconut milk without the food additive carrageenan. Grape jelly The problem: Concord grapes are delicious (and are one of the few fruits native to North America), but the way most of us taste them is in the form of sugar-laden grape jelly. "Even though it's given away for free like ketchup in little plastic packets, it's basically a jelly-textured candy loaded with various forms of sugar, artificial colors, and flavors," says Ellen Gustafson, author of We the Eaters . The solution: Gustafson suggests opting for real fruit, honey, or apple butter on your PB&J. If you do reach for jelly in the store, look for low-sugar, organic versions Organic bans the use of artificial colors and flavors and requires that the grapes be grown without the use of chemical pesticides. Diet soda The problem: Isaac Eliaz, MD, founder of Amitabha Medical Clinic and Healing Center, stays away from any diet soda and foods, sugar-free candies, and gum containing artificial sweeteners such as sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame K, and neotame. "The safety data on these sweeteners is shrouded in controversy and conflicts of interest with the manufacturers of these chemical compounds," Dr. Eliaz warns. "Independent research strongly suggests that when metabolized in the body, these sweeteners can cause health-related issues and problems related to metabolism and weight gain, neurological diseases, joint pain, digestive problems, headaches, depression, inflammatory bowel disease , chemical toxicity, and cancer, among others." The solution: From its weight gain effects to the overload of artificial sweeteners, the disturbing side effects of soda are enough to break the fizzy habit. If you're craving a soda but want to avoid the shady sweeteners, enjoy seltzer or kombucha . Canned tomatoes The problem: The resin linings of tin cans contain bisphenol-A (BPA), a synthetic estrogen that has been linked to ailments ranging from reproductive problems to heart disease , diabetes, and obesity. Studies show that the BPA in most people's bodies exceeds the amount that suppresses sperm production or causes chromosomal damage to the eggs of animals. "You can get 50 micrograms of BPA per liter out of a tomato can, and that's a level that is going to impact people, particularly the young," says Frederick vom Saal, PhD, professor of biological sciences, University of Missouri at Columbia. "I won't go near canned tomatoes." The solution: To avoid negative BPA health effects, choose tomatoes in glass bottles (which do not need resin linings). Sprouts The problem: Sprouts have been the source of so many major food recalls that they're really not worth the risk, says Douglas Powell, PhD, food safety consultant, barfblog.com . Be they bean or broccoli, alfalfa or pea, sprouts have been at the center of outbreaks of foodborne illness. Often, sprouts harbor salmonella, E. coli , or listeria; they're vulnerable to contamination because the seeds require moist, warm conditions in order to sprout-ideal conditions for bacteria to thrive and multiply in. The solution: Get the crunch of sprouts-without the added bacteria-by shredding cabbage or carrots onto your sandwiches. If you really enjoy the flavor of sprouts, cook them first, but watch out for cross-contamination. Chicken wings The problem: A single chicken wing has 81 calories and five grams of fat. Given that most people don't eat just one, a lone feast of chicken wings could easily lead to 1,000 extra calories and 50 grams of fat-nearly two or three days' worth of artery-clogging fat! "Since 500 extra calories per day leads to two pounds per week, chicken wings are a recipe for weight gain," says Tasneem Bhatia, MD, author of What Doctors Eat . The solution: If you like chicken, try baked or grilled versions to avoid a calorie overload. Since conventional chicken feed often contains antibiotics to stimulate faster growth, choose organic whenever you can. Non-organic strawberries The problem: Robert Kenner, director of Food Inc. says he wanted to film strawberry farmers applying pesticides to their fields. "The workers wear these suits to protect themselves from the dozens and dozens of known dangerous pesticides applied to strawberries," he says. "When I saw this, I thought to myself, 'If this is how berries are grown, I don't really want to eat them anymore.' I haven't been able to eat a nonorganic strawberry ever since." The solution: Opt for organic strawberries. The Environmental Working Group, which analyzes US Department of Agriculture pesticide-residue data, has found 13 different pesticide residues on conventionally grown strawberries. Butter-flavored popcorn The problem: Diacetyl is used in a lot of fake butter flavorings, despite the fact that the chemical is so harmful to factory workers that it's known to cause an occupational disease called "popcorn lung," says Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at Women's Voices for the Earth. After news of the chemical got out to the popcorn-eating public, companies started replacing diacetyl with another additive-which can actually turn into diacetyl under certain conditions, she adds. "It's a classic example of the need for better chemical regulation and improved transparency on the chemicals used in our food and other household products," she says. The solution: Make your own popcorn using real butter. Pop it on the stovetop in a pot or go an easier homemade popcorn route: Put a small handful of kernels into a brown paper lunch bag and stick the bag in the microwave. The kernels will pop just like those fake-butter-flavored kernels in standard microwave popcorn bags. Non-organic green beans The problem: Green beans are consistently rated one of the riskiest picks in your produce aisle. In a Consumer Reports report , researchers found that green beans tainted with a chemical insecticide called acephate-and its breakdown product methamidophos-ranked No. 1 as a risk driver for chemical contamination. The solution: Make sure you always opt for organic green beans. Better yet, plant your own. They're incredibly easy to grow, take up little room in the garden, and produce a bountiful harvest in less than two months. Farmed salmon The problem: "Fish is naturally low in saturated fat, and some types, like salmon, are also high in omega-3 fat, reducing the risk of stroke and heart attack and inflammation throughout the body. While Americans need to eat more seafood and less red meat, some fish such as farmed salmon are contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals such as PCBs [polychlorinated biphenyls], pesticides [such as dieldrin and toxaphene], and antibiotics, says Margaret I. Cuomo, MD, author of A World Without Cancer . And unlike wild salmon, farmed salmon are fed a mixture of other fish ground into fishmeal and fish oil, and they concentrate more toxins in their fat tissue than do other fish, Dr. Cuomo notes. The solution: "Fish is an important part of my family's diet, and I am very careful to choose wild salmon, rather than farmed salmon," Dr. Cuomo says. Margarine The problem: "If you could pick one type of fat that would destroy your performance, decrease your brain function, damage your health, and shorten your life, it would have to be margarine and other trans fats," says Dave Asprey, author of The Bulletproof Diet . "They lower your HDL cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease, increase your triglyceride levels, and damage your arteries and your heart." Not only that, but the inflammatory fats found in margarine impact brain function through inflammation. The solution: Instead of margarine, Asprey recommends fats like ghee, avocado oil, coconut oil, and grass-fed butter. Gummy vitamins The problem: It's too good to be true. Each serving is about 15 calories a day. While two or three grams of sugar a daydoesn't seem like much, Mark Moyad, MD, MPH, author of The Supplement Handbook , points out that this translates to nearly six cups of sugar a year. Not to mention, gummies contain artificial food dyes and can contain a laundry list of other problematic ingredients: "Many contain gluten, and some also contain corn syrup, carmine, and pregelatinized cornstarch," he says. The solution: "Always go to food for nutrition first," says Dr. Moyad. "Don't teach kids to rely on pills at such a young age." Liquid multivitamins can be a good alternative for kids (especially those who can't swallow pills). Instant noodles The problem: This college staple contains ingredients like MSG that can actually trigger not just excessive food cravings, but painful migraine s, too. The solution: To avoid one of the worst ingredients in the ramen packets, MSG (and all of the sneaky names for MSG)-and to inject some nutrition into your cup of noodle meal-stir up your own healthy noodle recipe. Anything from McDonald's The problem: McDonald's isn't just about food, it's about food mentality, according to Joel Salatin, a sustainable farmer. "It represents the pinnacle of factory farming and industrial food," he says. "The economic model is utterly dependent on stockholders looking for dividends without regards to farm profitability or soil development." Fast food typically is loaded with all sorts of the ingredients mentioned elsewhere in our list: genetically engineered corn, food dyes, artificial sweeteners, and other bad actors in the food supply. The solution: Learn to cook! You might be surprised to find that paying extra up front for a pasture-raised chicken can be cheaper than buying prepared fast-food chicken. Non-organic corn The problem: Today's corn plants are more like little pesticide factories with roots. Most of the nation's corn supply is genetically engineered to either produce its own pesticide supply within the plant or withstand heavy sprayings of chemicals, which wind up inside of the food. That's problematic not just for bees, but for people, too. "I avoid corn because most is genetically modified, and on top of that, most of the seeds are treated with systemic pesticides that kill bees," says Maryam Henein and George Langworthy, directors of Vanishing of the Bees . "And let's not be fooled; the sublethal effects of these pesticides also slowly impair our health." The solution: From ketchup to salad dressing, and even bread, it's hard to escape corn ingredients. "I always try to avoid foods containing high-fructose corn syrup," says Langworthy. "Not only is it unhealthy, but the pesticides used in the production of the corn is detrimental to honeybees and other pollinators." To avoid genetically engineered corn, choose USDA organic or non-GMO verified foods. Artificial sweeteners The problem: Ironically, there's a lot of evidence that suggests that using artificial sweeteners is just as bad for your waistline as using regular sugar. Maria Rodale, CEO of Rodale Inc. and author of Organic Manifesto says, "They're unnatural, nonorganic, taste horrible, and lead to all sorts of bad health consequences, false expectations, and short-term strategic thinking." The solution: Refined white sugar isn't any healthier, but you can replace it with small amounts of nutritious sweeteners, including honey, blackstrap molasses, and maple syrup, all of which have high levels of vitamins and minerals, or make homemade healthy sweeteners that are far better for your health. Processed honey The problem: "Refined honey is among the most insidious sweeteners of all time," says Gerard E. Mullin, MD, author of The Gut Balance Revolution . The pasteurization process eliminates the health properties of honey, essentially turning it into just another form of sugar. Some honey is even blended with high-fructose corn syrup, additives, and other flavorings. The solution: In moderation, raw honey from your local farmers' market has the opposite effect on your health. "Good data show that a teaspoon or less per day of raw honey has positive effects on gut microbiome health," Dr. Mullin says. Raw honey may have an antimicrobial effect against harmful pathogens in your gut, including E. coli . "Honey also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune-regulating, and antitumor properties," Dr. Mullin points out. It can also improve many aspects of your health, including allergies, bone health, diabetes , and wound healing. Agave T he problem: Don't trust the health halo claims associated with the natural sweetener agave. While it is technically a low-glycemic food, it actually drives up blood fructose, which is way worse, Robert Lustig, MD, author of Fat Chance , explains. "Fructose causes seven times more cell damage than glucose because it binds to cellular proteins seven times faster and releases 100 times the number of oxygen radicals [like hydrogen peroxide, which damages cells]," he notes. In addition, fructose is turned into fat in the liver, which contributes to the development of metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. "Glycemic index is irrelevant; fructose damages your body unrelated to glycemic index. Agave nectar should have a skull and crossbones," Dr. Lustig says. The solution: Retrain your tastebuds to not want excessively sweet foods. When you feel like reaching for something sweet, try one of low-sugar fruits . Table salt The problem: Table salt starts out as a healthy sea salt, but the extreme processing that happens next makes this one of the worst things you can put in your body. Manufacturers strip it of all its minerals and heat it to around 1,200ºF, completely changing its chemical structure. The solution: For an all-natural, unprocessed way to add flavor to food, choose Celtic sea salt or Himalayan salt . You'll get a heavy dose of health benefits, including bone support, improved cognitive function, and pH balancing. Food dyes The problem: Small studies link some food dyes to hyperactivity in children and cancer in animals, and that's one reason Michael F. Jacobson, PhD, executive director of Center for Science in the Public Interest, avoids them. Red #3 causes cancer in lab rats, and Yellow #5 and Yellow #6 may contain cancer-causing contaminants. Food dyes, often used together with artificial and natural flavorings, are used to make foods appear more healthful than they actually are. The solution: Read labels every time you're considering buying a prepackaged food. Food dyes can crop up in some really unexpected places, even in healthy foods like cheese and yogurt. The good news? Some companies are starting to remove food dye from foods. Charred meat The problem: While everyone loves a good barbecue, grilling meats can produce carcinogens if you aren't careful. The two most associated with charring are HCAs (heterocyclic amines) and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). HCAs form when meat is cooked at high temperatures; PAHs are created when the flames touch the meat or when fat drips into the flames and produces smoke, which then rises and coats the food, says Natasha Turner, ND, author of The Supercharged Hormone Diet . The solution: To grill more healthfully, lower the heat on your gas grill or increase the distance between the fire and the meat if using a charcoal grill. Choose smaller cuts of meat, flip them often, and use a meat thermometer when cooking at lower temperatures so you can check to be sure the meat is fully cooked. Homemade grilling marinades, particularly ones containing rosemary, can reduce the risk of HCAs by up to 99 percent. Non-organic potatoes The problem: Insects love potatoes. To counter that, nonorganic farmers generally spray chemicals on potato plants several times a year in the field. "But if that's not enough, in many production systems, their vines are sprayed with an herbicide just prior to harvest so they can be more easily harvested," explains Mark Kastel, co-founder of Cornucopia Institute . After harvest and washings, potatoes are often sprayed with a mold and sprout inhibitor. The solution: Buy organic potatoes, including antioxidant-rich blue potatoes, at your farmers' market. "They are cheap and have one of the lowest premiums you need to pay to eat organically," Kastel notes. Breakfast cereals The problem: Don't trust front-of-label packaging to figure out whether a cereal is truly healthy. "I've seen breakfast cereals with up to 10 different kinds of sugar!" says Anne Alexander, author of The Sugar Smart Diet . Not only is sugar toxic and a threat to healthy blood sugar levels, but it can also trigger overeating. The solution: Always read the ingredients label and check for hidden sugars. Sugar lurks in dozens of different ingredient names, including sucrose, cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, agave, fruit juice concentrate, and high-fructose corn syrup, among others. "I try to aim for no more than five to six grams of sugar per serving and as much fiber as possible-I look for at least five grams of fiber per serving-in my cereal." Bluefin tuna The problem: Bluefin tuna is overfished and on the verge of collapse, thanks to the global appetite for this type of tuna, largely from sushi restaurants, says Philippe Cousteau, explorer and cofounder of EarthEcho. The solution: You can still enjoy seafood, but look for sustainable options. Download Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch app for a handy, go-to guide. Undercooked meat The problem: Your supermarket meat could be coated in superbugs. In the U.S., most industrially produced meat comes from farm animals fed antibiotics, which can promote the growth and spread of bacteria that are able to withstand the antibiotics we rely on to treat infections in people, says Keeve Nachman, PhD, MHS, director of Food Production and Public Health at Johns Hopkins' Center for a Livable Future. Government research has turned up bacteria on grocery store meat samples that are resistant to multiple important antibiotics. The solution: "If I eat meat, I want to be sure it's cooked to a temperature that will inactivate or kill those bacteria," Nachman says. "I also am careful to clean meat preparation surfaces and utensils." Fast food French fries The problem: Heart disease has become the No. 1 killer in America. One main culprit, Jillian Michaels , fitness expert, says: Trans fats, aka hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, vegetable oils that have been "reconfigured" to extend their shelf life (but that ultimately harm your cholesterol levels). "Although fast-food fries are a main culprit, I highly recommend reading your food labels and avoiding this toxic preservative wherever and whenever possible," she says. The solution: Bake your fries at home using this simple recipe: Pre-heat your oven to 450°F. Cut a potato into wedges. (Soak potatoes to reduce harmful acrylamide levels.) Mix together one tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder. Coat the potato wedges with the oil/spice mixture and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven. Packaged snacks The problem: Chips, pretzels, and most packaged pastries are highly processed manufactured foods and are typically loaded with some combination of sugar, salt, and unhealthy oils, so they rank high on the glycemic index. "They contribute to blood sugar deregulation and systemic inflammation," says Andrew Weil, MD, founder of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine. The solution: Choose high-protein snacks . They can be satisfying and delicious. "Consider seasonal fresh fruit alone or mixed with a dollop of organic plain Greek yogurt and a sprinkle of freshly ground flaxseed; a small handful of walnuts, cashews, or almonds; or a small piece of high-quality dark chocolate containing at least 70 percent cocoa," he recommends. Shrimp The problem: Shrimp is the most popular seafood in the American diet, and our taste for it has an astounding environmental impact and potentially threatens our health, too. Farmed shrimp generally comes from mangrove forests, which have been clear-cut and turned into filthy ponds doused with antibiotics to ward off disease. "If you want to be a responsible seafood eater, I'm sorry to say you have to give up shrimp," Andy Sharpless, CEO of Oceana and author of The Perfect Protein . The solution: When it comes to the best seafood choices, Sharpless says you're better off eating wild or farmed shellfish like oysters, mussels, and clams, which are filter feeders and help clean the ocean as they grow. "Unlike farmed shrimp, these guys are an ally in keeping the oceans healthy," he explains. Energy drinks The problem: These drinks are typically sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, an ingredient linked to weight gain. "The high doses of caffeine can also disrupt sleep, an essential component for health and emotional well-being during the pubertal years," explain Louise Greenspan, MD, and Julianna Deardorff, PhD, authors of The New Puberty . Energy drinks often contain potentially carcinogenic additives, such as caramel coloring. The solution: Water is best. If you're dealing with an energy slump, try working these foods that give you energy into the mix. Fois gras The problem: Foie gras, the unnaturally fatty liver of a duck or goose, is traditionally thought of as a luxury food item. But the bird lives a far from luxurious life. "The way foie gras is produced involves extreme animal cruelty," says Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States . The ducks are force-fed three times daily for weeks on end, causing their livers to swell more than 10 times their normal size, leading to diseased organs. "The feeding makes it difficult for the animals even to walk," Pacelle says. "That's too much cruelty for a mere table treat." The solution: If you enjoy the texture of foie gras but not the animal cruelty, Pacelle recommends trying Faux Gras, a healthy lentil-walnut paté. Inflammatory vegetable oils The problem: Don't ruin your healthy salad by dumping inflammatory oils all over it. "Most salad dressings on the market today use canola or soybean oil-two major GMO-laden, pro-inflammatory no-nos," says Jayson Calton, PhD, and Mira Calton, CN, authors of The Micronutrient Miracle . Mira points out that even organic versions still contribute to the unhealthy, pro-inflammatory omega-6/omega-3 imbalance. "Due to the adverse processing methods for corn, soybean, canola, safflower, or cottonseed oils, you are essentially ingesting oxidized molecules that wreck immediate havoc on healthy cellular function," she says. "The bottom line is that these oils are not healthy and should be avoided at all costs." The solution: Opt for extra-virgin olive oil or coconut oil.Other safe oils include peanut, sesame, avocado, macadamia, flaxseed, and fish oils. Simply combine the oil of your choice with your favorite herbs, garlic, red wine vinegar, and voilà-homemade Italian dressing! Egg whites The problem: Egg yolks contain more than 80 percent of the overall vitamins, minerals, and healthy fatty acids found in an egg. Without the fat of the yolk, you can't absorb the protein in the egg white effectively, either, Jean Nick, senior information analyst at the Rodale Library, notes. Egg yolks are also a rich source of choline, which plays a major part in providing structural integrity and signaling roles for cell membranes. The solution: Invest in high-quality eggs and feel good about eating the yolks and all. The 2015-2020 dietary guidelines note that dietary cholesterol isn't something you need to worry about anymore. So how do you buy the best eggs? Check out our guide for buying the freshest eggs . Pasta The problem: Most people eat diets that contain an overabundance of refined carbohydrates, and one of the most common culprits is pasta. These refined carbs are essentially stripped of their nutritional value. "While blood sugar problems, like diabetes, are certainly a major concern with increased intakes of refined carbs, the real danger is the amount of inflammation that overconsumption of these 'foods' can cause," warns Jonathan Psenka, ND, author of Dr. Psenka's Seasonal Allergy Solution . The solution: Invest in a spiralizer veggie slicer and start whipping up low-carb pasta alternatives . We promise you'll never look back! Packaged gelatin desserts The problem: Completely devoid of nutrients, this childhood favorite actually carries a warning label in Europe that reads, "May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children." This is largely because of a chemical called Red #40, an ingredient link to hyperactivity. "Most boxes contain more than 10 milligrams of artificial food dyes, artificial flavors, and a preservative called BHA, which has been deemed a 'reasonably anticipated human carcinogen' by the US Department of Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program," Holly Phillips, MD, author of The Exhaustion Breakthrough , points out. The solution: If you are really craving a bowl of the jiggly dessert, look for a more natural, plant-based version made of agar-agar. Dutch chocolate The problem: As high-cocoa chocolate becomes more recognized as a healthy food option, more people are choosing dark chocolate over milk. But some kinds of cocoa are dramatically better than others. In fact, analysis shows that when cocoa has been "Dutch processed" and/or "processed with alkali," it can lose 60 to 90 percent of its health-boosting antioxidants. Choosing brands without Dutch processing is key to making sure your chocolate is as healthy as it can be, says Will Clower, PhD, author of Eat Chocolate, Lose Weight . The solution: When buying cocoa itself, look for natural and unsweetened. For dark chocolate bars, Dutch-processed versions will have to indicate that processing on the label, so be sure to avoid any that list it. Non-organic apples The problem: An apple is the quintessential health food. Too bad conventionally grown apples harbor some pretty damaging hitchhikers. "Conventional apples may contain as many as 47 different pesticide residues on just a single apple," says T alia Fuhrman, author of Love Your Body . "Some of these pesticides, such as thiabendazole and pyrimethanil, are known and/or probable carcinogens. Other pesticides commonly found on apples, such as carbendazim, are hormone disruptors." The solution: Go organic. You shouldn't give up on apples altogether because, as Fuhrman points out, an apple a day can keep the oncologist away-research suggests daily apple consumption is linked to a lower risk of common cancers. Removing the peel of a nonorganic apple might mitigate your exposure to the pesticides it was sprayed with, but doing so means you're missing out on the best part of the apple: Its fiber-rich skin. Fruit juice The problem: Fruit is rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytonutrients, but fruit juice does not provide the same health benefits. "Even if you are label-conscious and purchase 100 percent real fruit juice or make your own fresh-squeezed juice at home, you need to beware of the high sugar content," Dawna Stone, author of The Healthy You Diet , warns. A glass of fruit juice can have as much sugar as a can of soda, not to mention it's void of one of fruit's main health benefits-its high fiber content. The solution: Opt for a splash of real fruit juice added to a glass of still or sparkling water. Or, combine whole fruit and ice in a blender for a refreshing and satisfying smoothie . Even better, opt for a green vegetable juice and add the juice of half a green apple. "I find just half of an apple or other fruit gives my nutrient-dense green juice just the right amount of sweetness," Stone says. Store-bought smoothies The problem: Popular packaged smoothies often contain 25+ grams of sugar in a tiny 8-ounce smoothie! That's more like drinking a soda in terms of sugar. "A great thing about blending from home is controlling what goes into blender," Jen Hansard and Jadah Sellner, authors of Simple Green Smoothies , say. The solution: Take control of your smoothies. You can actually save money making smoothies at home. Rice flour The problem: Gluten-free ingredients aren't always better for you, and some can actually make you gain weight. Rice flour falls on this list, according to William Davis, MD, creator of Wheat Belly 10-Day Detox . "This ingredient is commonly used in gluten-free processed foods," he warns. "It is awful for health and will completely shut down any hope of weight loss, often resulting in outright, sometimes outrageous, weight gain and inflammation." The solution: There are indeed some food producers that have developed gluten-free and grain-free products that don't use junky ingredients and don't raise blood sugar, but they remain in the minority. Better ingredients include coconut flour, almond meal, and chia seeds. White chocolate The problem: The right kind of chocolate serves not only as a sweet treat but as a brain-boosting superfood, too. The problem is, white chocolate's health profile is blank. "The data on the health benefits of cacao is pretty awesome," says Drew Ramsey, MD, coauthor of The Happiness Diet . "Much of this is due to a set of amazing phytonutrients that can increase blood flow to the brain, protect blood vessels, and boost mood and focus. White chocolate is missing all this goodness." The solution: Indulging in a chocolate treat? Look for organic dark chocolate made with at least 70 percent cacao. Cocktail mixers The problem: Raising a glass should be fun. You shouldn't have to stress over obscene sugar levels, fake food dyes with carcinogenic contaminants, or sketchy preservatives created so that the majority of cocktail drink mixers can sit on store shelves for years. The solution: If you're craving a tasty adult beverage, try the healthiest tequila cocktail ever rather than gamble with that neon-green goo on the grocery store shelf. Or order one of these low-calorie alcoholic drinks at the bar. Factory-raised ground beef The problem: Cattle raised in filthy conditions, pumped full of growth hormones, and fed diets composed mostly of genetically modified corn are three major reasons humane, grass-fed ground beef is a better alternative for your burger. But they aren't the only ones, says Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore's Dilemma . Also consider that while a steak or roast usually comes from a single animal, processors of ground beef combine meat from hundreds of animals. "This vastly increases the risk of contamination," he says. The solution: "I love hamburgers, but only eat them when they're grass-fed and ground by a butcher," Pollan says. Swordfish The problem: One of Philip Landrigan, MD, professor of preventive medicine and pediatrics at Mount Sinai's No. 1 warnings to women who are pregnant or are looking to become pregnant? "Make avoiding mercury in fish a priority," he says. Swordfish is notoriously high in the heavy metal, a potent neurotoxin that can damage developing children and even trigger heart attacks in adults. The solution: For a healthy omega-3 brain boost, look for fish that are low in contaminants and have stable populations, such as wild-caught Alaskan salmon, Atlantic mackerel, or pole- or troll-caught Pacific albacore tuna. Fast food mash-ups The Problem: Call them "mash-up" foods. Call them novelty items. Just call them gross. Two fast-food wrongs (a low-quality taco and junk food chips, for instance) do not make a right, both in terms of flavor and nutrition. Marketers dream up these concoctions as a horrifying way to grab your attention. The Solution: Create your own food mash-ups instead. Take some celery, slather on some peanut butter, and top with crumbled cooked bacon. Then, give your creation a hyped-up name-just like food marketeters do! Behold, the "CrunchMaster Bacon PB Supreme"! Condensed milk The problem: Carrageenan, a go-to ingredient in condensed milk, is used primarily to improve "mouthfeel," but it could be the food additive triggering your digestive distress. In a statement to the National Organic Standards Board, Joanne Tobacman, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago, explained that carrageenan itself and its breakdown product create dangerous inflammation. Inflammation fuels life-threatening diseases, including cancer. The solution: Swap in regular milk for condensed milk, or try making your own homemade sweetened condensed milk. Watch out for carrageenan in other foods, too. It sometimes hides out in ice cream, chocolate milk, canned whipped cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, and low-fat deli meats. Corn chips made in the U.S. The problem: We know that chemicals routinely used in GMO crops like corn and soy can prove fatal for bees and butterflies, but science is starting to prove that they're doing a real number on humans, too. "When I am in the U.S., I do not eat corn chips because they are made from U.S. corn flour, which is mostly genetically engineered. Corn destined for corn flour is also usually sprayed with Roundup and usually contains neonicotinoids and fungicides," says Jonathan Latham, PhD, executive director of the Bioscience Resource Project. "It is a true chemical cocktail," he says. T he solution: Since all corn chips, even organic ones, are a highly processed food, opt for fresh fruit or nuts as a snack instead of chips. A second glass of wine The problem: A few glasses of wine can really help you unwind after a long workday. "Between my work schedule and the kids' activities, my days are nonstop. A couple of years ago, my wife and I noticed we weren't spending as much quality time together," Bill Phillips, former editor-in-chief of Men's Health and author of The Better Man Project , says. "So we started a new tradition: After the kids went to bed, we'd uncork a nice cabernet and reconnect for an hour." Quickly, this became the highlight of their day. "But a month later, I noticed I'd gained a few pounds. It was the wine! The bottle is right there, open and beckoning. It's so easy to pour a second glass-even a third," Phillips says. The solution: Phillips says these days, he stops at one. "I just really savor it. I take small sips, and I really pay attention to the flavors in my mouth," he says. "I'm enjoying the wine more, and I'm saving 150 unnecessary calories before bed." Bacon The problem: In 2015, the World Health Organization announced that regularly eating processed meats can cause cancer. The report went so far as to say that regularly eating bacon is on par with smoking and asbestos exposure in terms of cancer risk. Beyond that, eating meat is widely regarded as damaging the environment, compared with a plant-based diet. The solution: John McDougall, MD, author of The Starch Solution , recommends incorporating lots of beans, lentils, potatoes, and veggies into your diet instead of lots of meat, given the environmental and health benefits of being vegetarian. Any food microwaved in plastic The problem: The truth is, even if you source the healthiest foods in the world, you're tainting it if you're cooking it or heating it up in plastic containers in the microwave. Studies show a wide variety of plastic chemicals become unstable and transfer into food when heated. These plastic chemicals are linked to everything from cancer and developmental problems to infertility and weight gain. The solution: Microwave in glass or lead-free ceramic containers to keep toxic chemicals from migrating into your food. Transfer veggies designed to be microwaved in plastic bags into a glass bowl and cover with a ceramic dish to steam.
AAARruy	lifestyle	lifestylecareer	33 things you should remove from your résumé immediately	If you want to make it past the initial test, you need to have some solid qualifications   and the perfect résumé to highlight them.	If you want to make it past the initial test, you need to have some solid qualifications   and the perfect résumé to highlight them. Applying for a job starts with a well-written résumé . The résumé is a good way to showcase your accomplishments, but mistakes could be holding you back from landing your dream job. Here's what you need to remove from your résumé right now. Every job application starts with a résumé. Hiring managers gather résumés to determine when to interview promising candidates - and many use robots to eliminate bad ones before it even reaches a human. If you want to pass that test, you need to have the perfect résumé to highlight your qualifications. Here are 33 things you should never include on your résumé. Jacquelyn Smith, Vivian Giang, and Natalie Walters contributed to earlier versions of this article. Don't put an "objective" on your résumé. If you applied, it's already obvious you want the job. The exception: If you're in a unique situation, such as changing industries, it may be useful to include a short summary. Leave irrelevant work experience out. Yes, you might have been the "king of making milkshakes" at the restaurant you worked for in high school. But unless you are planning on redeeming that title, it's time to get rid of all that clutter. But as Alyssa Gelbard, a career expert and founder of the career-consulting firm Résumé Strategists , points out, past work experience that might not appear to be directly relevant to the job at hand might show another dimension, depth, ability, or skill that's relevant. Only include this experience if it really showcases additional skills that can translate to the position you're applying for. You don't need to disclose your relationship status in a professional résumé. Don't include your marital status, religious preference, or Social Security number. This might have been the standard in the past, but all this information is now illegal for your employer to ask from you, so don't include it. Don't put your hobbies on your résumé. If it's not relevant to the job you're applying for, it's a waste of space and a waste of the company's time. Don't lie. A CareerBuilder survey asked 2,000 hiring managers for memorable résumé mistakes, and blatant lies were a popular choice. One candidate claimed to be the former CEO of the company to which he was applying, another claimed to be a Nobel Prize winner, and one more claimed he attended a college that didn't exist. Rosemary Haefner, chief human-resources officer at CareerBuilder, says these lies may be "misguided attempts to compensate for lacking 100% of the qualifications specified in the job posting." But Haefner says candidates should concentrate on the skills they can offer, rather than the skills they can't offer. "Hiring managers are more forgiving than job seekers may think," Haefner explains. "About 42% of employers surveyed said they would consider a candidate who met only three out of five key qualifications for a specific role." Putting your age on your résumé could be a hindrance. If you don't want to be discriminated against for a position because of your age, it's time to remove your graduation date, says Catherine Jewell , the author of " New Résumé, New Career. " Another surprising way your résumé could give away your age: double spaces after a period. Don't be wordy. When you use a 0.5-inch margin and 8-point font size to get everything to fit on one page, this is an "epic fail," says J.T. O'Donnell, the founder of the career-advice site Careerealism.com and author of "Careerealism: The Smart Approach to a Satisfying Career." She recommends lots of white space and no more than a 0.8-inch margin. Don't disclose upcoming vacations on a résumé. If you took time off to travel or raise a family, Gelbard doesn't recommend including that information on your résumé. "In some countries, it is acceptable to include this information, especially travel, but it is not appropriate to include that in the body of a résumé in the US." Keep your references separate. If your employers want to speak to your references, they'll ask you. Also, it's better if you have a chance to tell your references ahead of time that a future employer might be calling. If you write "references upon request" at the bottom of your résumé, you're merely wasting a valuable line, career coach Eli Amdur says. Remove inconsistent formatting. The format of your résumé is just as important as its content, says Amanda Augustine, a career-advice expert and spokesperson for TopResume . She says the best format is one that will make it easiest for the hiring manager to scan your résumé and still be able to pick out your key qualifications and career goals. Once you pick a format, stick with it. If you write the day, month, and year for one date, then use that same format throughout. Don't use 'I' Your résumé shouldn't include the words "I," "me," "she," or "my," says Tina Nicolai, executive career coach and founder of Resume Writers' Ink . "Don't write your résumé in the third or first person. It's understood that everything on your résumé is about you and your experiences." Refrain from using the present tense to talk about a past job. Never describe past work experience using the present tense. Only your current job should be written in the present tense, Gelbard says. Don't use a less-than-professional email address. If you still use an old email address, like BeerLover123@gmail.com or CuteChick4life@yahoo.com, it's time to pick a new one. You don't need to put "phone" before listing your cell number. Amdur says there is no reason to put the word "phone" in front of the number. "It's pretty silly. They know it's your phone number," Amdur says. The same rule applies to email. Your résumé is not the place for headers, footers, tables, images, or charts. While a well-formatted header and footer may look professional, and some cool tables, images, or charts may boost your credibility, they also confuse the applicant-tracking systems that companies use, Augustine tells Business Insider . The system will react by scrambling up your résumé and spitting out a poorly formatted one that may no longer include your header or charts. Even if you were an ideal candidate for the position, now the hiring manager has no way to contact you for an interview. Don't include your boss' name on your résumé. Don't include your boss' name on your résumé unless you're OK with your prospective employer contacting him or her. Even then, Gelbard says the only reason your boss' name should be on your résumé is if the person is someone noteworthy, and if it would be really impressive. Leave out company-specific jargon. "Companies often have their own internal names for things like customized software, technologies, and processes that are only known within that organization and not by those who work outside of it," Gelbard says. "Be sure to exclude terms on your résumé that are known only to one specific organization." Social-media handles that are not related to the targeted position should be kept off your résumé. Links to your opinionated blogs, Pinterest page, or Instagram account have no business taking up prime résumé real estate. "Candidates who tend to think their personal social media sites are valuable are putting themselves at risk of landing in the 'no' pile," Nicolai says. "But you should list relevant URLs, such as your LinkedIn page or any others that are professional and directly related to the position you are trying to acquire," she says. You don't need more than 15 years of experience. When you start including jobs from before 2000, you will lose the hiring manager's interest. Your most relevant experience should be from the past 15 years, so hiring managers only need to see that, Augustine says . On the same note, never include dates on education and certifications that are older than 15 years. The résumé is not the place to disclose salary information. "Some people include past hourly rates for jobs they held in college," Nicolai says. This information is completely unnecessary and may send the wrong message. Amy Hoover, president of Talent Zoo , says you also shouldn't address your desired salary in a résumé. "This document is intended to showcase your professional experience and skills. Salary comes later in the interview process." Don't use an old-fashioned font. "Don't use Times New Roman and serif fonts, as they're outdated and old-fashioned," Hoover says. "Use a standard, sans-serif font like Arial." Also, be aware of the font size, she says. Your goal should be to make it look nice and sleek - but also easy to read. Don't use fonts that are hard to read. Curly-tailed fonts are also a turn-off, according to O'Donnell. "People try to make their résumé look classier with a fancy font, but studies show they are harder to read and the recruiter absorbs less about you." Try not to use buzzwords. CareerBuilder asked 2,201 US hiring managers: "What résumé terms are the biggest turnoffs?" They cited words and phrases such as, "best of breed," "go-getter," "think outside the box," "synergy," and "people pleaser." Terms employers do like to see on résumés include: "achieved," "managed," "resolved," and "launched" - but only if they're used in moderation. Don't reveal your reasons for leaving your company. Candidates often think, "If I explain why I left the position on my résumé, maybe my chances will improve." "Wrong," Nicolai says. "Listing why you left is irrelevant on your résumé. It's not the time or place to bring up transitions from one company to the next." Use your interview to address this. Don't add your GPA. Once you're out of school, your grades aren't so relevant. If you're a new college graduate and your GPA was a 3.8 or higher - it's OK to leave it. But, if you're more than three years out of school, or if your GPA was lower than a 3.8, don't include it. You don't need to include an explanation of why you want the job. That's what the cover letter and interviews are for. Your résumé is not the place to start explaining why you'd be a great fit or why you want the job. Your skills and qualifications should be able to do that for you - and if they don't, then you're résumé is either in bad shape, or this isn't the right job for you. Keep photos of yourself off your résumé. The traditional answer to this question is no. But there are some exceptions, like if you're an actress or a model, career expert Alison Doyle writes in a post for The Balance Careers . "The rationale for excluding photos has been to protect employers from allegations of discrimination based on race, age, weight, gender, attractiveness, or personal style," she writes. "Plus, many employers are eager to avoid unconscious bias in their recruitment, using strategies like removing college and candidate names from resumes before reviewing them." The résumé is the place for facts, not opinions. Don't try to sell yourself by using all sorts of subjective words to describe yourself, O'Donnell says. "I'm an excellent communicator" or "highly organized and motivated" are opinions of yourself and not necessarily the truth. "Recruiters want facts only. They'll decide if you are those things after they meet you," she says. Don't include short-term employment. Avoid including a job on your résumé if you only held the position for a short period of time, Gelbard says. You should especially avoid including jobs you were let go from or didn't like. Delete your laundry list of daily tasks. Regurgitating what you do all day without describing the value you add to companies does not impress hiring managers, Celeste Joy Diaz, a recruiting manager at Amazon, told Business Insider. Instead, Diaz suggests specifying with numbers and data how you moved your company forward. Using the winning phrase "I created a solve for X amount of customers and it saved X amount of money, using X skill" can help applicants stand out, Diaz said. Remove any unnecessarily fancy job titles. Being specific with your job title, and use the same description an employer would type, Ian Siegel, cofounder and CEO of the employment marketplace ZipRecruiter told Business Insider . "Don't say you're a coding ninja - say you're a Python engineer," Siegel said. Avoid using cartoon images like Bitmojis or caricatures. While it may seem like a good way to attract attention, save Bitmojis and other emojis for Snapchat. Thirty-five percent of senior managers, surveyed by staffing firm Robert Half, said that using these types of images hurt applicants. "Steer clear of including anything that could be considered distracting or unprofessional, such as flashy fonts and images," says Michael Steinitz, executive director of Accountemps. Avoid using color. When you're applying for a job, using black text and a white background is best. The Robert Half survey also found that colorful fonts or backgrounds also hurt job applicants. About 25% of senior managers say that was a negative on application materials.
BBOU2yT	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	How to Make Scrambled Eggs Like a Chef	Make this weekend's breakfast a little more impressive caviar optional.	Scrambled eggs are a breakfast and brunch anchor. If you are the layman, you may throw a few eggs into a Pam-sprayed nonstick pan you got in college and call it a day. If you are a chef, you absolutely do not do that. The perfect scrambled eggs don't take a lot of work, but they do take some finesse. We went to some of our favorite chefs to find out how to elevate our scrambles. Choose your eggs carefully Scrambled eggs only have a few ingredients, and the titular component is immensely important. You want to get eggs farm fresh, so try your local farmers market. "I usually buy them from the same stand I buy my vegetables from because then I know they're feeding the chickens the same produce I'm buying," says Chris Cosentino of Cockscomb in San Francisco (among others). "The chickens are living the good life and this produces a richer yolk." Buy clean, large eggs that come from a good home. "When possible, choose organic eggs that come from chickens that are pasture-raised," says chef Jimmy Ly of Madame Vo in New York. "Do your research when it comes to labels: things like cage-free and pasture-raised are not regulated by the FDA look instead for "certified humane." And if you want to get really fancy , youve got options. Yoon of New York's Yoon Haeundae Galbi has two go-to egg options. "The first are Jidori eggs, which come from a breed of Japanese hens, and the eggs are cooked perfectly tender," Yoon says. "The yolk is much darker than our typical eggs, almost orange, and it creates a thicker and rich texture. I have to venture to an Asian market to find them since they are rare, so if I am just at my neighborhood grocery store I'll buy my second choice option, organic eggs." If you are feeling particularly bougie, follow the advice of The Peninsula Paris executive chef, Christophe Raoux: "Goose eggs are the best, farm-fresh and organic." Prep smart A tiny step can go a long way in your egg game. "A lot of people forget, but bringing the eggs to room temperature is a critical first step," says Ly. "You can do this by taking them out of the refrigerator half an hour before you start cooking, or, if you forget, you can place them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes. The reason for this is that room-temperature eggs will have more volume if they are whipped or scrambled." Experiment with seasoning Get creative when it comes to the seasoning process. "Experiment with your eggs! They are blank canvas," says Ly, who has different methods depending on the meal genre he's going for. "Butter, cream and milk are must for fluffy eggs to go with bacon or sausage," he says. "In Vietnam, cooks like to use fish sauce in scrambled eggs for extra umami. After the eggs are cooked, there's no fishy taste at all, but the fish sauce adds another layer of savory flavor. The dish is usually soft-scrambled and served with rice, or Vietnamese baguette with soy sauce or butter or both. We love to top scrambled eggs with chopped, fresh Thai chilis and chopped Chinese sausage. (Think of it as the Vietnamese equivalent of eggs with bacon)." Like Ly, Yoon's egg extras will add savoriness to your scramble. "One of my favorite ways to make scrambled eggs is with kimchi," Yoon says. "I stir-fry the kimchi first and add my secret ingredient: brown sugar, which gives it a little bit of sweet flavor to balance the sourness from the kimchi. To create a flavorful umami, I mix in shiitake mushroom and bite-sized shrimp." Cosentino changes his ingredients seasonally. "I love crème fraiche and Dijon mustard mixed together," he says. "I add that to the eggs when I'm whipping them which gives the eggs extra depth. I also like using flake salt, fresh ground pepper, butter, and fresh herbs like chives, tarragon, and chervil. I also like to use truffles or caviar, sometimes I use bottarga." Raoux keeps things simple. "Beat the eggs with a fork, and add salt and pepper," he says. He also recommends adding truffle or smoked salmon for something extra. If you're going to ball out with caviar, listen to Raoux and don't ever heat it up. Stone also goes for simple. "I like just butter, salt, maybe a little chives, and a splash of heavy cream," he says. The cream particularly comes in handy. "Add cold cream to cool down the cooking. When it's close to done, take it off the heat and keep moving it, the heat of the pan will finish the egg cooking." Choose the right tools Do as the chefs do and use a proper cooking vessel. "The best things to cook your scrambled eggs in is a small well-seasoned black steel pan," says Jeremiah Stone of Contra and Wildair. Cosentino is also a fan of the black steel pan. "The one I use most frequently is a Mauviel ," says Cosentino. "It's important to use a well seasoned pan, then you don't need Teflon and the eggs won't stick." Raoux uses a water bath technique to slow cook his eggs, avoiding high heat. "Use one large pan with boiling water, use a smaller one inside the larger pan, and cook the eggs in this small one," says Raoux. "This makes the bain-marie." Ly opts for a good old fashioned rustic cast-iron skillet. Make smart choices with your other cooking tools as well. "Use a heat resistant spatula, the smallest you can find, and keep it moving in waves, keep folding from the sides and bottom," says Stone. Don't dry them out At all cost, avoid making a sad plate of dry eggs. "People always overcook eggs," says Yoon. "Scrambled eggs should be as soft as butter, light and fluffy. If you think it's not cooked enough, it's actually perfect at that point, since they'll continue to cook in the hot pan for a minute before you serve them." You may be in a hurry to make your breakfast, but resist the urge to cook your eggs at a high temperature. "Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to cooking good scrambled eggs," says Ly. "You want to cook at a relatively low temperature and let the eggs get there without rushing them." Take heed and start your eggs in a cool pan, watching your burner carefully. "I like to start my eggs in a cool pan with cubes of cold butter over a low heat, the butter keeps the eggs creamy and most," says Cosentino. "As the heat starts to come up and slowly cook the eggs, you have to keep stirring, this keeps the eggs light and fluffy." Flex on the finishing touches Complement your scrambled eggs with the right side dishes. "I grew up in NYC, so I like a variety of different side dishes, anything from home fries to sausage and ham or even seafood at times," says Ly. "Hot sauce is a must though. Shoutout to Truff Sauce, they have some of the best hot sauce out there! For Vietnamese-style scrambled eggs, you cannot beat white rice. A little salt and pepper and you are ready to go." Bread's obviously a classic. "My favorite scrambled eggs side dish is toast," says Cosentino. "I'll sear a nice piece of bâtard with butter and put the eggs on top then eat it like a tartine." Raoux's on the same page. "Baby spinach, well-toasted bread, and mustard, is a traditional French meal," he says. Chef Jimmy Ly's Vietnamese-style scrambled eggs 4-5 fresh, organic eggs 2 tablespoon Red Boat fish sauce 1 tablespoon sugar ½ tablespoon MSG ½ tablespoon black pepper 1/2 cup scallions 1 cup chopped chives Vegetable oil Mix first 7 ingredients thoroughly. Heat your pan on medium-low for about 3-5 minutes until the pan is evenly heated. Add a small splash of vegetable oil to the pan. Pour the eggs in over low heat and stir them evenly and gently. Because of the sugar, the eggs will brown faster, so you will have to stir them in a circular motion so it's more even.

Video by WCVB Boston Perhaps it's best that Roger Freeman did not see the great white shark swimming beneath his paddleboard. It might have unsettled and already nervous paddler in the murky waters off Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Freeman, 54, was standup-paddling alone Sunday morning, hoping to catch a few waves. Fresh in his mind were news reports about a shark attack on a seal the day before in the same area - an incident that prompted lifeguards to temporarily ban swimming and surfing. According to the Cape Cod Times , Freeman did glimpse a shadow beneath him at one point, but assumed it was a seal. While it could have been, there was a large shark swimming nearby. Cody DeGroff had flown his drone-cam over Freeman and could see the shark in his viewfinder. The shark seemed to be swimming toward Freeman. DeGroff's images show the close proximity of the shark to the paddler. (DeGroff allowed the use of two images for this story.) Freeman told the Cape Cod Times that he had seen the drone overhead. "I thought, huh, that's interesting," the paddler said. When he paddled ashore 30 minutes later, an acquaintance of DeGroff's showed Freeman one of the images. Freeman, who was paddling off Nauset Beach, later said he was "still processing" the encounter and added that he wished that authorities had a better warning system in place. However, he said of the risk issue, "We're going into their world, and we have the knowledge and capacity to adjust to their behavior." Great white sharks are off Cape Cod specifically to feed on seals. The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, which is studying the sharks, shared DeGroff's images on Facebook , under the title, "Close encounter of a peaceful kind." The conservancy confirmed the species as a great white shark. Freeman said there's a good chance that he'll paddle off Cape Cod again, but he couldn't say when. -Images used with permission of Cody DeGroff Photography MORE: Twitter Mailbag: Are 49ers keeping an eye on Khalil Mack situation?

BB100Bx9	news	newsus	6-year-old forced to leave school asked cop, "Am I going to jail?"	Nadia King was removed from school and involuntarily committed to a mental health facility under the Baker Act.	A police officer who was transporting the 6-year-old Florida girl who was forced to go to a mental health facility after an incident at school is heard calling her "pleasant" on body camera footage. She also openly questions why the girl is being taken away. Nadia King was removed from school under the Baker Act, a law allowing authorities to force a psychiatric evaluation on anyone considered to be a danger to themselves or others. According to a sheriff's report, a social worker who responded to the incident at Love Grove Elementary School in Jacksonville said Nadia was "destroying school property" and "attacking staff." But, the police body camera video shows a Duval County sheriff's deputy leading a seemingly calm Nadia out of school on February 4. Nadia is heard asking the officer, "Am I going to jail?" "No, you're not going to jail," the officer says. Inside the police car, Nadia asks the officer if she has snacks. "No, I don't have any snacks. I wish I did. I'm sorry," the officer says. The deputy is also heard talking to another officer about Nadia's behavior while she is in custody. "She's been actually very pleasant. Right? Very pleasant," the officer says. "I think it's more of them just not knowing how to deal with it," the other officer says. At one point, it appears Nadia, who has ADHD and a mood disorder, did not understand where she was going. "It's a field trip?" she asks. "Well I call it a field trip, anything away from school is a field trip, right?" an officer replies. Nadia was held in a mental health facility, away from her mother, for 48 hours. Her mother, Martina Falk, broke down while watching the body camera video. "I can't comment," she said. Falk's attorney, Reganel Reeves, said, "She's mortified. She's horrified. Angry." They argue Nadia should have never been taken to the mental health center. "If you can't deal with a 50-pound child, 6-year-old, then you shouldn't be in education," Reeves said. Officials with Duval County Public Schools said student privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case. They said in a statement that an initial review showed the school's handing was "compliant both with law and the best interest of this student and all other students at the school." The family now plans to file a lawsuit. "She's going on a field trip to hell. That's where she was going, and her life has forever changed," Reeves said.

The Gladiator brings Jeep back into the pickup market for the first time in decades. There's good news for rugged pickup fans because the first production-ready examples of the 2020 Jeep Gladiator are now on trucks and heading to dealers. The first shipment left from the Toledo, Ohio, factory on Friday, April 12, 2019. Prices for the Gladiator starts at $33,545 , but a person can take the price significantly higher by picking higher trim levels and loading up the options. The range-topping Rubicon grade has a base price of $43,545, and ticking every available option box results in a pickup that costs $64,110.

The model was based on the Rubicon trim but with different wheels, interior trim, and badges than a run-of-the-mill example of the truck. Jeep only offered 4,190 of them, and the entire run sold out within 24 hours. The Gladiator launches exclusively with a 3.6-liter V6 making 285 horsepower (212 kilowatts) and 260 pound-feet (352 Newton-meters) of torque. Buyers can select between a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic. The truck can tow up to 7,650 pounds and has a 1,600-pound payload. Later, Jeep will add a 3.0-liter diesel to the lineup. It'll make 260 hp (194 kW) and 442 lb-ft (599 Nm). We don't yet know exactly when the second powertrain choice arrives. Expect prices for the diesel to be higher than the gas-fueled engine, though.

With that in mind, here are five artificial intelligence stocks to buy.More From InvestorPlace 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Beat Volatility 7 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks on a Rebound Now	AI is having a transformative effect that will last a long time. With that in mind, here are five artificial intelligence stocks to buy.More From InvestorPlace 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Beat Volatility 7 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks on a Rebound Now [Editor's note: " 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider " was previously published in December 2019 . It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.] I attended a meeting of startup founders who pitched their companies. Interestingly enough, many of them touted their use of artificial intelligence. This technology has quickly become red-hot. After all, the market opportunity is massive. Forbes estimates that spending on AI will reach $20.83 billion by 2024 . Yet AI is not easy to develop. Huge amounts of data must be accessed to find patterns. Moreover, top-notch data scientists must be hired to work on AI. As should be no surprise, this kind of talent is in short supply nowadays. 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Because of all this, only larger companies usually focus on AI. Let's take a look at five AI-intensive companies that stand out: Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, refers to the company as "AI first." And this is certainly not hype. AI has become pervasive across the product line, such as with Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Photos, Google Cloud and so on. The company has also developed its own assistant, which connects with more than 5,000 devices in the home. Google has been creating industry standards for AI as well, primarily through its own language called TensorFlow. Just some of the companies that use it include Uber (NYSE: UBER ), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ). Also, Google is a top player in autonomous vehicles. The company's Waymo unit could be worth as much as $175 billion , according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. 7 Beautiful Biotech Stocks to Buy Here Finally, the valuation of GOOG stock is at reasonable levels, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio at 22.6, which is below other mega tech operators like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). That puts it at the top of the heap among artificial intelligence stocks. Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is the pioneer of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are chips that process large amounts of data cost-effectively. The technology was initially focused on the gaming market. But NVDA realized that GPUs were also ideal for AI. To this end, the company has sold them to companies for use in datacenters and autonomous vehicles. No doubt, it has been a very good move. Consider that NVDA had been on a strong growth ramp before flattening a bit at the end of its last fiscal year. It's true that the valuation of NVDA stock is far from cheap, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio at 28.5x. But then again, a premium is to be expected for a company that is a leader in a massive industry. For example, earlier this year Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse boosted the price target on NVDA stock to $400, which implied 41% upside and now implies a gain of nearly 100%. In his report, he noted that the company's technology is "becoming the standard AI platform." IBM (IBM) AI is nothing new for IBM (NYSE: IBM ). The company has been developing this type of technology for many years. For example, back in 1985, it developed its AI computer called Deep Blue. Deep Blue actually beat chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. Then in 2011, IBM created Watson to take on the best players on the quiz show Jeopardy! . The computer won. IBM has definitely had its troubles. But the investments in AI and other cutting-edge technologies have been making a difference. Note that during the over a recent 12 months period , IBM's Strategic Imperatives, which include cloud computing, security, analytics, Big Data and mobile, generated $40 billion, more than 50% of its total revenues . This has helped improve the growth rate of the overall business. 30 Consumer Stocks to Buy Once the Coronavirus Pandemic Passes IBM stock also has an attractive dividend yield, which is at 4.8% . This is one of the highest in the tech industry. And its valuation is reasonable as well. Consider that the forward P/E ratio is only ten. Yext (YEXT) Yext (NYSE: YEXT ) has been among the most exciting Artificial Intelligence stocks. That's because the company is a top data provider, with integrations of over 150 services from operators like Google, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY ). Yext has also added context and intent to all this, which allows for more accurate real-time searches. "Today, we manage more than 185 million facts about our customers in our platform, providing brand-verified answers in services like Google, Siri, Alexa and WeChat to consumers looking for information verified by the source of truth," CEO Howard Lerman noted on a previous earnings call. Its growth has been strong, as the company has been getting a great deal of traction with enterprise customers. Baidu (BIDU) When it comes to the search business, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) remains the king in China. BIDU has invested heavily in becoming a serious AI company. This has helped it personalize the search experience and improve the impact of online ads. But AI has done more than just bolster BIDU's own platform. The company has created several platforms for third parties. One is DuerOS, which has an installed base of 100 million devices and processes over 400 million queries a month. Then there is Apollo. It is an AI system for autonomous vehicles. Recently, BIDU partnered with King Long Motors to launch the first fully self-driving L4 minibus. The AI efforts have been paying off, and BIDU's business model will enable it to grow easily.

BBLkc0L	autos	autosnews	The Mazda6 Finally Gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto	That certainly took long enough	At the New York auto show last March, Mazda announced plans to add Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support to the 2018 Mazda6. Unfortunately for Mazda customers, that support would have to be added later since the 2018 Mazda6 didn't come with it from the factory. Today, Mazda announced that Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will finally be available nationwide starting in September. For customers who already bought a 2018 Mazda6 in anything other than base Sport form, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will be available as a no-cost dealer-installed upgrade. A more-powerful, 2.1-amp USB port will be installed, as well, reducing charge times. According to Mazda, the installation should take about two hours. Starting in November, the Mazda6 will come with both phone-mirroring systems pre-installed. When we first drove the refreshed Mazda6 Signature , it impressed us with its luxurious interior and sporty handling, but the ancient infotainment system and lack of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto was a big disappointment. As popular as these systems are with buyers, every new car should at least offer them as an option. This update (mostly) fixes that issue, but sadly, the Mazda6 is currently the only car in Mazda's lineup scheduled to receive it. There's a good chance other models will be added later, but Mazda hasn't announced a timeline for doing so. Source: Mazda

In the final days of WWI a shell-shocked tunneller must lead an Allied team into a hidden German base…100 hundred feet below the trenches. The Germans have lost control of a highly contagious biological weapon that turns its victims into deranged killers. The Allies find themselves trapped underground with hordes of the infected, a rapidly spreading disease and a team of German Stormtroopers dispatched to clean up the mess. The only thing more terrifying than the Western Front… is what lies beneath it. Trench 11 stars Rossif Sutherland (yes, of the Sutherland clan), along with award-winning French Canadian actress Karine Vanasse (The Forbidden Room), Charlie Carrick (Reign), Shaun Benson (Channel Zero), and Ted Atherton (River). The film has been an official selection at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, Screamfest Horror Film Festival, Morbido Film Fest and Cinepocolypse, among others.

The Allies find themselves trapped underground with hordes of the infected, a rapidly spreading disease and a team of German Stormtroopers dispatched to clean up the mess. The only thing more terrifying than the Western Front… is what lies beneath it. Trench 11 stars Rossif Sutherland (yes, of the Sutherland clan), along with award-winning French Canadian actress Karine Vanasse (The Forbidden Room), Charlie Carrick (Reign), Shaun Benson (Channel Zero), and Ted Atherton (River). The film has been an official selection at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, Screamfest Horror Film Festival, Morbido Film Fest and Cinepocolypse, among others.

Here are the key differences between butter vs margarine.	How many times have you confused butter with margarine? Probably more times than you're willing to admit when it comes to the butter vs. margarine debate. The two are actually quite different, though, with very different origins, despite how they're often used interchangeably in cooking and baking. Butter has supposedly been around since 8000 B.C. when a herdsman in what is now Africa discovered that the sheep's milk he had been carrying across rough terrain had curdled into butter. Margarine is much younger, having been invented by French chemist Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès in the 1860s after Napoleon III had announced he was looking for a cheap butter substitute during the Franco-Prussian wars. That's exactly what margarine is today: a substitute to butter. To better understand the difference between butter and margarine, we called on Maryann Walsh MFN, RD, CDE, and Claudia Sidoti , head chef of Hello Fresh , to explain how the two differ and what foods they should be incorporated into for the best results. This way, you'll never be confused about the butter vs. margarine debate ever again. And for more scoop, check out The Difference Between Baking Soda and Baking Powder Every Baker Should Know . What are the main differences between butter and margarine? Butter and margarine are comprised of entirely different ingredients. Sidoti and Walsh both say that butter is made from churning milk or cream, whereas margarine is typically a non-dairy product that's made from oils and emulsifiers. Know that not all kinds of margarine are dairy-free , though, so if lactose is an issue for you, be sure to read the list of ingredients. "The churning process separates butterfat from the buttermilk," explains Sidoti. There are also different kinds of butter. "Butter is typically pale yellow in color, but can also be deep yellow. When butter is labeled 'sweet cream butter,' this means the cream used to make it was pasteurized. Whipped butter adds air into the butter, making it lighter," she says. As for margarine, there really isn't too much variation. "You can find it in stick or tub form. The fat content can range from 10-90 percent," says Sidoti. "Margarine has less cholesterol and saturated fat than butter, but a higher percentage of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats." Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are healthy fats found in vegetable oil and olive oil, respectively. However, there is something you should be mindful of when purchasing margarine. "Some margarine products may still contain trans fats . However, in the next couple of years, product manufacturers are being required to phase out trans fat," says Walsh. The makeup of each is also different. "Margarine does not contain cholesterol because it is not derived from any animal product, so for those watching their cholesterol, margarine may be recommended. However, for those seeking a more natural fat spread or fat for baking, butter holds that title," says Walsh. Are there any dishes where you would use one and not the other? "Butter is hands-down the best for baking," says Sidoti. The chef explains that it's especially good for baking things like pies, biscuits, cake, and cookies because of its high-fat content. Butter is also a better option for frying foods and melted on top of baked potatoes , too. Sidoti rarely uses margarine, but she does say that it's also an option for using in baked goods, especially when you want to achieve a softer texture. However, the fat content is low, which means it may not yield that deliciously rich flavor that we typically associate with butter. Do butter and margarine actually taste different? Yes, they definitely do. "The type of fat found in both is what sets their taste apart," says Sidoti. "Since margarine is made with vegetable oil, the consistency is completely different." This also means that margarine could potentially alter the flavor of a dish. In fact, margarine contains more water than butter, which could result in tougher baked goods and thinner, runny batters that aren't as rich and thick as they would be when made with butter. Now, who's ready to bake up a pie? And speaking of pie, we happen to have the best, most delicious apple pie recipe ever! RELATED VIDEO: Are Brown Eggs Healthier Than White Eggs? (via Buzz60)

BBNT7UF	news	newsscienceandtechnology	The 3 best ways to track your sleep	Track your sleep schedule to improve your sleep hygiene (and your life).	Let's say you fell asleep last night at 11pm and woke at 7am, getting 8 hours of what seems like good rest. So, why are you still tired in the morning? It's probably because you aren't getting sufficient deep sleep to truly restore your body and mind. But instead of guessing how many hours you're getting or wondering if you tossed and turned all night, you can get hard data by tracking your sleep . Let's explore the many ways you can do it. Read more: Proven ways to get better sleep tonight . Use your phone While it's a good idea to leave tech out of the bedroom, if you're like most people, your phone charges on your bedside table as you sleep. It's likely also replaced your alarm clock. If you're already sleeping with your phone, make it work for you by tracking your sleep. Sleep apps There are several apps that use your phone's accelerometer or sonar waves emitted from your phone to detect movement. All you have to do is place your phone on the mattress next to you. Every morning, you'll be able to see how long you slept and how much you moved while sleeping, which can indicate that you're not getting enough restorative deep sleep. Our favorite sleep-tracking apps are SleepScore ( Android and iOS ), Sleep Cycle ( Android and iOS ) and Sleep Time ( Android and iOS ). iPhone The iPhone (and other iOS devices) uses a different approach to measure your sleep. In the Clock app, the Bedtime feature lets you set your bedtime and wake up time. Once set, your phone will alert you when it's time to go to bed to get the amount of sleep you desire. With this feature enabled, your phone pays attention to when you stop using it at night and when you reach for it in the morning to approximate the number of hours you slept. You can see that data in the Sleep Analysis section of the Health app. Though apps are a great way to get started with sleep-tracking, they're not a perfect solution. They can be thwarted by mattress movement (if you sleep with a partner), your phone can fall off the bed, and they can also cause your phone to overheat if it's under sheets and blankets. Fitness trackers To get a better idea of how well you sleep -- how long you're in REM cycle sleep or whether you move around a lot while you're snoozing -- you can use a fitness tracker . Many of these devices already come equipped to track sleep. Several Fitbit models , the Apple Watch , the Motiv Ring and others all track sleep efficiency by measuring your movements throughout the night. Keep in mind, though, that because these devices aren't designed specifically for sleep, it's a good idea to double-check their accuracy. For example, according to a 2012 study ( and a recent lawsuit ), Fitbit's actigraph overestimates sleep by 67 minutes, which is pretty significant. To make sure your fitness tracker isn't over- or underestimating how long you were out, use an app to be safe, or the good old-fashioned method of remembering when you went to sleep. Smart beds and sensors If you are serious about tracking your sleep, try a smart mattress or dedicated sleep sensor, such as the iFit Sleep HR or Eight Sleep Tracker . Sensors fit under or over your existing mattress to track movement, plus heart and respiratory rates. They use that data to tell you how long it takes you to fall asleep and how long you spent in each cycle of sleep throughout the night. Smart mattresses do the same things, but also often include heating and cooling modes and other premium features. Rather than having a fitness tracker pull double duty, the main benefit to a dedicated sleep tracker is accuracy. The secondary benefit is not having to wear a wristband in your sleep or worry about it dying throughout the night. Compile the data Gathering all of this sleep data is only useful if you actually use it. After several nights of tracking your sleep, you'll end up with information on how much "deep" vs. "light" sleep you're getting, how often you move or wake up, time spent in each sleep cycle or -- in some cases -- how much you snore. Unfortunately, most sleep apps and fitness trackers don't give you much advice on how to make changes to your sleep habits based on that data. Here are some causes of common sleep issues: If you're not hitting the number of hours you need: It's time to adjust your bedtime or wake up call. If you're sleeping, but not getting much deep sleep: It could mean your bedroom is too hot or cold, or that you need to cut back on caffeine or alcohol. You might also have underlying sleep conditions , like sleep apnea or insomnia, that you should get checked out by a doctor. If you wake up a lot at night or toss and turn: It could mean you're sleeping too hot, that caffeine or alcohol is interfering with your sleep, or you're dealing with stress. Apps and sensors can help you understand what's happening while you're asleep, but they aren't stand-ins for going to the doctor. If you're waking up exhausted all the time or having trouble staying awake during the day, it's worth getting checked out for any underlying issues. Now that you know how to track your sleep, here are ways your smart home can help you sleep better . Also read how not all sleep tech is actually helping .

Inside the cabin, there's an intuitive infotainment system. However, the rear seats are tight.	The 2015 BMW X1 ranks at the top of the luxury subcompact SUV class. It has robust engine power and handles like a car. Inside the cabin, there's an intuitive infotainment system. However, the rear seats are tight. The 2015 BMW X1 is ranked: #2 in 2015 Luxury Subcompact SUVs #7 in Used Luxury Subcompact SUVs under $30K Is the 2015 BMW X1 a Good Used SUV? The 2015 BMW X1 is a very good luxury subcompact SUV . It offers the best driving dynamics in the class. You'll appreciate the X1's quick acceleration and above-average fuel economy from either of its available engines. While some rivals with sporty handling have rough rides, the X1's smooth suspension keeps occupants comfortable. However, its seats could use more support. The back seats have limited room, but that's typical for a luxury subcompact SUV. The most notable issue with the X1 is its fuel-conserving engine stop-start system. It's slow to act and feels unrefined when pulling away from a stop. Why You Can Trust Us Our used car rankings and reviews are based on our analysis of professional automotive reviews, as well as data like crash test scores, reliability ratings, and ownership expenses. We researched 28 BMW X1 reviews to help you decide if it's the right used car for you.

To ensure our impartiality, our staff never takes expensive gifts or trips from car companies, and an outside team handles the advertising on our site. How Much Is the 2015 BMW X1? There are more than 800 listings for the 2015 BMW X1 on our site, with an average list price of $21,100. Prices range from $16,500 to $25,500, and they vary depending on the vehicle's trim, mileage, location, condition, and features. How Much Does the 2015 BMW X1 Cost to Own? The 2015 BMW X1's five-year estimated costs for gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs come to just over $29,000. That's lower than the estimate for most rival luxury subcompact SUVs. Is It Better to Buy a Used or New BMW X1? The 2019 BMW X1 starts at $31,950, which is quite a bit more than the average price of a 2015 X1. However, there are several advantages to the new model, since BMW redesigned the X1 for 2016. The 2019 model has more space and more advanced available safety features than the 2015. Additionally, the 2019 X1 gained a touch screen and standard navigation, voice control, Apple CarPlay, adaptive cruise control, and forward collision warning. If it's in your budget, choose the 2019 model, which is more-up-to-date than the 2015. There are no new luxury subcompact SUVs that are comparably priced to the 2015 X1. However, if you're willing to consider a nonluxury new subcompact SUV, consider a top-of-the-line 2019 Hyundai Kona for less than the average price of a used 2015 X1. The Kona was named our 2019 Best Subcompact SUV for the Money , and the base trim comes loaded with features like a 7-inch touch screen, two USB ports, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto   most of which are not available in the X1. While the Kona may not be as upscale as the X1, it still has a quality interior, sporty handling, and strong engines. Which Model Year of the BMW X1 Is Best? The 2015 BMW X1 is the final model in the SUV's second generation. It's a fine vehicle, but stepping up to the 2016 X1 is the way to go. This fully redesigned X1 comes with higher-end interior materials, more cabin and cargo space, and standard all-wheel drive, which is available in 2017 and later models. The 2018 model gains a standard rearview camera, but you're also likely to find a 2016 model with a rearview camera. How Reliable Is the 2015 BMW X1? The 2015 X1 has an above-average reliability rating of four out of five from J.D. Power. 2015 BMW X1 Recalls As of this writing, the 2015 BMW X1 has one reported recall. It fixes a faulty driver-side frontal air bag inflator. Be sure this issue is resolved before purchasing a used 2015 X1. See more information on BMW X1 safety recalls » Which Used BMW X1 Model Is Right for Me? The 2015 X1 comes in three trim levels: sDrive28i, xDrive28i, and xDrive35i. The majority of shoppers will be satisfied with either the rear-wheel-drive sDrive28i or the all-wheel-drive xDrive28i. The xDrive35i has a stronger engine than the lower trims, making it a good choice for those who want more power than the base engine offers. Most optional equipment is available in packages, so you may have to shop around for models that come with the safety or technology features you want. The Cold Weather package adds heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. The Premium package adds front-seat lumbar support and leather upholstery. The Technology package adds a navigation system with a larger display and connectivity with a BMW smartphone app. Certified Pre-Owned BMW X1 Warranty BMW offers a CPO program for vehicles five years old or less. The BMW CPO program is available on vehicles with less than 60,000 miles on the odometer. The program covers buyers for one year with unlimited mileage after the expiration of the four-year/50,000-mile new-vehicle limited warranty for passenger cars and SUVs for a maximum of five years of coverage. Each BMW undergoes an inspection before earning CPO status. Additional benefits like towing and roadside assistance may be available. Restrictions apply on transferring certified-pre-owned coverage to subsequent owners. Read the BMW warranty page carefully. BMW doesn't offer nearly as good of a CPO program as other luxury brands. Mercedes, Lexus, and Infiniti all offer superior CPO programs, based on our analysis. How Safe Is the X1? The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2015 BMW X1 its highest safety rating of Good in four crash tests out of five. The X1 received the second-lowest rating of Marginal in the driver-side small overlap front crash test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not provide safety ratings for this model. Rain-sensing windshield wipers come standard in the 2015 X1. The Driver Assistance package adds a rearview camera as well as front and rear parking sensors. Adaptive headlights come standard in the xDrive35i trim. Other luxury subcompact SUVs come standard with these features, and they are available with more, like forward collision warning and blind spot monitoring. 2015 BMW X1 Versus the Competition Which Is Better: 2015 BMW X1 or 2015 Audi Q3? The redesigned 2015 Audi Q3 has a longer standard features than most of its rivals. It includes a panoramic sunroof, leather upholstery, and a satellite radio   all of which are optional in the X1. This Audi is also available with some features that you won't find in the BMW, including parallel park assist, blind spot monitoring, dual-zone automatic climate control, and push-button start. The Q3 has one of the most upscale cabins in the class, and its seats provide more support than the X1's. Additionally, the Audi has class-leading reliability and safety ratings. The only downsides to the Audi Q3 are its harsh ride and inconveniently located climate and infotainment controls. Which Is Better: 2015 BMW X1 or 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class? The 2015 Mercedes GLA-Class and its BMW rival both have carlike handling, strong engines, good gas mileage, and smooth rides. The 2015 GLA is a good option for those who prefer more user-friendly features. However, the X1 provides more space and sharper handling than the GLA. Both are excellent luxury subcompact SUVs , but the X1 will probably cost you less than the GLA. Go with the SUV that best suits your needs. 2015 BMW X1 Performance How Does the 2015 BMW X1 Drive? The 2015 BMW X1's standard powertrain is a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The xDrive35i model comes with a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine. Both engines deliver plenty of power and vigorous acceleration. An eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive are standard; all-wheel drive comes standard in xDrive-designated models. The standard engine stop-start system can be sluggish and harsh. Luckily, the system can be manually disabled. The X1's ride is smooth, and it has carlike handling, thanks to a low center of gravity and a small frame. Models with the M Sport package feature a sport suspension.

Our memory banks are filled with the tastes, smells and packaging of snacks, quick meals, cereals and drinks of decades gone by. From Danish Rings and Swanson TV dinners to Nintendo Cereal and Hubba Bubba Gum, revisit these childhood classics. Radical Eats Snack foods, insta-meals, cereals, and drinks tend to come and go, yet the ones we remember from childhood seem to stick with us   like Jell-O Pudding Pops stuck to our hands as they melted. Children of the 1970s and 1980s had a veritable smorgasbord of ill-conceived and nutritionally suspicious fare to enjoy, and still miss their unusual packaging, unique smells, off-the-wall flavors, and the sheer insanity that went in to conceptualizing them. If this junk food nostalgia isn't enough, there's plenty more to dig into on cereal alone. Hubba Bubba Gum This late 1970s brightly colored bubble gum came in big cubes kids loved, but its popularity faced competition from Bubblicious in the 1980s. The original was discontinued, but Mars bought Wrigley and rebranded it in a tape form.

Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site. Fifty-two children died after being left in hot cars last year. That's the second year in a row with over 50 pediatric vehicular heatstroke deaths, according to NoHeatStroke.org. Parents and others must remain vigilant about the ongoing danger of children and pets dying in hot cars. With many families working from home and practicing social distancing, new tactics will need to be implemented to prevent these tragedies. And as we anticipate that public health measures will remain in place through the summer, it's important to remember that hot car deaths can be a four-season threat in some parts of the country. This year there is a heightened risk of children gaining access to cars and becoming trapped inside. Parents working from home while also managing distance learning will need to be extra mindful to keep vehicles locked in the garage or driveway and keys out of children's reach. If your child is missing, always remember to first check your pool, if you have one, and your vehicle, including the trunk. Social distancing restrictions at grocery stores may tempt parents to leave their child in the car to decrease the child's risk of exposure while they shop. However, even with the window cracked or the vehicle parked in the shade, the interior temperatures within the car can reach dangerous levels in a short period of time. It's never safe to leave a child unattended in a vehicle. The first pediatric heatstroke death of 2020 happened on April 25 in Tomball, Texas. A 4-year-old boy was found dead inside the hot family vehicle after sneaking outside and into the car unnoticed. The outside temperature was only 78° F. Even on days with mild temperatures, the heat inside a closed vehicle can reach dangerous levels within an hour, posing major health risks to small children or pets left inside, Consumer Reports says. CR testing showed that even when it was 61° F outside, the temperature inside a closed car reached more than 105° F in just 1 hour, an extremely dangerous and potentially fatal level for a child. The CR test results help dispel the myth that hot-car deaths or heatstroke happen only on blisteringly hot days in the dead of summer. And the idea that your car's color can significantly mitigate the heat inside the vehicle is also largely a myth, CR found in its testing. "Children should never be left unattended in a car for even a short period of time," says Jennifer Stockburger, director of operations at CR's Auto Test Center. "Even when it's not that hot outside, our test results show how quickly temperatures inside the car escalate, regardless of whether your car is light or dark." And research shows that drivers shouldn't rely on shade to provide enough cooling power, either. Researchers at Arizona State University and the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine evaluated cabin air temperature and surface temperatures in identical vehicles placed in the shade and the sun. The study estimates that in a shaded vehicle, a 2-year-old child's core temperature could reach a dangerous and potentially deadly 104° F in a little less than 2 hours. Heatstroke is the leading cause of deaths in vehicles (excluding crashes) for children 14 and younger. Since 1998, an average of 39 children have died each year in the U.S. of vehicular heatstroke. The danger from high temperatures is particularly acute for young children because their bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults' bodies, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). That's because young children, especially babies, lack the ability to efficiently regulate their body temperature. Children dehydrate more quickly than adults. Some automakers have begun integrating alert technology into vehicles. The features are designed to remind parents or guardians that they might be leaving a child or pet behind in a vehicle. Our Findings Consumer Reports conducted several temperature tests inside closed vehicles at CR's Auto Test Track in Colchester, Conn., to better understand how rapidly rising cabin temperatures can become unsafe. The experiments were conducted with precision instruments. On a June day, when it averaged 61° F outside during the first hour of testing, the inside of a parked car reached more than 105° F. On a July day, when it averaged 78° F outside during a 1-hour test period, the inside of a lighter-colored sedan reached more than 104° F. And during the same 1-hour test period, the inside of a dark-colored sedan reached more than 109° F. CR reported the readings at the end of an hour. But interior temperatures continued to rise as more time passed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has warned that on a 60° F day something akin to spring weather the temperature inside a vehicle can reach a dangerous 110° F over the course of several hours. The threshold for heatstroke in children is when the internal body temperature reaches about 104° F. And a child is at serious risk of death if his or her internal body temperature reaches 107° F, according to medical experts. The risk is year-round in some regions with mild winters, including the South and Southwest. In May 2017, 5-month-old Kyrae Vineyard died from heatstroke after being left in a car for about 4 hours in Caldwell, Idaho, according to news reports. The high temperature there that day was 76° F. And 9-month-old Bryce Balfour died from heatstroke March 30, 2007, after he was left inside a vehicle on a 66° F day in Charlottesville, Va. His story was posted on the NHTSA website as a cautionary tale. Car Color and Temperature The chart below demonstrates the rise in vehicle cabin temperature when CR tested the two sedans on a July day. Why Cars Heat Up Closed cars can get superhot quickly because sunlight heats up elements inside, such as the dash, upholstery, steering wheel, and more, according to NoHeatStroke.org. Those elements radiate their heat into the air, increasing the ambient temperature inside the car. Why don't cracked windows help enough? Partially opened windows do allow some heat to escape, says Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, but as long as the heat source (the sun) continues to beat down and heat up the inside car elements, the temperature can stay dangerously high. Preventive Measures Vehicle manufacturers have begun integrating technology aimed at preventing child heatstroke. GM's Rear Seat Reminder , implemented in a number of models since 2017, notes whether a rear door was opened within 10 minutes of the vehicle being turned on or anytime after the vehicle has been turned on. Nissan developed a feature similar to GM's, called the Rear Door Alert . Standard on the 2018 Nissan Pathfinder (with plans to roll it out on all four-door models by 2022), this system shows a warning in the instrument cluster and honks the horn if it detects that a rear door was opened before a trip and not opened again after the trip was completed. The driver can choose to limit the warning to just the display or to disable it altogether if it doesn't suit his or her needs. Hyundai's Rear Occupant Alert feature goes a step further than the systems used by GM or Nissan because it incorporates motion detection. This system displays a warning in the driver's gauge cluster after the engine is turned off. The warning reminds the driver to check the rear seat if either rear door had been opened before or during the trip. If the warning is ignored and the vehicle is locked, the rear cabin's ultrasonic sensor will detect motion for up to 24 hours. If motion is detected, the vehicle will honk for 25 seconds and send an email or a text to the owners if they are Blue Link subscribers. So far, the feature is available in the 2020 Kia Telluride and the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe. (Kia and Hyundai, based in South Korea, are run as separate business units, but they share a corporate parent and their cars often share parts, design, and engineering.) Toyota added a rear-seat reminder to the 2020 Highlander . It operates with door logic, checking to determine whether a rear door has been opened before or during a trip and reminding the driver to check the backseat with a visual and audible alert in the driver cluster at the end of the trip. See our guide to rear-seat reminder systems for a full listing of all vehicles that have these integrated technologies available. CR's Take Consumer Reports believes that automakers should create integrated features that remind parents to check for children in the backseat, and get the technology into as many models as they can, as soon as they can. Aftermarket products can fall short because they still depend on parents recognizing the risk and taking some sort of action. Parents rarely plan for the risk that they might forget their children in a car, and so many of them fail to act. Consumer Reports has called on lawmakers in Congress to support the Hot Cars Act of 2019, bipartisan legislation introduced last year in both the House and Senate that would require all new passenger vehicles in the U.S. to come with standard equipment designed to help prevent child deaths from heatstroke suffered in motor vehicles. "The good news is that the technology to prevent these tragedies is available," said Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "That's why we strongly urge Congress to pass the Hot Cars Act without delay, to provide parents with a simple, integrated, and reliable way to help prevent forgetting their child in the back seat when they get out of the car." General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai have demonstrated that integrated preventative solutions are possible, even if they haven't been perfected. CR will continue to evaluate those and other technologies as they emerge, and will advocate for the widespread adoption of simple, reliable, and effective backseat occupant alerts to be integrated in all new vehicles, says David Friedman, vice president of advocacy at Consumer Reports. The AAP also endorses the integrated approach. "Having something that is in the vehicle that is a default, that you would have to opt out of, is the right way to go about it," says Elizabeth Murray, D.O., an AAP spokeswoman. "These are not people making malicious decisions to try to hurt their children. These are terrible accidents that are happening, so if we can make it default to take any human error out of it, then that is the right decision."

AABQDiu	health	nutrition	The Truth About Green Tea and Weight Loss	You might want to get some water boiling.	Green tea aficionados are always cooing about how they love the taste from refreshing to grassy, to smoky and the refreshing color of the tea. And some scientists, wellness, and weight loss experts suggest it can even help you lose weight. So can this plant-based beverage help you drop pounds? Research in humans and animals points to a resounding "sort of." But before we look into what that means, take a look at what green tea actually is. It's made from the same plant species as black tea, it's just processed differently. And as you've likely already noticed, there are many variations in green tea flavors. So if you've tried it once and didn't love it, a different brand may give you a completely different flavor experience. And while there are no guarantees it can drop pounds (of course, it can help you achieve a healthy weight if you're drinking it in place of sugary sodas or sugared-up coffee drinks), here's why it just might help a bit: There's evidence that green tea can help you lose weight A number of small but respectable clinical trials have found that overweight people who had green tea either in drinkable form or in extract form lost more weight than people who didn't have any. Science being science, there are also a few studies that showed no benefit from green tea drinks or supplements. Overall, "I would say it may assist modestly," says Kristin Kirkpatrick, R.D.N., consultant for Integrative and Lifestyle Medicine for the Cleveland Clinic. In studies that found a weight-loss benefit in green tea, there was a "trend toward weight loss" or tea drinkers lost "significantly" more. But it's not usually a total transformation. One small study conducted at Oklahoma State University, for instance, found that people who drank green tea or took green tea extract lost about 1.3 pounds more over 8 weeks than people who drank water. Some studies suggest even decaf green tea may have a benefit. Green tea may even help you lose belly fat An older study found that among people who ate regularly and exercised 180 minutes a week, those who drank a beverage containing catechins, the most biologically active compounds in green tea, had a greater percentage change in abdominal fat (belly fat) than did people who got a drink with no catechins. Why it might work There are a number of theories on why green tea especially the main catechin called epigallocatechin gallate might help you out a bit if you're looking to lose weight. "It's possible that catechins in green tea may actually inhibit carbohydrate digestion and absorption," Kirkpatrick says, citing a report in the journal Scientific Reports that showed lower carb absorption after people downed a green tea extract. "I think some of the most promising ones are looking at green tea's effects on the microbiome," she says. Research is increasingly finding that green tea alters the gut's microbiome, and those changes could be what makes it helpful for dropping pounds. There may even be some evidence that black tea can contribute to weight loss as well. Matcha may help weight and belly fat, too Kirkpatrick gets a lot of questions from her clients on whether trendy matcha  the powdered version of green tea is as helpful as the green tea leaves that come in teabags or as loose tea. "There haven't been a ton of studies on matcha alone," she says. But adds that it's reasonable to think it's just as useful, as green tea is made of the leaves of the plant, and matcha is made of the ground-up plants. While numerous studies have looked at green tea extracts taken as supplements, Kirkpatrick urges people to get their green tea from the actual tea itself; "in the most whole form possible." Beyond the weight loss benefits of green tea There are more reasons than weight to drink green tea. Kirkpatrick points out the "impressive benefits being found regarding green tea and the prevention of cancer." And then there are benefits in possibly preventing heart disease, potential memory benefits and other health boosters in the green stuff. "Weight loss is so multifaceted; green tea is not going to guarantee weight loss," Kirkpatrick says. But go ahead and drink up as long as you're not sipping on a sugared-up version of the stuff, if green tea doesn't interfere with any medications you're taking, and as long as you're not looking for it to be a weight-loss panacea.

From dark chocolate to salmon to vibrant berries, these foods are full of flavor and age-reversing nutrients. Flaxseeds Flaxseeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fats for a sharp mind and healthy heart . Plus, they're great for your gut. "As we age, it's more important to eat the right foods to keep your gut health in check," says Mirkin. "Flaxseeds are loaded with fiber for long-term digestive health." Just be sure to use ground flaxseeds or grind whole ones; your body digests and absorbs the nutrients from ground flaxseeds better than whole ones. Try it: Toss some over these filling breakfast bowls . Wild salmon Fatty fish, like salmon, are rich in omega-3s and a good source of lean protein . And while fat has more than double the calories of protein and carbohydrates, it is key to keeping your cravings in check. "Salmon is not only satisfying and delicious, but it will also make your skin glow, reduce your risk of disease, and even curb your hunger," Mirkin says. Try it: Salmon Salad with Avocado and Sweet Grape Tomatoes Avocados Packed with healthy fats, avocados can help keep your skin plump, nourish your hair , and help lower blood pressure , thanks to their decent potassium content. "Although avocados are very high in fat, they are linked with weight loss because they are so satisfying," says Mirkin. Try it: Shrimp, Avocado, and Egg Chopped Salad from Fill Your Plate, Lose The Weight Nuts Nuts make a filling snack that promotes weight loss because they're high in fiber, healthy fats, and protein. Bonus: The nutrients in nuts help reduce your risk of chronic conditions, like diabetes and heart disease , says Mirkin. Try it: These cherry chocolate granola bars pack a double dose of nuts with almond butter and chopped almonds. Watercress Shake up your go-to salad with this peppery leafy green while keeping your skin glowing in the process. "It's packed with water, vitamin C , vitamin A , and antioxidants that kill free radicals," Mirkin says, one of the main aggressors of premature skin damage. Try it: Cucumber and Melon Salad with Watercress, Herbs, and Feta Sauerkraut Made from fermented cabbage, this tangy condiment is packed with gut-boosting probiotics  a.k.a. good bacteria making it a nutritional must-have for women over 40. Research shows that these that healthy bugs may improve your immune function , mood , digestive system , and even your skin . Try it: Chicken Reuben Quesadillas With Sauerkraut Dark chocolate Chocolate may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to better nutrition after 40, but this after-dinner indulgence can actually do wonders for your health. "Dark chocolate is rich in flavonols, which protect your heart, reduce the risk of diabetes, and lower blood pressure , " Mirkin says. Stick to chocolate bars that contain at least 70% cocoa and less than 6 grams of added sugar to get the most nutritional bang out of every serving. Try it: 13 Healthy Dark Chocolate Bars That Aren't Sugar Bombs Dark Leafy Greens "Dark leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and mustard greens, contain high amounts of vitamin K , lutein, folate , calcium , and beta carotene, which can preserve memory functioning," says Mirkin. Try it: Add a handful of greens to one of these high-protein smoothie recipes for a nutrition boost. Berries Berries will naturally brighten your dish and supply hunger-curbing fiber to satisfy sweet cravings. Their gem-like hues are a great indicator of their nutrient concentration. "Dark pigmentation and rich color means the berries are high in disease-fighting antioxidants and phytochemicals," Mirkin explains. Try it: 6 Creative (and Delicious) Ways to Eat More Berries Garlic Garlic is a serious wellness wonder, especially for women over 40. "Studies suggest that garlic can minimize bone loss by increasing estrogen levels. It is also nutrient-rich with very few calories and adds flavor to foods so you're satisfied with less," Mirkin says. Try it: Creamy Roasted Garlic Soup Edamame Edamame packs 9 grams of muscle-building plant protein in just ½ cup for less than 100 calories. These versatile soybeans are also a great source of folate (vitamin B9), iron , vitamins C and A, and potassium for your heart. Try it: Roast some with flaky sea salt or perk up your favorite pasta dish with a handful (we love this lemony shells with edamame recipe ). Greek Yogurt Keep your bones strong with a serving of rich and creamy Greek yogurt every day. "It's an excellent source of calcium and contains almost no sodium," Mirkin says. Greek yogurt packs more protein and has a thicker consistency than other yogurts, so it's the perfect snack for keeping you full and energized. Plus, it has active cultures that support gut health. Try it: Enjoy Greek yogurt in these overnight oats recipes, or try it at dinner with these spice-roasted carrots and parsnips . Extra virgin olive oil Is there anything more delicious than EVOO drizzled over warm, crusty bread? A staple of the Mediterranean diet , olive oil is rich in unsaturated fats that have anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties to promote longevity and optimal heart health. Try it: Use a healthy dose of olive in these delicious homemade salad dressing recipes . Eggs Any way you scramble it, eggs are a nutritional multitasker. They contain vitamin D for bone health, choline for brain function, and protein for preserving muscle. Mirkin suggests scrambling one egg with three egg whites for a slimming and filling breakfast. "The high fat and protein content (plus lack of carbohydrates and sugars) in eggs makes them an excellent choice for women over 40," says Mirkin. Try it: Need meal prep ideas? Try these delicious breakfast egg muffins . Chia seeds Chia seeds may be tiny, but they're mighty with filling fiber, omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium for healthy bones, and complete plant-based protein . Because they absorb water so well, downing chia is also thought to help boost your satiety. Try it: Vanilla Chia Seed Pudding Onions Despite their translucent appearance, onions are dense in vital nutrients. "They are high in the protective antioxidant vitamin C , B vitamins for a healthy metabolism, and potassium for stable blood pressure levels," Mirkin says. Try it: Prep some caramelized onions in advance to add to sandwiches, stir-fries, salads, and soups for a burst of flavor. Carrots Carrots are packed with beta carotene (the pigment responsible for their vibrant hue), which is converted into vitamin A a superstar nutrient that supports immunity and boosts eye health. "In your 40s, it's more important than ever to eat more vitamin A-rich foods , because they also protect your eyes from cataracts," Mirkin. Carrots are also high in potassium to stabilize blood pressure, fiber for better digestion, and vitamin K for bone health. Try it: Spice-Roasted Carrots and Parsnips with Yogurt and Turmeric Vinaigrette Broccoli Broccoli is chock-full of antioxidants, phytonutrients, and vitamins C, B6, and A all of which Mirkin says can help stave off chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's as you age. Plus, you'll get tons of healthy fiber for better digestion. Try it: If you're not too keen on the taste of broccoli, try blending it with stronger flavors, like we did in this herbed broccoli cauliflower soup recipe . Chicken There's a reason chicken has become a weight loss staple: It packs roughly 25 grams of protein in just 4 ounces (or about the size of your palm). It's also fairly low and fat in calories, making it a leaner choice that most red meats . Try it: 25 High-Protein Chicken Recipes for Weight Loss Bell peppers Believe it or not, all bell peppers contain more vitamin C than an orange , an antioxidant that's thought to boost immunity and promote collagen production. Any color will do, but red is the sweetest if you prefer your crunchy snack to be less bitter. Try it: Baby Bok Choy with Shiitake Mushrooms and Red Bell Peppers Beans Beans are loaded with fiber to keep your blood sugar stable, along with folate and iron . Get even more out of this vegetarian protein source by choosing darker varieties (like kidney or black beans), which have higher concentrations of antioxidants and phytonutrients. Try it: Healthy Black Bean Burgers Quinoa Quinoa is a complete plant protein and serves up a whopping 8 grams per 1-cup serving! The fluffy grain also offers tons of gut-healthy fiber to keep you feeling satisfied. Bonus: It cooks up faster than brown rice and barley. Try it: Honey-Spiced Salmon with Quinoa Basil Basil is loaded with polyphenols, which are beneficial in soothing chronic pain associated with arthritis , and even help protect your liver, brain, and heart, according to Mirkin. Try it: Perk up your salad or pasta dish with a sprinkle of minced basil, or whip up some strawberry pesto to spread on a sandwich. Ginger root Just one teaspoon of ginger per week can improve your artery function, says Mirkin. Studies also show the fragrant root (often when taken in supplement form) may also help prevent diabetes , ease menstrual and muscle pain, and possibly even ward off obesity. If you're prone to tummy troubles, it's also a great natural remedy for nausea and other digestive issues. Try it: Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Herbal Tea Sweet potatoes These bright orange tubers fall under the healthy carb category . That's because sweet potatoes pack tons of gut-filling fiber, magnesium, heart-healthy potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin A. Eat them roasted, baked, or boiled in salads, as fries, or in soups. Try it: Maple-Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges Tomatoes Juicy tomatoes are amazing in salsas, sauces, salads, and sandwiches. And they're nutritional superstars, too. Red tomatoes, in particular, are rich in lycopene , a carotenoid that may help reduce your risk of chronic diseases. The tangy fruits are also low in calories but high in potassium, zinc, and vitamin C. Try it: Sautéed Cherry Tomatoes and White Beans Mushrooms One study found that mushrooms contain much higher amounts of two important antioxidants than most other foods: ergothioneine (ERGO) and glutathione (GSH). ERGO, in particular, is known to mitigate oxidative stress, a process that plays a role in aging and diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. They're also one of the few food sources of vitamin D. Try it: Farro and Wild Mushroom Dressing Oregano This powerful green herb is "rich in antioxidants that fight free radical damage," says Mirkin, potentially helping to stave off disease-causing inflammation. Try it: Sprinkle this subtly sweet Italian staple on everything from salads to pastas. Citrus fruits Oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, and the like boast tons of antioxidants, fiber, vitamin C, and other nutrients that research shows can boost your brain health, aid weight loss, protect your heart, and keep your skin looking radiant. Try it: Lentil and Steak Salad With Grapefruit Nutritional yeast This vegan staple packs a powerful combination of nutrients. "Just 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast offers a whopping 8 grams of protein to keep you satisfied with minimal calories," says Mirkin. It's also a great source of B vitamins something that many vegetarians tend to be deficient in. With a cheesy, nutty flavor, nutritional yeast makes a great dairy-free substitute for cheese in pasta, pizza, and salads. Try it: Mirkin suggests sneaking in a serving with this protein-packed veggie burger recipe .

AAAZ5xA	tv	tvnews	'Dead to Me' Season 2 Is Officially Coming Back to Netflix in May	The new teaser is SO good! 🙌	It's time for Dead to Me season 2! But first, a refresher on season 1: Dead to Me follows Jen (played by Christina Applegate ) as she grieves the loss of her husband. While attending a grief support group, she meets Judy ( Linda Cardellini ), and the two women quickly bond. Jen even goes so far as to invite Judy to live at her home with her family   and then alllllll sorts of secrets start to come out. The Netflix show is emotional, witty, and edgy, and it's been met with all kinds of positive reviews from casual viewers and critics alike . Now that Dead to Me season 2 will soon be available, here's a look at everything we know about the future of the acclaimed show so far. (Just beware: There are some major season 1 spoilers ahead.) What is the Dead to Me season 2 return date? On April 10, Netflix revealed that the show is coming back to the streaming service on Friday, May 8. Who in the Dead to Me cast will return for season 2? During the June 3 FYSee panel, Netflix confirmed that Christina and Linda have both signed on for Dead to Me season 2. And that makes sense: Their character's storylines are   obviously   central to the show. In fact, filming wrapped up months ago, according to a December 2019 Instagram post from Linda . What's more, Variety reported that Natalie Morales (the actress, not the Today show star) will be joining the hit series as a recurring character named Michelle. According to the outlet, Michelle is described as "wry and down to earth" and has a "relaxed charm and infectious wit." She forms a connection with Judy at the assisted living facility where Michelle's difficult mother lives. Will Steve ( James Marsden ) be back for season 2? Judging by the trailer, it looks like it! Are there any Dead to Me spoilers for season 2 yet? Season 1 ends with what many fans have called a serious cliffhanger: After finding out that Judy was responsible for her husband's death, Jen is found standing over the body of Steve   a.k.a. Judy's ex-fiancé   with a gun in hand. Yikes. Last May, the show's creator, Liz Feldman , wasn't sure whether Netflix would grant her a season 2. But she did already have some thoughts about where the show would go next. "I'll just say that you don't know that [Jen] shot [Steve]," she told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. "Just like the rest of the show, it's not exactly what you think it's going to be." In general, though, it sounds like we can expect to see more of the dark humor and complex friendship dynamic between Jen and Judy that we came to love in Dead to Me season 1: "What I will say is that [season 2] will be about the further exploration of this friendship ... between these two women," Liz later told Entertainment Weekly . "In the most basic way, the score has been evened. What I wanted to do was create a situation where they're forced together, and they need each other now in some ways more than they did at the beginning of season 1." And, according to Christina, season 2 will bring the drama. "We've had some stuff in season 2 that is the most intense [stuff] I've ever had to do as an actor in my life, with [Linda]," Applegate told the Los Angeles Times .

AABG8UE	health	weightloss	Jillian Michaels Says Ditch These Foods and Do This Workout to Say Goodbye to Belly Fat	Belly fat isn't just an annoyance; it has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.	Belly fat isn't just an annoyance; it has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Jillian Michaels Says Ditch These Foods and Do This Workout to Say Goodbye to Belly Fat Belly fat isn't just an annoyance; it has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes . But don't worry, there are ways to improve your health and simultaneously reduce the weight around your stomach. We asked celebrity trainer Jillian Michaels , creator of the award-winning My Fitness by Jillian Michaels app , to share her top tips for reducing belly fat . Click through the slideshow above to learn more. COVID-19 Symptoms Survey Help researchers at the Regenstrief Institute track the outbreak Go to the survey Reduce Your Overall Body Fat Percentage While doing ab exercises like crunches will strengthen your abs, they won't reduce belly fat because you can't spot-reduce fat from certain areas of your body. " Reducing overall body fat will help you decrease belly fat " in order to see your abs pop, Jillian said. Do this through a combination of diet and exercise. For more tips on how to lose body fat, check out these nine tips from experts . Eat Clean and Limit These 4 Ingredients One piece of the puzzle that's necessary to reduce overall body fat (in order to lose belly fat) is to focus on your diet. Jillian said a clean, calorie-controlled diet is important for reducing belly fat, and be careful not to overeat. Make sure your diet is low in processed sugars and flours . " Don't drink too much alcohol ," she advised. "Really try to bring this to four drinks a week, tops." Jillian also said to keep sodium intake down in order to avoid water retention, and make sure to drink plenty of water to help reduce water weight. Do This Kind of Exercise We asked Jillian what type of exercise is the most effective for reducing overall body fat, and she said the exercises that burn more calories, and therefore burn more stored fat, are HIIT , resistance training, functional fitness (exercises that incorporate multiple muscle groups), and circuit training. Jillian went on to explain that while you're working hard to burn overall body fat , you'll want to condition the muscles underneath the fat so when you lose that top layer, your tummy will be toned. She recommended doing "functional exercises like push-ups , mountain climbers, planks, lunges with chop (torso rotation), etc." These moves all "burn calories and condition your core." Prioritize Sleep "I also recommend prioritizing sleep," Jillian said. Sleep and weight gain are closely linked since a lack of sleep will raise cortisol levels (your stress hormone), as well as grehlin (the hunger hormone), and increase cravings, which will prompt you to eat more. A lack of sleep will also make you too tired to get up for that early morning workout or have the energy to push hard if you do make it to the gym. Plus, a lack of sleep makes you want to eat more and is more likely to give into you junk food cravings . Jillian said to aim to get between seven and nine hours nightly, or whatever you feel your body needs.
AAB69ip	health	medical	This Is Why You Should Never Use Hand Sanitizer	When it comes to washing your hands, consider the downsides of hand sanitizer before you opt for a bottle of the stuff over a trip to the sink.	Germaphobes rarely leave the house without their bottle of hand sanitizer in tow and it's easy to see why: Virtually everything we touch on a daily basis is teeming with bacteria. In fact, one 2017 study published in the journal Germs assessed 27 cell phones and found a median of 17,000 bacterial gene copies per phone . And while hand sanitizer may seem like an effective on-the-go solution for ridding yourself of germs , using it too frequently can do more harm than good. Actually, it's because hand sanitizer is so effective at killing bacteria that it's not ideal for everyday use. Triclosan, or TCS, is the active ingredient in some hand sanitizers. And while this ingredient does effectively strip away a myriad of microbes, one 2018 study published in the journal Environment International found that it's just as successful at spurring the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Just 30 days of exposure to 0.2mg/L TCS can cause multi-drug resistance to E. coli . "The triclosan found in personal care products that we use daily is accelerating the spread of antibiotic resistance," study author Jianhua Guo explained in a press release . So what about hand sanitizers that count ethyl alcohol, rather than triclosan, as their active ingredient (which is most hand sanitizers)? While these are the most potent sanitizers on the market and are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , alcohol-based hand sanitizers have some serious downsides as well. "Repeated use of anything, including hand sanitizer, can cause chronic irritation, skin breakdown, and damage," says Trevan Fischer , MD , surgical oncologist and assistant professor of surgical oncology at John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. "If you're using very high concentrations of alcohol, it can cause dryness and cracks in the skin . Not only does it not feel good when the alcohol hits the skin, but then the skin won't heal as well," says Fischer. That's why it's especially important not to use alcohol-based sanitizers on injured skin. Additionally, Fischer points to alcohol's ability to kill off beneficial bacteria on the skin's surface as a potential source of harm. "If you're beating down a natural defense the body has, you could be causing some chronic risk over time," he says. That's not the only problem with overusing alcohol-based sanitizers, however: Per one 2008 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology , the topical application of ethyl alcohol can "lower the skin barrier function and render the membrane more permeable" to harmful chemicals like nitrosamines from cosmetics. Though there are numerous downsides to using both triclosan- and alcohol-based sanitizers, none of this is to say that you can't use these products every once in a while. Yes, washing your hands with soap and water removes debris that hand sanitizer leaves behind (including allergens like peanut proteins) with the fewest side effects. But if you're in a pinch and need to get rid of germs ASAP, then it's A-OK to use an emergency bottle of hand sanitizer. According to a 2004 study published in Clinical Microbiology Reviews , the sanitizer capable of killing the broadest range of pathogens contains 60 to 85 percent ethanol or 60 to 80 percent isopropanol or n-propanol. However, if you want to avoid the skin-damaging effects of alcohol-based sanitizers, you can always use an alcohol-free option, like Germ-X's Alcohol-Free Foaming Sanitizer . Be forewarned, though: While alcohol-free hand sanitizers are largely effective, they are slightly less potent than their alcohol-based counterparts.

BBMEtDi	finance	finance-saving-investing	3 forces pushing stock prices higher	Potential headwinds abound, but Wall Street keeps setting new record highs as investors focus on the positives	U.S. stocks have been on a roll, setting repeated new record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The Dow Jones industrials index has been the laggard, weighed down by losses in trade-sensitive names like Boeing. However, it's still within 2 percent of its Jan. 26 peak, and it seems likely to cross that mark any day now. Stock index futures on Thursday morning were down slightly after four straight days of gains on the major indexes, but at this point, August seems sure to be another month of rising stock prices -- the fifth in a row for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and the second for the Dow Jones industrials. This is already the longest bull market ever , and the current U.S. economic expansion is also one of the longest in history. Yet nagging concerns remain, from the specter of political shenanigans (impeachment?) looming after Election Day to the deepening trade rift between the U.S. and China. But equity investors apparently couldn't care less. Here are three reasons for their enduring optimism: Share buybacks and dividends Corporate earnings growth has been strong. Credit has been cheap. And CEOs and other executives often have their compensation tied to things like earnings per share and share price performance. With mergers and acquisitions looking uncertain (given high prices for potential targets) and hiring/investment spending risky, many businesses have opted instead to buy back their own shares, helping boost their own stock prices and earnings-per-share measures. Since the start of the current bull market in the first quarter of 2009, S&P 500 companies have repurchased $4.1 trillion worth of their own shares, according to Yardeni Research. Over this time, corporations paid $2.9 trillion in dividends. In 2018's first quarter, the sum of the two was running at a $1.2 trillion annual rate -- a record level -- boosted by the corporate tax cuts delivered by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. Given this level of stock buybacks, the number of S&P 500 shares outstanding has fallen 3.3 percent from the middle of 2006 through the end of 2017 and is 7.7 percent lower from the post-crisis high of early 2011. Related video: What drove 'bull market' to record stampede? Earnings and revenues That smaller share count is pushing S&P 500 earnings per share ever deeper into record territory. Analysts are looking earnings per share of $172.95 on a forward basis, representing year-over-year EPS growth well in excess of 20 percent. Revenues jumped 10.3 percent over the previous year's last quarter, also to a new record high. Yardeni Research noted that normally this far into an economic expansion, something between 4 percent and 6 percent growth is more typical. Profit margins are also at an all-time high, with the S&P 500 corporate margins sitting at 10.9 percent vs. 10.1 percent at the end of 2017. Skeptics still on the sidelines One of the bigger reasons for share price gains this year has been a "short squeeze" dynamic following the nasty sell-off in February, after which many hedge funds and other professional investors took big bets that stocks would keep falling, known as short positions. But as stock prices melted higher instead, those short positions have been squeezed and then closed as investors who bet on a continued fall are forced to purchase stocks to get out of those money-losing positions. Ironically, on days when stocks push to new records, the most hated shares by hedge fund types are leading the way. According to Goldman Sachs, a basket of 50 stocks in the Russell 3000 index with market capitalizations more of than $1 billion and the largest outstanding short interest have outperformed the S&P 500 by 14 percent so far this year. High-flying big-cap technology stocks like Amazon, which flirted with a share price of $2,000 on Wednesday after an upgrade by Morgan Stanley analysts, sit at the center of this dynamic. Yet they just keep rising, with Amazon alone responsible for nearly a quarter of the Nasdaq's 1,000-point climb from 7,000 to 8,000 earlier this month. The more these stocks just refuse to decline, the more the skeptics are forced to buy in -- perpetuating the cycle. Read more from Anthony Mirhaydari and other top money experts

BBMoFtL	entertainment	celebrity	34 Celebrity Couples Who Found Love After Being Set Up by Friends	A blind date sounds pretty good right about now.	A blind date sounds pretty good right about now. They say that the best way to meet someone is through friends. And if your friends' friends just so happen to be very famous and good looking, well then, we're all in. The celebrity couples ahead met because they were introduced by a mutual acquaintance or set up on a blind date. Some knew it was love at first sight...others needed a little time to get there. Either way, it just proves, hey, it could happen to you. Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher The GRAMMY-winning country singer met her NHL player husband after they were set up on a blind date by friends...despite the fact they lived in different countries at the time. "I mean, can I make dating more difficult?" Underwood said on VH1's Behind the Music . "Let's get a hockey guy who lives in another country. Awesome." It worked out, and the couple married in 2010 and have two children together. Amy Schumer and Chris Fischer The comedian met Fischer through her assistant, Molly, who is actually Fischer's sister, so she's basically employee of the year. Fischer is an award-winning chef who has served food for none other than the Obamas and Jake Gyllenhaal. On one vacation to Martha's Vineyard, Molly suggested that her brother should pop on by Schumer's vacation house to cook for her, and the rest is history. Jon Stewart and Tracey McShane The former host of The Daily Show and his wife were set up by a production assistant on Stewart's film Wishful Thinking . When Stewart decided to propose, he called on New York Times crossword puzzle editor, Will Shortz, to help him create a crossword puzzle that would feature clues that would lead towards the marriage proposal. Awwww. They've been married since 2000 and have two children together. Tamera Mowry-Housley and Adam Housley The Sister, Sister actress met her husband through their economics professor, Robert Sexton, at Pepperdine University. Housley noticed Mowry on the photo wall of Sexton's favorite students near his desk. "Tia was on the wall too, my twin, but he pointed to my picture," Mowry said to Yahoo! . At the time, she was focused on her career and told the professor to give Housley her email. She wasn't interested in a relationship and thought it would be easier to let the potential suitor down virtually. Her mind soon changed, though, when she received Housley's email. "I always say, 'He got me with his words,'" Mowry has said. They married in 2011 and have two children together. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas We actually can't believe it either, but this couple was introduced by Danny DeVito in 1998. Douglas recalls the night he met his future wife: "I found out that [we share the same birthday] the first night I met her and after she told me that and after she told me she loved golf, I told her, 'I'm going to be the father of your children' and then she said 'Goodnight.'" Obviously, it worked out because the couple has been together for more than 20 years and have two children. Ali Wentworth and George Stephanopoulos The comedian met the former White House Communications Director after a friend suggested she go out to lunch with him. Wentworth described the set-up on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in 2017 like this: "I had a birthday party, all girls, and everyone said, 'You know, you have to start dating, Ali.' And I said, 'You know what, I live in L.A., it's either agents or actors. I'm not interested.' And one of them said, 'You should go out with my old boyfriend, George Stephanopoulos.' And I said, 'No thank you.'" Eventually, Wentworth agreed to the meet-up but not without a fight. She showed up to the lunch without showering, legs unshaved (power to you!), and in a black suit. "I came in. We sat down; we both ordered the crab salad. And, I'm telling you, by the end of lunch, [it was] done. We were engaged two months later. Married six months later," she said on the talk show. Katie Couric and John Molner In 2012, Couric was single and was looking to date again, so she asked a friend to set her up. "I asked a friend of mine, Molly, whose husband is a trauma surgeon if her husband knew any other doctors because I thought I'd like to go out with a doctor," she told PEOPLE. "And so she thought about it, and she said, 'We don't really know a doctor, but we do know this banker named John Molner.' And I said, 'Does he have a pulse?'" Molner took a while to call, but when he did, they met at a restaurant. Couric says of their first meeting, "He had me at hello." The pair married June 2014 at her private home in the Hamptons. Kelly Clarkson and Brandon Blackstock The Voice judge and American Idol winner met her husband since 2013 through her manager, who is Blackstock's father. She'd known him for several years before they got together. It wasn't until Clarkson's performance at the 2012 Super Bowl when she found out he was no longer married that things became romantic. "Brandon is my manager's son. I've known him for six years, but he was married for most of that time," she said to the Daily Mail . "Then, suddenly, there he was at the Super Bowl, and he was single." Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel J & J had a mutual friend that made the intro which led to their love. The pair met in 2007, both fresh out of other relationships (Biel with Chris Evans and Timberlake with Cameron Diaz) and not looking for anything serious. "There was nothing starry about the way we got together," shared Timberlake . "It was very un-Hollywood-esque, in fact. We met and got talking. Afterwards I asked my friend if I could call her and ask her out. My friend called Jessica and Jessica said yes, and so I called her. I did it the old fashioned way by telephone." Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Harry and Meghan were set up by a mutual friend (most likely Violet von Westenholz, a childhood friend of Harry's who works in PR for Ralph Lauren). "It was definitely a set-up. It was a blind date," Markle has said of their first date. "I didn't know much about him and so the only thing I had asked her when she said she wanted to set us up was...I had one question...I said 'Is he nice?'" Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris Ellie Goulding admitted to setting the singer and DJ up. The pair dated for more than a year before splitting in 2016. "I did play matchmaker. That's true," Goulding told The Sun . "Calvin is a really great mate and he's so fantastic, and Taylor is such a cool person who I love. I thought, They're both really awesome and both really tall, they'll be brilliant together! " Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal This infamously short-lived relationship can be traced back to Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar-winner introduced Gyllenhaal and Swift at a dinner party at her London home. The speck of a relationship is rumored to have been the inspiration for two of Swift's songs: "All Too Well" and "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together." Emily Blunt and John Krasinski The actors were introduced by Blunt's Devil Wears Prada costar, Anne Hathaway. For Krasinski, it was love at first sight. "It was one of those things where I wasn't really looking for a relationship and I was thinking I'm going to take my time in L.A. Then I met her and I was so nervous. I was like, Oh god, I think I'm going to fall in love with her. As I shook her hand I went, 'I like you.'" Stanley Tucci and Felicity Blunt Tucci Emily Blunt later played Cupid herself, introducing her sister Felicity to her The Devil Wears Prada costar Stanley Tucci. Sparks flew between the pair at Blunt and Krasinski's wedding, and they tied their own knot in 2012. Salma Hayek and François-Henri Pinault The pair were set up back in 2006 and the blind date could not have started off worse. "I didn't know it was a date," the actress told Latina . "I thought I was going to an event, and then there was one person at it. I was set up by friends to think I was going to an event, because they knew I wouldn't go on a date! I was angry. And he didn't know, because he thought I knew he was coming just to meet me. I started out really badly, but, as you can see, it ended happy." Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux The details here are a little murky but the actors definitely met in 2007 somehow through the film Tropic Thunder , which Theroux co-write, either via mutual friends Robert Downey Jr. or Ben Stiller , though they didn't start dating then. Aniston and Theroux reconnected in 2010 and had a long love affair before calling it quits in early 2018 after two years of marriage. "He and Jen fell in a real, legit fashion," Downey told Details . "And he was willing from the jump to make sacrifices." Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt Everyone is desperate to set Aniston up, it seems. In 1998 , her and Pitt's agents set them up on a blind date that led to a seven-year relationship. Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady The model and quarterback met through a mutual friend who decided to play matchmaker. "This friend told me he knew a girl version of me," the NFL player told Details back in 2009 . The sparks that flew were mutual. "I knew Tom was the one straightaway. I could see it in his eyes that he was a man with integrity who believes in the same things I do," Bündchen told Vogue . FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson This couple's two-year relationship was initiated via a special introduction by Sienna Miller and her then-beau Tom Sturridge. The three actors attended an FKA Twigs concert together, and Sturridge made sure to get Pattinson backstage access to meet the singer. Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have dated off and on for years and have three children together. None of that would have happened if it weren't for Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis, who told InTouch that he's responsible for the couple meeting. "I i ntroduced Kourtney and Scott at my house in Mexico ," he said. "Scott came as the guest of a friend of mine, and they met in my master bedroom." Well then. Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman The couple were introduced by a mutual friend at the Palm Springs Film Festival in 2008. The two have been married since 2012 and have a son together, so I guess you could say things worked out nicely. Though Hathaway has said she only married Shulman because she " couldn't get Emily [Blunt]." Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid These two were set up by Grammy-winning artist Ed Sheeran of all people. "My housemate [Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid] who I've lived with for a year, I introduced him to Courteney Cox. They started dating and [are] crazy about each other," Sheeran told Yahoo . The pair got engaged in 2014. Despite splitting briefly, they are back on and it's rumored Jennifer Aniston will be maid of honor at the wedding. We love a happy ending! Benji Madden and Cameron Diaz Nicole Richie is behind this pairing. The reality star, who is married to Madden's brother, Joel, took credit for the couple during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live . "I approve of anything that's going to make Benji happy," she said. "I'm going to take responsibility for everything!" Josh Groban and Kat Dennings The couple were set up by Dennings' Two Broke Girls costar Beth Behrs, who had been friends with Groban for years. "I always wanted to find him the right girl. At the time, Kat was in a relationship, so I couldn't. Then they happened to both be single for once at the same time," Behrs told People . Timing really is everything. Unfortunately, things fell apart, and they called it quits in July 2016. Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara Vergara's Modern Family costar Jesse Tyler Ferguson introduced the couple at a party, and later gave Manganiello Vergara's phone number to help move things along. The genetically-blessed couple has been married since 2015. Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson The reality star and basketball player have a very pushy friend to thank for their relationship (and adorable daughter, True). "I was put on a blind date with Tristan and that's how [we met]," Khloé explained during the Keeping Up With the Kardashians 10th anniversary special. "Brandon Jennings, who is a basketball player and a friend of mine and Malika [Haqq]' s, was like, 'You're such a good girl, I want to introduce you to someone.' I was at the Bel-Air hotel, and [Tristan] came to the dinner. I didn't want to go on a blind date, so Brandon kind of ambushed the blind date. We just connected." Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky The beautiful Aussies met through their dialect coach, who knew they would hit it off. She was right the couple married in 2010. "It was like a blind date," Pataky explained during an appearance on El Hormiguero . "We had never seen each other before. It was our dialect coach, the person who helped us both with the accent. So, this lady started to talk to each other about each other. Finally, she insisted so much that I thought, Okay, let's meet ." Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Jack Antonoff's sister, Rachel, and comedian Mike Birbiglia set the couple up. "It was a blind date by modern standards. I mean, I used the internet," Antonoff explained to Vulture . "[On the date] I told Lena everything about my whole life, because when you really like someone, you want them to know everything about you." The pair split in early 2018 after five years together. Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber The supermodel has her agent, Michael Gruber, to thank for connecting her with her husband, Rande Gerber. When Gruber was getting married, he suggested that Crawford and Gerber be each other's dates to his big day. "We decided to meet the night before and get to know each other," Gerber told People . "I was surprised at how cool and down-to-earth she was." Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Okay, so these two didn't meet because of friends they originally met on the set of Green Lantern  but they did fall in love because of friends. Blake and Ryan were so meant to be they realized they had to be together while on a double date...with other people. "That was like the most awkward date for the respective parties because we were just like fireworks coming across [the table]," Reynolds shared with Entertainment Weekly . Sorry, not sorry. Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Sansa Stark may not have been so lucky in love, but Turner's real life love story came about when she asked Hailee Steinfield for the 411 on Jonas after the two singers collaborated on the DNCE hit "Rock Bottom." Steinfield slid Turner the digits, and well...the rest is history! Megan Trainor and Daryl Sabara Trainor credits the good taste of her friend Chloë Grace Moretz for helping her find love with actor Daryl Sabara. "[Chloë] is a friend of mine, and day one of meeting her, I was like, 'You know anybody that I could date?'" she said on Chelsea Handler's Netflix series. "And she's like, 'I know the nicest guy in the world, Daryl, and you should meet him!'" Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Hilarie Burton Morgan's close friend and Supernatural star Jensen Ackles is to thank for this pair; Ackles and his wife arranged a casual blind double date with Burton in 2009. A few tequila shots later, it was love. The couple is now married with children. Lauren Conrad and William Tell The pair actually met for the first time when Conrad was in high school; Tell was a singer and guitarist for the band Something Corporate, and LC was a fangirl attending the group's concert. Fast forward to 2014, when the couple caught a vibe on their Valentine's Day blind date. "I met my husband when I was 16 and sitting onstage at one of his concerts. Ten years later we were set up on a blind date," she wrote on her blog . Conrad and Tell are now happily married with one child (and another on the way). ••• For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter .

AAAogC5	finance	finance-saving-investing	Why Wall Street is ignoring Trump's trade war	While other stock markets globally struggle, the U.S. is soaring -- so far -- thanks to strong growth and profits	Stock prices suffered for months amid investors' worries about higher interest rates and President Donald Trump's trade war with China and others. But now another record high seems inevitable as the Dow Jones industrials index pushes back toward its January peak, passing the 26,600 threshold Thursday, and the broader S&P 500 index also above the record heights it reached last month. And although the trade issues continue to boil -- including Mr. Trump's imposition this week of fresh tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports -- investors seem just fine looking past them to bid up prices. Why? One of the most striking characteristics of the market's recent rise has been how it stands in opposition to the weakness seen in other markets. From Germany to China, stock markets in both developed and emerging economies have been struggling. It's easy to see why the U.S. has gone the other way: Fueled by last year's tax cuts and a ballooning federal deficit, U.S. GDP growth is tracking at a 4.4 percent annual rate for the current quarter following a 4.2 percent performance last quarter. Corporate profitability is strong. And consumer confidence is high. Maybe trade wars really are " easy to win " after all. Or at least so far, things are proceeding smoothly. Read more from Anthony Mirhaydari and other top money experts Thus, the SPDR World ex-US ETF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of developed market stocks outside the U.S., is still down nearly 8 percent from its January high while U.S. stocks are on the verge of new all-time highs. Money managers are on the scent. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's latest fund manager survey shows a multiyear preference for U.S. equities amid an economic and market performance that's "decoupling" from the rest of the world. Managers are allocating money to U.S. stocks within their portfolios at levels not seen since January 2015. The U.S. is now the most favored equity region globally for the second month running. When fund managers were asked about their regional expectations for corporate profits, a net 69 percent said the U.S. was tops. That's a record 17-year high. Digging in to the data, managers are keeping a specific focus within U.S. markets on the "FAANG" mega-cap technology stocks -- although that can really be narrowed down to "AA" for Apple and Amazon recently, given the underperformance of Facebook, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. The team at Merrill Lynch dub this dynamic "splendid isolation" amid buoyant U.S. markets. The chart above shows how despite rising U.S. trade policy uncertainty, global financial stress remains stable. Yet the risk remains that the trade situation spirals downward from here and eventually becomes a drag on U.S. growth and corporate profitability. That's especially a worry with the tariff rate on the latest $200 billion in Chinese imports set to grow from 10 percent now to 25 percent in January. Mr. Trump is also threatening another round of tariffs on the remaining $267 billion of Chinese imports if Beijing takes retaliatory action . And Beijing has vowed to do just that. It's unclear if the president considers China's latest response, a tariff on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods at a 5 percent to 10 percent rate, as a triggering action. Goldman Sachs doesn't expect an agreement between the U.S. and China that could reverse these actions until after the midterm elections on Nov. 6. And it expects Mr. Trump will indeed launch another round of tariffs within the next few weeks to take effect in early 2019, raising the stakes for a potential meeting between the U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting scheduled for Nov. 30. UBS strategists believe America's bull market should last awhile longer amid continuing strong economic activity and a robust labor market. But that assumes additional tariffs, rapid wage hikes and faster inflation don't materialize. Capital Economics, however, warns that the current market rally is merely a lull in the storm ahead of more aggressive U.S. trade action not only against China but others, including the European Union. Indeed, earlier this week Mr. Trump asserted that the U.S. is being "ripped off" by the Europeans as well as China. If so, trade-sensitive stocks like Caterpillar and Boeing will be vulnerable.

It combines a handsome, roomy cabin with a balanced ride, whether it's on pavement or hitting the trails. However, its poor reliability rating and meager safety score hold it back in our rankings.	The 2015 Jeep Cherokee ranks in the bottom third of the compact SUV class. It combines a handsome, roomy cabin with a balanced ride, whether it's on pavement or hitting the trails. However, its poor reliability rating and meager safety score hold it back in our rankings. The 2015 Jeep Cherokee is ranked: #13 in 2015 Affordable Compact SUVs #23 in 2015 Affordable SUVs with 2 Rows #31 in Used Compact SUVs $15K to $20K #32 in 2015 Affordable Crossover SUVs #46 in Used SUVs with 2 Rows $15K to $20K #70 in Used Crossover SUVs $15K to $20K Is the 2015 Jeep Cherokee a Good Used Car? Despite its ranking, the 2015 Cherokee is a good used compact SUV . The Cherokee touts a surprisingly refined interior for this segment, and it blends a cushioned ride with superior off-road abilities. It also has relatively low ownership costs. However, there are some downsides, including an underpowered base engine and a tiny cargo hold. This Jeep also has one of the lowest reliability ratings in the class, and its safety score, while not bad, lags behind that of some rivals. Why You Can Trust Us We've researched 24 Jeep Cherokee reviews, as well as hard data points like reliability scores and cost of ownership estimates, to help you make the best car-buying decision possible. U.S. News & World Report has been ranking cars since 2007, and our team has more than 75 years of automotive industry experience combined. While we're passionate about cars, we're even more committed to providing helpful consumer advice. To ensure our reviews remain impartial, we refuse expensive gifts and trips from car companies, and an outside team handles the advertising on our site. How Much Is the 2015 Jeep Cherokee? Our site has more than 3,400 listings for the 2015 Jeep Cherokee, with an average price of around $19,800. Prices range from about $14,800 to about $25,100, and they fluctuate depending on the vehicle's features, mileage, condition, and location. How Much Does the 2015 Jeep Cherokee Cost to Own? The 2015 Cherokee tends to be more affordable than most of its classmates when it comes to gas, insurance, repair, and maintenance costs. You can expect to pay around $22,400 over five years for these expenses, which is about what you would pay for a 2015 Ford Escape over five years. The 2015 Honda CR-V 's five-year costs are about $2,600 lower than the Cherokee's. Is It Better to Buy a Used or New Cherokee? The 2019 Jeep Cherokee benefits from a midgeneration refresh that brings a lot of changes to the model. The Cherokee has updated interior and exterior styling, as well as a newly standard 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay also make their debut in the Cherokee (as standard equipment). A newly available 2.0-liter turbocharged engine slots in the middle of the powertrain lineup, giving buyers a happy medium of power and fuel economy. The 2019 Cherokee is a better version than a used 2015 model, but you'll have to decide if it's worth the higher price. New Cherokee range in price from $24,545 to over $36,000, and you might pay anywhere from about $15,000 to about $25,000 for a 2015 Cherokee. For what you might pay for a used 2015 Cherokee, consider a new compact SUV like the 2019 Hyundai Tucson . It's a good value, with an MSRP of $23,200, and it has a long list of standard features including driver drowsiness monitoring, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, and an infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. You'll still have to pay more if you want amenities like leather upholstery, heated front seats, satellite radio, or more active safety features. However, these are options you'll probably find in higher-trim 2015 Cherokee models, which top out around $25,000. However, a new Tucson comes with the longest powertrain warranty in the industry, covering 10 years or 100,000 miles. Which Model Year of the Jeep Cherokee Is Best? The Jeep Cherokee was reintroduced to the market for the 2014 model year. For 2015, models with a V6 engine received a standard engine stop-start system, and the Cherokee's available forward collision warning system was bolstered with low-speed automatic emergency braking. The 2016 Cherokee gained Siri Eyes Free functionality, as well as a drag and drop menu bar for its available 8.4-inch infotainment system. You can likely save more money by shopping for older Cherokee models than more recent ones, but you may miss out on some features. How Reliable Is the 2015 Jeep Cherokee? The 2015 Jeep Cherokee has a poor reliability rating of two out of five from J.D. Power. 2015 Jeep Cherokee Recalls At the time of this writing, a number of open recalls apply to the 2015 Jeep Cherokee. The cruise control may malfunction and not allow cancellation. An available fire extinguisher may be clogged or inoperable. Improperly torqued seat fasteners can cause the seats to move. The transmission can unexpectedly shift to neutral. A water leak can cause a short circuit in the power tailgate's electrical module. An air conditioning hose can make contact with the exhaust manifold and increase the risk of a fire. Radio and software vulnerabilities can allow for unauthorized access, remote modification, and control of the car. Side curtain air bags can deploy unexpectedly and increase the risk of injury or risk of a crash. Be sure that a Jeep dealer has addressed these issues before buying a used 2015 Cherokee. See more information on Jeep Cherokee safety recalls » Which Used Jeep Cherokee Model Is Right for Me? The 2015 Cherokee comes in four trims: Sport, Latitude, Trailhawk, and Limited. Skip the base Sport trim and its slim standard features list and step up to the Latitude trim. It adds features like dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats, a rearview camera, and an upgraded 8.4-inch infotainment system. You can also get the Latitude with the optional V6 engine. The Cherokee Trailhawk and its range of trail-ready equipment is best for those who want to go off-roading. {"type":"[CPO-Warranty-Text]"} How Safe Is the Cherokee? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2015 Jeep Cherokee an overall safety rating of four out of five stars, with four stars in the frontal crash and rollover tests and five stars in the side crash test. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Cherokee the highest rating of Good in four crash tests, and the second-lowest rating of Marginal in the driver-side small overlap front test. Cherokee models equipped with the optional front crash prevention features earned the highest score of Superior from the IIHS. The 2015 Cherokee doesn't come standard with any driver assistance features, but some models may have a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. 2015 Jeep Cherokee Versus the Competition Which Is Better: 2015 Jeep Cherokee or 2015 Ford Escape? The 2015 Ford Escape ranks among the best compact SUVs of its model year, thanks in part to its nimble handling and above-average reliability rating. It has a peppier base engine than the Cherokee, and the Escape offers two turbocharged options. The Ford also boasts a larger cargo hold. On top of all that, it has a lower average price than the Jeep by around $2,500, and it earns a better reliability rating. Unless you need the Cherokee's off-road ability, go for the Escape. Which Is Better: 2015 Jeep Cherokee or 2015 Honda CR-V? The Honda CR-V is a much better buy than the Cherokee. When it was new, we named the CR-V our 2015 Best Compact SUV for the Money and 2015 Best Compact SUV for Families . It has excellent crash test ratings, a large cargo hold, and some of the lowest five-year ownership costs in the segment. Although the Cherokee is available with a V6 engine that's stronger than the CR-V's sole four-cylinder power plant, that's not enough for us to recommend it over the Honda. 2015 Cherokee Performance How Does the 2015 Jeep Cherokee Drive? The Cherokee performs just as well on the daily commute as it does tackling trails. The base 184-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is fine around the city, but it feels underpowered on the highway. The available 271-horsepower 3.2-liter V6 is more muscular and a better choice for everyday driving. Both engines come with a smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic transmission. The Cherokee has a comfortable ride, and though it's not particularly athletic, it is easily the most off-road-capable compact SUV available. Front-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is available. There are three different 4X4 drive systems throughout the lineup, and various off-road-oriented upgrades like skid plates, a locking rear differential, and hill descent control. Does the 2015 Jeep Cherokee Get Good Gas Mileage? With its base engine and front-wheel drive, the 2015 Cherokee gets an EPA-estimated 21 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway, which is about average for the class. A model with the base engine and four-wheel drive returns 21 mpg city and 28 mpg highway. The Cherokee with a V6 engine gets up to 21/29 mpg city/highway with FWD, and 20/27 mpg city/highway with 4WD. 2015 Jeep Cherokee Towing Capacity When properly equipped, the Cherokee can tow up to 4,500 pounds. 2015 Cherokee Interior How Many People Does the 2015 Cherokee Seat? The Cherokee's cabin seats five and has smart styling and top-quality materials that give it an upscale look and feel. The front seats are comfortable enough for long trips, and the second-row seats are roomy enough for adults, especially after you slide them to their rearmost position. Cloth upholstery and manually adjustable front seats are standard. Available amenities include leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, an eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat, a heated steering wheel, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. How Many Car Seats Fit in the 2015 Jeep Cherokee? The Cherokee has two complete sets of rear LATCH child-seat connections. The middle seat has one dedicated lower anchor, and it can borrow the lower anchor from the driver's side rear seat. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Cherokee's LATCH system the second-highest rating of Acceptable for overall ease of use. All of the tether anchors are easy to find, but on the outboard seats, there's other hardware that could be confused for the anchor. The lower anchors are easy to access in all seats. 2015 Jeep Cherokee Features Standard features include Bluetooth, two USB ports, a six-speaker stereo, voice command activation, and a 5-inch touch screen. Available features include dual-zone automatic climate control, a 115-volt household-style power outlet, a 7-inch digital instrument display, satellite radio, a 10-speaker Alpine premium stereo, an 8.4-inch touch screen, HD Radio, navigation, wireless device charging, proximity key entry, push-button start, and remote start. Both of the touch-screen interfaces are easy to use and respond quickly to inputs. There are also physical controls for some frequently used features. 2015 Jeep Cherokee Dimensions Jeep Cherokee Cargo Space The 2015 Jeep Cherokee has 24.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind its back seat, and it offers 54.9 cubic feet of space with the second row folded. 2015 Cherokee Length and Weight The 2015 Cherokee is 15.2 feet long. Its curb weight ranges from 3,655 pounds to 4,108 pounds. Where Was the 2015 Jeep Cherokee Built? Jeep built the 2015 Cherokee in Ohio. Read the full 2015 Jeep Cherokee review on U.S. News & World Report for more details, photos, specs and prices.

Brownies from scratch. What a glorious concept. We'll get around to it when we finally join that CSA, learn how to knit and clean under the fridge. Until then, here's a two-second trick to make brownies from a box taste like the real thing. What you need: Brownie mix, eggs, vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. What you do: Make the brownie batter according to the package directions, then stir in the cinnamon and chili powder before pouring into the pan and baking as usual. Why it works: The spices add a peppery sweetness that blends perfectly with the chocolate and creates a whole new depth of flavor. Your brownie taste testers won't be able to put their finger on the exact ingredients, but there's one thing they'll know for sure it tastes fancy (and decidedly not from a box).

Chipotle will be saying thanks to teachers across the country by offering a buy-one-get-one-free deal on burritos and more. Chipotle is joining the monkey pile of gratitude for teachers. Teacher Appreciation Week runs May 6-10 and Teacher Appreciation Day, for everyone who can't spend a whole week being thankful, lands on Tuesday, May 7. To show its gratitude to all the people who help shape our formative years, Chipotle is serving up a buy-one-get-one-free (BOGO) deal on burritos, burrito bowls, salads, and taco orders for teachers on May 7. Every Chipotle in the United States will be participating in the BOGO deal from 3pm until close, so it'll have to be a late lunch or after school. To get the offer, you need to present a valid ID proving you're an educator. However, the chain's definition of an educator is quite broad, so lots of people can join the burrito party. It's valid for "educators and staff at all levels, including pre-school, elementary, middle and high school, university, and homeschooling parents." So, if you work at a school, you should be good to go. Though, you do have to order at a restaurant. The offer isn't valid for online, mobile, or catering orders. The burrito purveyor is just one of many popular restaurant chains all across the country handing out all sorts of free food and other food deals for teachers . If you're a haberdasher or other kind of person and feel left out, it's OK. At least you don't have to teach anyone math.

BBLpup5	autos	autosreview	2017 Lincoln Continental: What You Need to Know	The 2017 Lincoln Continental is a high-ranking luxury large car that boasts great safety and predicted reliability ratings. Although it has a roomy, elegant cabin and plenty of power, its numb steering holds it back.	The 2017 Lincoln Continental is a high-ranking luxury large car that boasts great safety and predicted reliability ratings. Although it has a roomy, elegant cabin and plenty of power, its numb steering holds it back. Is the 2017 Lincoln Continental a Good Used Car? The 2017 Continental is a good used luxury large car . Its three available engines have ample power, and its forgiving suspension smooths out bumps in the road nicely. This luxury sedan offers a ton of first-class amenities, some of the most comfortable seats on the market, and more than enough back-seat space. Still, the Continental's handling and fuel economy aren't that impressive. Why You Can Trust Us We've researched 20 Lincoln Continental reviews, as well as hard data points like reliability scores and cost of ownership estimates, to help you make the best car-buying decision possible. U.S. News & World Report has been ranking cars since 2007, and our team has more than 75 years of automotive industry experience combined. While we're passionate about cars, we're even more committed to providing helpful consumer advice. To ensure our reviews remain impartial, we refuse expensive gifts and trips from car companies, and an outside team handles the advertising on our site. How Much Is the 2017 Lincoln Continental? Used prices for the 2017 Continental sedan range from about $34,000 to about $57,500, with the average price landing just over $45,000. This data comes from more than 400 used listings for the 2017 Continental on our site. Actual prices fluctuate depending on the vehicle's features, mileage, condition, and location. How Much Does the 2017 Lincoln Continental Cost to Own? The 2017 Continental tends to be more expensive than its competitors when it comes to gas, insurance, repair, and maintenance costs. You can expect to pay around $30,000 over five years for these expenses. In comparison, the 2017 Cadillac CT6 has lower five-year costs by about $1,900, and the 2017 Lincoln MKZ 's costs are lower by roughly $5,900. Is It Better to Buy a Used or New Continental? Lincoln made no major changes to the Continental for 2018. You can likely save thousands of dollars and get a nearly identical car by shopping for a used 2017 Continental instead of a new 2018 Continental . Since the average price of a used 2017 model is close to the base price of a new model, you'll likely get more for your money as well. For less than what you might pay for a 2017 Continental, you could consider a new nonluxury large sedan like the highly ranked 2019 Toyota Avalon . It's fully redesigned for 2019 and has a luxurious interior with plenty of space and most of the features found in the 2017 Continental offers. An Avalon Limited with the Advanced Safety package comes in at under $43,000. An Avalon with that configuration features five USB ports, a Wi-Fi hot spot, Apple CarPlay, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a head-up display, a 14-speaker JBL audio system, a surround-view camera, and rear automatic braking. All Avalon models come with advanced safety features like blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking. Which Model Year of the Lincoln Continental Is Best? After a 15-year hiatus, Lincoln reintroduced the Continental as an all-new car for the 2017 model year. As such, there are no similar used models available from previous years. How Reliable Is the 2017 Lincoln Continental? The 2017 Lincoln Continental has an above-average predicted reliability rating of four out of five from J.D. Power. 2017 Lincoln Continental Recalls At the time of this writing, there are two open recalls that apply to the 2017 Continental. One corrects a problem with a front airbag not deploying properly in a crash. Another recall involves incorrect headlight lenses that may reduce turn signal visibility to other drivers and pedestrians. Make sure these issues are taken care of by a Lincoln dealer before purchasing a used 2017 Continental. See more information on Lincoln Continental safety recalls » Which Used Lincoln Continental Model Is Right for Me? The 2017 Continental is available in four trim levels: Premier, Select, Reserve, and Black Label. A base Premier model comes with a ton of features and a relatively powerful engine for everyday driving, but it's probably worth looking for a Reserve model. This trim adds 24-way power-adjustable and ventilated front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, navigation, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. Its 335-horsepower twin-turbocharged engine also gets the best fuel economy in the Continental's engine lineup. Certified Pre-Owned Lincoln Continental Warranty Though it usually costs a bit more, a certified pre-owned Continental may suit you better. However, nearly all other luxury brands provide better coverage and benefits with their CPO programs than Lincoln does. For its certified pre-owned vehicles, Lincoln extends its original new-car warranty to six years or 100,000 miles. Lincoln puts its CPO vehicles through a 200-point inspection. Additional benefits like towing and roadside assistance may be available, so read the Lincoln warranty page carefully. How Safe Is the Continental? The 2017 Lincoln Continental has great safety scores. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Continental a five-star overall rating, with five out of five stars in the frontal and side crash tests. It received four stars in the rollover test. The Continental also earned top scores in all crash tests performed at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The IIHS named the Continental a 2017 Top Safety Pick+, the organization's highest award. A rearview camera comes standard, along with front and rear parking sensors. MyKey is a standard feature in the Continental that allows you to set volume and speed limits for other drivers. Available driver assistance features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, lane-keep assist, a surround-view camera, parallel park assist, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking./ 2017 Lincoln Continental Versus the Competition Which Is Better: 2017 Lincoln Continental or 2017 Cadillac CT6? The 2017 Cadillac CT6 has great overall performance for a luxury large car . Both the Continental and the CT6 offer a lineup of three powerful engines, but the Caddy is undeniably sportier. It drives like a smaller car thanks to sharp handling and strong brakes. It also has a comfortable ride, supple seats, and a quiet cabin. On the other hand, the Continental has a soft suspension that helps it better absorb bumps in the road. Both of these large sedans offer all the technology and comfort amenities you would expect in a luxury vehicle, as well as a cavernous second row. You'll get a bigger trunk with the Lincoln, though. The Continental comes out ahead in our rankings because of its higher predicted reliability rating, but the CT6 is the better option if engaging performance is a high priority. Which Is Better: 2017 Lincoln Continental or 2017 Lincoln MKZ? The 2017 Lincoln MKZ is a luxury midsize car that can't match the high standards of its flagship sedan sibling. However, the MKZ is worth considering if you must have the Lincoln badge but you're on a tighter budget. Its average list price is about $15,000 lower than the Continental's, and the smaller Lincoln will also save you almost $6,000 in five-year expenses. The MKZ's second row has adequate space for adult passengers, though it can't quite match the Continental generous dimensions. These two cars have a comparable list of standard and available features, but the Continental offers more in the way of seating upgrades. The MKZ has ponderous handling, and it has slightly lower safety and predicted reliability ratings than the Continental. If you have the extra room in your budget, the larger Lincoln is a hands-down better choice here. 2017 Continental Performance How Does the 2017 Lincoln Continental Drive? The 2017 Lincoln Continental comes standard with a 305-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 engine. There are also two twin-turbocharged V6 engines available. The midrange 335-horsepower 2.7-liter V6 has ample muscle for any driving situation. The most formidable powertrain is a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 that puts out 400 horsepower, giving you outstanding acceleration. You might find some hiccups with the Continental's six-speed automatic transmission. It's not the most responsive, and it sometimes changes gears erratically. Unfortunately, it's the only transmission available. The Continental is a luxury cruiser above all else, with a suspension that prioritizes a comfortable ride over sporty handling. You can even tailor that ride more to your liking, as the Continental has selectable driving modes that affect suspension firmness. It has capable handling and remains planted, exhibiting little body lean around corners. The steering may not feel that sharp or responsive, but some reviewers note that it's balanced. Continentals with either of the two less powerful engines are available with either rear- or all-wheel drive; models with the most powerful engine come with AWD. Does the 2017 Lincoln Continental Get Good Gas Mileage? The 2017 Continental gets its best gas mileage with the midrange 2.7-liter V6 engine: 18 mpg in the city and 27 mpg on the highway. The standard engine is a little less efficient at 17/26 mpg city/highway. Fuel economy goes as low as 16/24 mpg city/highway with the 3.0-liter engine. Most rivals get better mileage estimates than the Continental. Even within the Lincoln lineup, the 2017 MKZ gets up to 21/31 mpg city/highway. 2017 Continental Interior How Many People Does the 2017 Continental Seat? The Lincoln Continental has plenty of room for up to five passengers. The front seats are spacious and comfortable even in the base model, and you'll have an excellent view of the road from the driver's seat. Heated front seats are standard. There are several upgrades that add to the front seats' allure, including premium leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, massaging seats, and up to 30-way power seat adjustability. The rear seats offer VIP-level comfort as well. They give passengers plenty of legroom and several luxury upgrades. To provide the most accommodating ride for back-seat passengers, look for models with the Rear-Seat package. It includes heated and ventilated seats, reclining and four-way power-adjustable seats, rear-window sunshades, and a center armrest with an LCD screen and climate controls. The only drawback to this luxury sedan's stately second row is that taller passengers may wish for more headroom. How Many Car Seats Fit in the 2017 Lincoln Continental? The Lincoln Continental has two complete sets of LATCH car-seat connectors. The rear middle seat features a top tether anchor, and it can borrow a lower anchor from either side. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the system the second-highest rating of Acceptable for its ease of use. The IIHS notes that the lower anchors are deep in the seat, but it's easy to maneuver your hands around the anchors once you find them. 2017 Lincoln Continental Features Standard features in the 2017 Continental include push-button start, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10-speaker audio system, satellite radio, two USB ports, and a rearview camera. The standard SYNC 3 infotainment system features an 8-inch touch screen, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay. Available features include a moonroof, tri-zone automatic climate control, a heated steering wheel, a power rear sunshade, a 110-volt household-style power outlet, two rear USB ports, navigation, HD Radio, and a 13- or 19-speaker Revel premium audio system. The SYNC 3 interface quickly responds to pinch and swipe gestures just like a smartphone. The system also has voice recognition, so you can perform some functions just by speaking.

From taking the bus to walking on sidewalks, transportation is changing in the growing city of Norfolk. To add to the list of options, a new electric bike business opened its doors on April 26th. Pedego Norfolk has electric bikes anyone can rent and return for the day, or buy on sale. They're located in the heart of downtown, off East City Hall Avenue. "It's an incredible opportunity," said owner Amy Oliver. She said it's the first electric bike store in Norfolk, and she chose to bring the business here because of the city's layout. "Their biking infrastructure is phenomenal," said Oliver. "There are trails, bike paths, and shared paths on the road." Old Dominion University's professor of Economics, Bob Mcnab said this new business shows how Norfolk city officials pay attention to what attracts people to the city, and it's the quality of life. "The more attractive you are to alternative forms of transportation the more likely you are, to what, to attract investment and attract entrepreneurship," said Mcnab. With more people choosing alternative modes of transportation, Oliver hopes people come to enjoy these electric bikes as an eco-friendly alternative to driving. "It takes about ten cents worth of electricity to charge it up," said Oliver. For only $25 an hour, Oliver said it's perfect for locals and tourists. Pedego Norfolk will have an official ribbon cutting for its new business on May 31st. For more information on Pedego, click here .

BBOthIn	foodanddrink	recipes	How to Toast Nuts In the Oven	Because you should really be doing it yourself	Allow me tell you about the importance of toasting nuts yourself. Now, I know you can probably walk to the nearest drugstore and buy yourself a package of roasted almonds or pistachios whenever you darn well please. However, if you did a side-by-side taste test, freshly toasted nuts and seeds are just plain better: they're crunchier, deeper in flavor, and just, well, toastier. Here's how to do it. This method applies to any nuts or seeds almonds, walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews, pistachios, pepitas, sunflower seeds though final cooking time will vary based on the size of the nut and temperature of your individual oven. Preheat your oven (or toaster oven) to 325ºF. Pour 1 cup of whichever nuts or seeds you want to toast onto an unlined, rimmed sheet pan but not a combination of several kinds; again, they won't all toast at the same speed. Drizzle the nuts with 1 tablespoon oil (I often use olive oil, but grapeseed or avocado oil will also do the trick). If you'd like, add a couple pinches of kosher salt. Even if you end up using the nuts in sweeter applications, like to top a bowl of oatmeal or in cookies, a little salt will only help amplify the flavor of whatever else you're eating. Toss the nuts with the oil and salt if using, and slide the sheet pan into the oven. After 5 minutes, toss the nuts around a bit to ensure even browning. Continue toasting the nuts for 5 minute intervals until they've browned a bit and smell toasty. Ultimately, smell will likely tell you when they're done, but it should take between 10 and 20 minutes to fully toast the nuts. Once you've toasted the nuts and let them cool, the possibilities are endless. Grind them into the most roasty-tasting DIY nut or butter. Give them a rough chop and use as a topping for oatmeal, salads, smoothies, or yogurt. Stir them into a batch of DIY granola (after it's baked) or muesli. If you're not going to use the nuts right away, transfer them to a mason jar with a lid and store in the refrigerator to keep them fresh and crunchy.

See which zodiac signs make our top 5 lists and the reasons why you sometimes they make us want to run for the hills. 1. Virgo With their practical and analytic approach to everything they do, Virgos are undoubtedly the most difficult sign to get on with.

Their overly critical nature and reluctance to express their feelings can make them very hard to get along with. 2. Aquarius While they may be good listeners, don't expect too much back from an Aquarius . Their tendency to run from any emotional expression can be extremely frustrating, especially if you've just opened up with them. They still expect you to intuitively understand their needs, even though they haven't told you anything, and don't be shocked if they just up and leave   Aquarius have a deep need to get away and be alone from time to time, especially if they get bored of you. 3. Aries Even though an Aries might be the most fun on a night out , they're also one of the most difficult zodiacs to get along with for the same reason. You may not notice it when drunk, but their natural impulsivity can sometimes transform itself into obnoxiousness . They often say things without considering contex t and act without thinking through the implications. Also, their eagerness to act can lead to many promises, but a lack of follow-through means they're rarely fulfilled. 4. Leo Although it seems like everyone loves them, Leos can be some of the most difficult people to get along with. Leos need constant attention and hate feeling undervalued , even if they don't directly say it. Being of the proudest zodiacs means that they expect to be treated like a king or queen, without having to remind people of it. Even worse, if you made a bad first impression on them, don't expect them to change their mind   their opinion of you won't change. 5. Gemini In spite of their sociability, Geminis can be a nightmare to deal with after a while. Their ability to adapt to new people and situations helps them make friends, but their inconsistency in maintaining the same personality makes them difficult people to hang out with for a prolonged period. In addition to this, their enthusiasm to make new friends and discover the world means that they tend to neglect those close to them .

He officially became a candidate on April 14, 2019. At the end of January 2019, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said he was considering a run for president as an independent.

"Today is a moment of truth... the truth is the path has narrowed to a close, for our candidacy, if not for our cause. So we must recognize that at this point in the race the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together," he said. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., ended her Democratic presidential campaign on March 2, 2020 and endorsed rival Joe Biden in an effort to unify moderate voters behind the former vice president's White House bid.

Apart from that, she also cited the novel coronavirus disease as a reason for her ending the campaign.

The GLA is the company's smallest crossover, blending car-like handling with a bit of SUV utility. This March, you can lease a front-wheel-drive GLA for $319 per month and $3,713 at signing. You can upgrade to a 4Matic all-wheel-drive GLA with payments of $339 per month and $3,883 upfront. The deals expire on March 31 and have a cap of 30,000 miles. Though the GLA isn't exactly quick, it does offer sporty handling and admirable fuel economy for a non-hybrid. There's seating for five, though rear-seat passengers have limited space. Its fastback shape is stylish but limits cargo space. The 2020 GLA does not have a score in our ranking of luxury subcompact SUVs , as independent crash test organizations have not thoroughly evaluated it. 2020 Mazda CX-30 Lease Deal: As low as $205 per month for 36 months with $2,999 due at signing One of the freshest entries in the burgeoning subcompact SUV segment is the all-new 2020 Mazda CX-30 . Slotted in the Mazda lineup between the CX-3 and CX-5 , the CX-30 has the dynamic handling common to Mazdas, but an engine that could use a bit more juice. This March, you can lease a CX-30 with payments ranging from $205 to $215, depending on where you live, and $2,999 due at signing. The deal applies to the base CX-30 with front-wheel drive and has a cap of 36,000 miles. The CX-30 deal expires on March 31, and your location and credit score will affect your eligibility for this offer. Every CX-30 comes standard with a long list of advanced driver assistance and safety features. They include lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, driver attention monitoring, and low-speed automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. An 8.8-inch infotainment system comes standard, but support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only comes on upper trim models. As the CX-30 does not yet have complete independent crash-test assessments, it is not included in our ranking of subcompact SUVs .

The Evoque S comes standard with a 10-inch touch-screen infotainment system that includes navigation and supports an onboard Wi-Fi hot spot, Android Auto , and Apple CarPlay . Leather upholstery comes standard in the Evoque s opulent cabin. Since independent crash testing of the Evoque is not complete, the SUV is not yet scored in our ranking system.

Now, every model comes with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, a rear-seat reminder, Chevy's Teen Driver System, and more. This March, you can lease an Equinox with payments between $219 and $239 and between about $3,000 and $3,700 due at signing, depending on your location.

The Equinox comes standard with a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system that supports a Wi-Fi hot spot, a 4G LTE data connection, Android Auto , and Apple CarPlay .

AABRuxD	lifestyle	lifestylehomeandgarden	Gorgeous Summer Paint Colors Designers Say Are Best for a Home Refresh This Year	Bring on the cheer!	Bring on the cheer! Considering that summer is right around the corner, it's time to start thinking about your home refresh. Of course, you might have tasty recipes and warm-weather outfits on your mind, but it's worth carving out time to give your home an easy makeover. See this list of 10+ cheerful paint colors that are perfect for the summer season. From inspiring shades for home offices to calming hues for living rooms , these designer-approved summer colors are worth a try if you're ready to get in the mood for the upcoming season. 1) Vibrant Green "Nothing denotes the vibrancy of summer like a fresh vibrant shade of green. The deep saturation of this lush emerald green harkens to the outdoors in any environment: Lush fields, tropical trees, flowering forests. The key to evoking the energy and vitality of summer is to be brave and choose a bold hue."   Emilie Munroe, Studio Munroe 2) Peachy-Pink "We are loving First Light by Benjamin Moore a little bit pink, a little bit peach for its youthful, happy feel. Use it in a teen room, a powder room, or really anywhere you want to create a fun space."   Kristen Peña, K Interiors 3) Bright Red "Bright red is one of my favorite colors to use this summer. A bright splash of red, even in the smallest form, can make a big statement. It is an energetic, fun and stylish color that will add a lot of impact to any space."   Alexander Doherty , Alexander Doherty Design 4) Soft Blue "Nothing makes a space feel more relaxing than a soft blue. It creates a sense of calm and gives the room a serene feel that works great with that summer sunlight streaming in. We especially love to use this color in bedrooms because of its way of changing with the light. We especially love this tone, New Hope Gray by Benjamin Moore in a matte finish. "   Shelly Lynch-Sparks, Hyphen & Co. 5) Saturated Blue "I LOVE a bright saturated blue in the summer, it has such a wonderfully cool vibe. To make the blue in this entry hall even more vibrant, I chose a semi-gloss finish which really allows the light to play off of it. This blue reminds me of the beach umbrellas in Cannes."   Amy Sklar, Amy Sklar Design 6) Neutrals "Benjamin Moore's Sag Harbor Gray has become a new staple in our color library for summer. We used it recently for all the trim, doors, and cabinetry in my home in Connecticut. I love that it's a historical color but becomes modern when combined with crisp white walls and dark floors. The color also transforms with different lighting. It can appear khaki, gray, and even green in the right light."   Kevin Dumais, Dumais 7) Melon "I love this cantaloupe color, Persian Melon by Benjamin Moore, because it reminds me of a melon everyone enjoys so much in the summer it always looks fresh!"   Jan Showers, Jan Showers & Associates 8) Pewter "One of my go-to paint colors is Revere Pewter by Benjamin Moore. It looks great in just about any space and has the perfect amount of warmth in it, which keeps it from being too harsh. It looks especially good in rooms featuring rich blue and green hues, which I associate with summertime since they evoke the outdoors."   Paloma Contreras, Paloma Contreras Interior Design 9) Blue-Greens "Blue-green hues like Views remind me of the clear, calm Caribbean Sea and would look absolutely stunning in any space from a spa-like bathroom to a serene bedroom to a colorful living room or even an entryway. If you want to go outside of the box, try painting your ceiling in a clean light blue like Headspace to bring that feeling of airy, open skies into your home."   Nicole Gibbons, Clare 10) Off-White "Benjamin Moore's Timid White is the perfect just off enough white to be refreshing yet warm. I love to brush it on all surfaces of the room (walls, ceiling, moldings and casings) so it envelopes the whole space."   Melissa Warner Rothblum, Massucco Warner 11) Colors of Sunshine "Combining the warmth of orange hues with shades of pinks and yellows brings the color of sunshine indoors and is ideal for long summer days."   Marika Meyer, Marika Meyer Interiors 12) Blush "Sign me up for any shade of blush. It's so soft and gentle but always adds warmth to any space. I used a super pale blush for my daughter's bedroom ceiling and I've found that incorporating it in unexpected spots is such an easy way to add an understated glow. Try blush on the ceiling, or painting an entire powder room (walls and ceiling) for maximum effect. It's also the summer vibe I'm craving in the midst of our chaotic world."   Liz Caan, Liz Caan & Co. 13) Classic Blue "Warmer temps and summer sun inspire bolder colors! Sherwin Williams Naval Blue is the perfect summertime hue because it's a classic blue kicked up a notch. I love using it as an accent color in a butler's pantry or island base."   Marie Flanigan, Marie Flanigan Interiors 14) Gray "One of my favorite paint colors for summer is Nickel by Benjamin Moore. Nickel is a sleek and versatile light gray with blue hues that can work on many different applications such as a wall color, cabinet color, or even an accent color. The lightness of the color produces a calming and tranquil aesthetic while the blue hues stimulate the mind, increase productivity, and help you stay focused. This color would be perfect for a home office space, wouldn't you agree?"   Nina Magon, Contour Interior Design

BBLrAmc	health	medical	Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here's what's happening.	Beyond pins and needles   why falling asleep on an arm can make it feel "dead."	Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening. At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of "pins and needles" sensations. When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I'd done something horrible to my body, anxious that I'd never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back. This phenomenon is really common, says James Dyck , a neurology researcher with the Mayo Clinic. And it's actually a cool example of how the body can protect itself even during the paralysis of sleep. Dyck explained there's a common misconception that pins and needles and numbness are caused by a lack of blood flow to the nerves. "The more likely thing is nerve compression   nerves are being pushed on and squashed, and that causes these symptoms," he says. You have several nerves in your arm. Each serves a vital function. The axillary nerve lifts the arm at the shoulder. The musculocutaneous nerve bends the elbow. The radial nerve straightens out the arm and lifts your wrist and fingers. The ulnar nerve spreads your fingers. Although Dyck says the exact physiology isn't completely understood, the effect of compressing any of these nerves in sleep   when you sleep on top of your arm or pin it underneath a partner   is like stepping on a garden hose. The information that flows from your extremities back to your brain is temporarily disrupted. So why does it feel paralyzed upon waking? Dyck suggests two reasons. 1 ) It is actually, temporarily, paralyzed. During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a body-wide paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis , and it can be a frightening situation. You're stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can't move. 2 ) The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM). Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a pins-and-needles feeling. "The nerve structures, as they recover, tend to be irritable for a period of time," the University of Rochester Medical Center explains . "That's because the nerves are firing spontaneously. Most of the time, the feeling of pins and needles is a good sign. It is a temporary phase that means nerves are coming back to life." Someone who falls asleep on a limb is unlikely to do major damage to the nerves, Dyck says. But there are some cases when compressed nerves can become a greater problem. One such case is called " Saturday n ight p alsy ," when a person falls asleep compressing a nerve while drunk. The alcohol impairs your body's ability to wake you up and protect your nerves. "If you're passed out drunk, you won't move your arm," Dyck says. And when you wake up the next day, you can't extend your wrist and you can't extend your fingers." That might last longer than a few moments (perhaps even a few days or months) as the nerve has to repair its protective coating. And then there's hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to nerve compression injuries. They might want to be extra careful not to fall asleep on a limb or even cross their leg to avoid nerve compression. (Carpal tunnel may also cause tingling or numbness in limbs at night. ) Again, for most people who wake up to a dead limb, it's just a temporary annoyance. And it "probably takes less time [to recover] than you think it does, because you're freaking out about it," Dyck says.

From crawling ants to scary spiders, bugs are not something you want to find in your house. Fruit flies especially are incredibly annoying and seem to pop up out of nowhere. Sure, you can shoo them away, but a better long-term solution is learning how to get rid of fruit flies for good. Fruit flies are attracted to fermenting fruits and vegetables in your home. By rolling up your sleeves and doing a little kitchen cleaning and stocking up on some pantry staples, you'll be footloose and fruit fly-free in no time. The first thing you should do if you spot little black bugs flying around your home? Make sure you've encountered a fruit fly and not a common lookalike, such as the fungus gnat. Gnats tend to be gray or black, while fruit flies range from light tan to reddish orange and brown. Fruit flies have a taste for too-ripe fruit and other produce and thrive on high-fructose substances. Fungus gnats, on the other hand, live in soils and on plants, so if you think you're spotting those, the issue may not be in your fruit bowl. But rest assured, we can can also help you with tips galore regarding how to get rid of gnats , how to get rid of silverfish , and how to prevent mosquito bites , too. If you do believe you've got a fruit fly (or a whole family of them!) on your hands, you're going to want to take action. You're also going to want to do it in a way that's actually effective (after all, as much as we've come to appreciate them, even the best indoor mosquito traps are no good at catching these tiny flies!). Below, we're sharing how to get rid of fruit flies, from all-natural remedies to chemicals that you can spray on those little suckers, for good. For starters, where do these bugs come from and what causes fruit flies? Fruit flies hate clean surfaces, so keep those countertops as clean as possible. When you spill some fruit juice or other sugary substance, don't wait until your favorite TV show is over to clean it up. Keep those sink drains free of food particles and eradicate all the gross residue in and around the drain. If you don't, those spots become the perfect destination for fruit flies to breed. You do not want that. Females lay their eggs on the surface or inside fruit that's overripe, rotting, or decaying. Each female fly can lay up to 500 eggs at a time, so it's important to take action as soon as you spot the first fruit fly. After hatching, the larva feast on their surroundings (like a past-ripe banana) for a few days, before evolving into fully formed adults. Overall, their life cycle is pretty quick fruit flies are capable of mating just two days after they reach the adult stage which means your cleanup clock starts ASAP. How do you get rid of fruit flies? You've cleaned and cleaned, but you're still seeing fruit flies. What do you do? Break out these pantry items for a few different ways to send pests packing. Use apple cider vinegar. Fill a bowl or glass with apple cider vinegar, cover with plastic wrap and a rubber band to seal the edges, and poke tiny holes in the top. The fruit flies will be attracted to the vinegar, but once they're inside, they won't be able to escape the plastic wrap barrier. Mix apple cider vinegar and dish soap. Fill a bowl with the vinegar and add a drop of dish soap, mixing well. The apple cider vinegar tempts the flies with its stale sweetness, and the dish soap actually works to decrease the surface tension of the liquid, so the flies are immediately immersed upon investigating and can't escape. Bust out an old beer. Leave a bottle of old wine or beer out near where the fruit flies were spotted. They'll be lured in by the stale beverage, but the narrow neck of the bottle acts as a natural barrier to keep them trapped. I want to try a chemical remedy. What spray will kill fruit flies? Try one of these top-rated products to kick fruit flies out of your kitchen once and for all.

AABW7Z7	health	fitness	Wondering How Long It'll Take to See Results From Working Out? We Asked 3 Experts	You've been doing a great job of working out regularly, but how soon will you see the results of your efforts? Three experts weigh in.	Working out is great for our physical health - strength training and cardio, for example, can help improve your metabolic rate - as well as our mental health . HIIT is effective for burning fat , and if you're focused on booty gains, sprints and inclines on the treadmill are your best friends. But how soon after you start working out will you start to see results? We want to preface this by saying that everyone's fitness or weight-loss journey is different, and everyone's body is different. So no two people's results will be the same. That being said, we spoke to three experts on what to expect results-wise from exercise depending on your goals - because everyone's goals are inevitably different, too - and we broke it down for you right here. How Soon Can You Lose Weight After Exercising? NASM-certified personal trainer Guychard Codio, cofounder of New York City Personal Training , told POPSUGAR that first, you can't work out and eat in a caloric surplus and expect to lose weight; you have to burn more calories than you take in (learn more about eating in a caloric deficit here ). Healthy eating habits , he said, have to be an integral part of your workout routine. In terms of losing weight through exercise, he said people can start seeing results in two to three weeks. But, he said, if you want to kept the weight off, you'll need a routine that progresses slowly and steadily instead of one where you're going all out. For example, trying to lose 20 pounds in a month isn't a realistic goal, he said, which is what he sees some people do before weddings and some professional athletes like boxers or bodybuilders do before competitions. If you have more intense parts of your workout and diet plan where you cut calories from 2,500 to 1,200 for two months but want to maintain your weight-loss process, you should gradually bring those calories back up and increase your exercise routine as you do that, he explained. Slow and steady wins the race. (Just check out some of our POPSUGAR weight-loss success stories and you'll see proof.) Video: Why this won't help you lose weight (Provided by Buzz60) Ashley Kelly, NASM-certified personal trainer for Bach , told POPSUGAR she puts her clients through a six-week program if their goal is to lose weight through exercise, with three weeks of introductory training to get them used to an elevated heart rate, one lighter week, and two higher-intensity strength-training weeks. She'll usually do a body fat test before and after the program to see their progress. Ashleigh Kast, NASM-certified trainer at Performix House and Ladder coach , gave POPSUGAR a scenario in which people focus on exercise alone to lose weight (and by losing weight, she means losing fat). "If you're trying to lose fat by working out, you're going to need to establish a caloric deficit through working out alone," she explained, but she stressed that "the amount of working out you need to do in a week without addressing food to maintain that caloric deficit can be very stressful." Eating in a caloric deficit and exercising is what's recommended for weight loss because you'd have to burn 500 calories per day in your workouts for seven days just to lose a pound a week , which isn't a superrealistic goal. Plus, it's not recommended that you work out every day . And "in some cases, where calories are still very high, it's simply not enough to create the necessary deficit," Kast said. All the trainers we spoke to said they ultimately couldn't give a definitive answer for weight-loss results since it depends on a person's individual goals, body type, weight, age, and other factors. In general, though, they all agreed that, for healthy weight loss, it will take at least a few weeks to really see results and that an aggressive approach in a short amount of time isn't something you can sustain. You can healthily lose half a pound to two pounds a week , Jim White, owner of Jim White Fitness and Nutrition Studios and ACSM-certified personal trainer, told POPSUGAR in a previous interview. So after five weeks, you may see a loss of up to 10 pounds. How Soon Can You Gain Muscle After Exercising? Kast said that, when completing a bodybuilding or strength-training cycle of 10 to 12 weeks with at least three lifting days per week, it's not uncommon to see a muscle gain of five to seven pounds. Codio said it's going to be easier for someone who already has some muscle to add to that muscle. For this person, it normally takes about two weeks for them to see results. For someone who hasn't worked out before, it may take up to two months - and this also, he noted, varies depending on how much muscle you're trying to put on. Similarly to what she said about seeing weight-loss results in six weeks - which she named as a general timeline for her clients - Kelly said, in her opinion, you can start to see muscle changes in six weeks. This is a bit easier to do than lose weight since most people can just focus on heavy lifting, she explained. Eating in a caloric deficit isn't important; you actually need to be eating enough carbs and protein to help repair muscles. Kast further noted that people who weight train and don't address nutrition will have a harder time achieving and sustaining results. (If you're interested in the proper macros you may need to gain muscle, check out our guide on that .) Bottom Line: Gaining Muscle Helps You Lose Weight The more muscle you have, the easier it is for your body to lose fat and burn calories throughout the day , Codio said. In terms of losing fat, muscle will help with that , so if your goal is to lose weight by working out, gaining muscle to some capacity is part of the process. Kelly tells her clients to focus on the way their bodies look - definition in their arms and legs, for example - and feel progress-wise as opposed to the number on the scale. "If you try to go on the scale while you're developing muscle mass, you might see either no change in the weight, or you might see that your pounds go up. So, see how you feel in your clothes and see how you feel in the mirror," she advised. Whether your goal is to lose weight or gain muscle through exercise, Kast said it's most realistic for people to work out three to four times per week ( don't forget about rest days! ) with strength training and high-intensity cardio and an emphasis on nutrition, especially monitoring and managing calories to find out what works for you. You also have to manage stress and get plenty of sleep . As with making a change in any aspect of your life, Kelly noted, "if you're consistently doing something and wait at least 21 to 42 days, then you will see changes."

AAB9dcY	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	12 Microwave Hacks That Will Change Your Cooking Game	It can make prep and cleanup so much easier.	I never realized just how much I relied on my microwave until I didn't have one. When I moved into my first adult apartment and discovered it wasn't equipped with one, I was panicked. Suddenly, tasks that had been so simple became annoyingly complicated: I had to dirty a whole pot if I wanted to melt butter, fill up a kettle to boil water, or actually wait for my ice cream to soften (the horror!). Having to do all these extra steps made it harder to focus on the things that actually needed my attention, and my food suffered as a result. After months of trying to make it work, I couldn't take it anymore. I finally invested in my own microwave, and I've appreciated it so much more ever since. Recently, I've even noticed that chefs sing the praises of microwaves, because the appliance is really that useful. "[Microwaves are] convenient for multitasking, especially if you already have a few items cooking on the stove or are simply busy with other tasks so that if you get tied up, you don't have to worry about burning anything," Kathy Fang, two-time Chopped champion and owner of Fang in San Francisco, tells SELF. "It's also a much faster method of cooking, ideal for beginners as it cuts down cooking time and prepping steps." Here, Fang and other food experts explain all their favorite things to do with a microwave that minimize prep, cooking, and cleanup time plus, some quick and easy dishes you can make with the handy appliance. 1. Dry herbs. Because microwaves work by targeting and heating up water, Abbey Sharp, R.D., blogger and author of the Mindful Glow Cookbook , says that they can also be a great tool for drying herbs. However, she says it's better to stick with heartier herbs like rosemary or thyme, because more delicate herbs like mint or basil can't stand up to the strength of a microwave. To do it yourself, put the herbs between two paper towels and microwave them on high for 2 to 3 minutes. 2. Peel garlic faster. Sick of having dry and smelly garlic hands from all the peeling you've been doing? Let your microwave do the work instead. "Simply put a whole head of garlic into the microwave for about 15-20 seconds on high and the cloves easily come out of their skin," Sharp says. 3. Steam fish. According to Fang, her grandfather would often steam fish in the microwave to guarantee it wouldn't overcook and the method consistently turns out perfectly cooked results. To do it yourself, simply set your fish of choice in a shallow bowl. Top it with a bit of butter or olive oil, salt, pepper and any other spices you want to use, then fill the bowl with several inches of water, cover it tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap and use a fork to poke a few holes to allow for ventilation. Then, cook on high for six to seven minutes. 4. Ripen a banana. When Buddy Valastro, owner of Buddy V's Ristorante, can't wait for a bunch of bananas to ripen enough to bake with them, he uses his microwave to speed up the process. To do it yourself, use a fork to poke holes all over the banana (this will keep it from exploding). Then, pop it in the microwave for a minute or two. 5. Melt butter or chocolate. "Softening butter and melting chocolate are two of the things that I use my microwave for the most," Mike DeCamp, executive chef and owner at the newly opened P.S. Steak in Minneapolis , tells SELF. And there's really no reason to dirty any extraneous tools for these simple tasks, Daniela Moreira, executive chef and co-owner of Call Your Mother in D.C., explains. "For melting chocolate, everybody uses the bain-marie technique, where you have to be paying attention and it takes forever," she explains, "put it in the microwave and forget about it." To avoid burning your chocolate, cook it in 30-second increments, stirring in between each time. This will help evenly disperse the heat and prevent burning. 6. Cook grains. "I love microwaving grains like rice and quinoa," Priya Krishna, author of the recently released cookbook, Indian-ish , tells SELF. "It's so easy and you don't have to use a pot," she explains, "I will microwave my grains in a glass bowl that I also use as a storage bowl, so I don't have to transfer anything," she explains. To do it yourself, combine the grains with water (according to the instructions) in a large microwave-safe glass bowl, cover with microwave-safe plastic wrap, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, checking on it every five minutes. 7. Make a quick egg dish. A brief Google search will turn up a lot of microwave egg dishes, but Fang's favorite one to make is a Japanese egg custard dish called Chawanmushi. "It's not only healthy, but also very easy to make," she explains. To make it, she says you'll need two eggs, chives, salt, water, sesame oil, and tamari (if you can't find tamari, soy sauce will also get the job done). Whisk the eggs with 2 1/2 cups water and a pinch of salt, pour them into a small, microwave-safe bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and poke a few holes for ventilation. Cook the whole thing on high for three minutes, and then top it with the chives, sesame oil, and tamari, and dig in. 8. Juice a lemon more easily. If you are having a hard time squeezing all the juice out of your lemon, try popping it in the microwave for a a bit. Sharp says that in just 15 seconds, it will release the juices more easily and lessen your workload. "Just pop a whole lemon into the microwave for 15 seconds to soften it up, give it a quick roll, and then juice," she says. 9. Cook bacon. Fang says that the microwave is also a great tool for cooking bacon, without having to worry about getting grease splatters everywhere. To do it, line a microwave-safe plate with a paper towel, top it with bacon, and cover with another paper towel (this will keep the bacon fat from getting the whole microwave dirty). Then, microwave it for 6 to 7 minutes, let cool, and dig in. 10. Whip up a quick dessert. "My favorite thing to do [with a microwave] is make cake in a coffee mug," says DeCamp. "You can have a simple, easy, and delicious dessert whenever you want without heating up the oven." You can find a few microwave mug recipes to get you started here . 11. "Bake" a potato. Krishna swears by baking potatoes in the microwave. All you need to do is put a bit of water and the potato in a bowl, and then microwave for five minutes on each side no need to rub it in olive oil, and definitely no need to turn your oven on. 12. Make a quick quesadilla. When Fang needs something quick to eat, she swears by microwave quesadillas.

BBVZkn0	finance	other	Best online brokers for day trading in May 2020	These firms provide many of the features day traders are looking for.	If you're a day trader or a prospective one, you need a brokerage that fits your needs well . Unlike casual or buy-and-hold investors -- who access the market infrequently -- day traders need to optimize for low costs and tools such as trading platforms and solid fundamental research. What is day trading? Day trading is the practice of buying and selling a security within the span of a day. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) identifies pattern day traders as those who trade in and out of a security four or more times in a five-day span, provided the number of trades are more than 6 percent of the trader's total activity in that same period. While some traders may hold positions for a few days , a typical day trader likes to be "flat" overnight - which means having all positions closed when the market closes for the day. These traders often try to avoid price movements from any change in sentiment or news that might occur overnight. Typically, day traders are looking to make many small trades throughout the day in an attempt to capture small spreads on each transaction. Day traders often take advantage of minute-by-minute moves in a security to find an attractive buy price, and when the market has firmed up they look to sell the security, sometimes only minutes later. Best online brokers for day trading in May: Fidelity   Best overall Interactive Brokers   Best for high volume Tradestation   Best for options TD Ameritrade   Best trading platform E-Trade   Best for research What to consider With a strategy that involves so much trading, one of the primary concerns for a day trader is commissions, or how much is a brokerage going to take with each trade. Regardless of whether a trade is a winner or a loser, the brokerage gets its cut either way -- both on the buy and the sell transaction. So savvy traders look to save on trading costs as much as possible, because that keeps more money in their own pockets. However, traders must balance this concern with the other features of a brokerage that may help them be successful, such as the trading platform, research and tools. So while cost is an important consideration , it's not the only one. Finally, when selecting a brokerage, day traders will find that a brokerage's typical account minimums do not apply to them. Instead, pattern day traders must maintain at least $25,000 of equity in their accounts or they will not be able to day trade, according to FINRA rules. Overview: Top brokers for day trading in May 2020 Fidelity : Best overall Fidelity Investments provides the core day-trading features well, from research to trading platform to reasonable commissions. The company's flagship platform, Active Trader Pro, offers a fully customized look while Wealth-Lab Pro, a backtesting tool, lets you test a strategy against 20 years of historical data. The research on tap is among the best in the industry, with reports from Thomson Reuters and Ned Davis, among others. For all this, you'll pay no commission on stock and ETF trades, and Fidelity also prides itself on not nickel-and-diming you on other account fees. Commissions: $0 (stocks and ETFs); $0 + $0.65 per contract (options). Interactive Brokers : Best for high volume Interactive Brokers brings a lot to the table for day traders - a well-regarded trading platform and low base commissions with the potential for discounts. And if you're placing huge trades, the broker even discounts its base commission by up to 90 percent. While Interactive Brokers isn't known for its research, its Trader Workstation platform will help technical traders with charting and streaming news. In addition, the company has recently launched IBKR Lite, a platform that gives you many of the broker's top features as well as no-commission stock and ETF trades. Commissions: $0.005 per share (stocks and ETFs) for the standard platform; $0.65 per contract (options) and volume discounts are available. TradeStation : Best for options One of TradeStation's top features is its flexible and convenient pricing plans, but the broker also offers a fantastic trading platform, too. TradeStation's base commission for options is in line with the industry standard at $0, and its commission for stocks and ETFs is now zero (on the first 10,000 shares per trade) too. TradeStation's fully customizable desktop platform allows you to use tons of technical indicators, as well as create your own. And traders will likely find OptionsStation Pro a valuable tool for setting up trades and visualizing the potential payoffs. Commissions: $0 for the first 10,000 shares per trade and $0.005 per share after that (stocks and ETFs); $0 + $0.50 per contract (options). TD Ameritrade : Best trading platform TD Ameritrade's strongest suit might just be its much-lauded thinkorswim trading platform, where in addition to stocks and options, you'll be able to trade forex, futures and futures options. You'll have access to more than 400 technical studies, and you'll have plenty of other tools (charting and a trading simulator, for example) that pro traders love. Plus, those looking for more fundamental research will find plenty. You get all this and there's no base commission. (As of November 2019, Charles Schwab has agreed to purchase TD Ameritrade , and plans to integrate the two companies once the deal is finalized.) Commissions: $0 (stocks and ETFs); $0.65 per contract (options). E-Trade : Best for research E-Trade performs well all-around, especially with a discounted commission structure on options, but the broker really shines with its range of fundamental research. Research offerings include the broker's own market commentary as well as reports from Thomson Reuters and Moody's, among others. The Power E-Trade platform and the similarly named mobile app get you trading quickly and offer more than 100 technical studies to analyze the trading action. (As of February 2020, Morgan Stanley has agreed to purchase E*Trade , and plans to operate the broker as a separate unit once the deal is finalized.) Commissions: $0 (stocks and ETFs); $0 + $0.65 or $0.50 discounted (options).

Practice good habits and saving money comes naturally. 50 Easy Things You Should Do to Save Money If it seems like the world is getting more expensive, that's because it is. The cost of consumer goods is rising, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That doesn't mean you have to give up on fun times just yet, however. There are still ways to live well in a higher-priced world. By using these strategies you can keep more of your paycheck for yourself . Click through for tips on how to survive in an expensive world   especially if you're living in one of these U.S. cities . Buy Off-Season Just because something is really expensive right now, that doesn't mean it will be in three months. "Timing is everything when it comes to shopping," said Jon Lal, founder and CEO of online coupon and cash-back website BeFrugal. "Time your purchases with the seasonality and popularity of items, and get it in the off-season or when stores have too much inventory." For instance, see the best and worst times of the year to buy a new car . Listen to More Music Listening to music can actually make you happier, according to research from the University of Missouri. Fortunately, you don't need to buy a bunch of new tunes. Instead, check out affordable music services like Spotify, where you can listen to overnight sensations like the Walmart yodeling boy   for free. Or, if you don't want ads interrupting your happiness, a premium membership is just $9.99 a month. Maintain Your Stuff A bike with rusted gears and a flat tire is not a bike   it's a space-waster. And a car that never gets its oil changed is a major credit card expense waiting to happen. Remember, a little prevention can save you a major headache   and potentially reduce big expenses down the road . Learn to Say No Your time is valuable, so learn to say no to time-wasters. That's advice Bill Gates said he got from Warren Buffett, who has the great habit of not letting his calendar fill up with useless meetings. If the meetings are mandatory, try other ways to feel more energized at work . Find a Hobby Whether it's collecting stamps, taking photos or flying model planes, a hobby could make you happier. Although the science isn't definitive, there are studies that show hobbies can improve cognitive ability. Better yet, there are plenty of hobbies that don't require a lot of money . Get Enough Sleep Studies show that regularly sleeping less than seven hours per night correlates with higher blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and depression. None of these are synonymous with living well. Buy Refurbished Electronics The price cut on refurbished items can be substantial, according to Consumer Reports. CR also cites an Accenture study that found that only 5 percent of returned electronics were actually defective, so you have a pretty good shot at scoring a virtually new laptop, TV or smartphone for a great price. Play Social Director Instead of letting your (sometimes richer, sometimes less responsible) friends choose the spots for Friday night, be proactive and choose them first. Find inexpensive places to grab that beer   it'll taste the same whether you pay $4 or $12. You can also host a cheap but impressive dinner party . Wait 24 Hours For purchases over $50, or a limit you determine based on your budget, wait 24 hours to make sure you really want it and you're getting a good deal. "You should also use that time to sleep on the decision," said Lal. "If it's something you're still thinking about after 24 hours, and you did your research, then it's a decision you're less likely to regret." Walk More A daily brisk walk can do everything from lift your mood and improve your coordination to help prevent heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, according to the Mayo Clinic. Walking also has surprising financial benefits. To get the most out of your walk, invest in an inexpensive pedometer   there are plenty under $20   or download a free weight-loss app . Travel More No one really hates vacations, but they can be pricey. So, check out discount travel sites for good deals . One site, Skiplagged, was so good at finding cheap, hidden fares that Orbitz and United Airlines actually sued the 23-year-old who started the company. Brown-Bag It to Work Ask yourself if you'd rather have those lunches out with coworkers during the week or dinner out with your significant other on the weekend. Then, buy some lunch bags. Eat More Veggies Protein is generally more expensive than plant-based foods, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, so going without it for a few dinners a week can help you save money for something more fun than pork. Veggies are also healthy, so you might just feel better, too. There's even a diet that advocates this: the Flexitarian diet. It could be your ticket to a thinner budget and waistline . Stretch Every Morning Don't just simply reach for the sky as you yawn. Practicing yoga regularly provides a myriad of benefits, a Harvard Medical School review found, from improving body image to lowering blood pressure. Live Below Your Means Spending less than what you make every month is tough, but usually doable. It also means less stress and more chances to take advantage of opportunities when they come up. Try to cut your cost of living by following tips from legendarily frugal billionaire Warren Buffett , who is also perennially happy. Floss Every Day There's strong evidence that good oral health can help your overall health. Bacteria and inflammation due to gum disease can even lead to other diseases, according to the Mayo Clinic. Not to mention that dentist visits are expensive, so grab some floss. Dress Up With Craigslist You don't have to spend top dollar to look like a million bucks. There are many ways to get designer clothes at a discount . "If you love designer brands, but can't afford the price tag, search for that designer's name on Craigslist," said Lal. "You'll be surprised at what you can find in new or very good condition." Get a Massage Sure, a massage might sound like an indulgence, but many massage schools offer massages at drastically reduced prices. By offering up your tired and knotted flesh for students to practice, you can score an hourlong massage for as little as $35. Start by finding a school near you through the American Massage Therapy Association. Laugh More Studies have shown that laughing has a wide range of health benefits. For instance, a Vanderbilt University study estimated you can burn up to 40 calories by laughing for 10 to 15 minutes a day, and a University of Maryland study found that having a sense of humor might help ward off heart disease. Meditate Every Day Just a few minutes a day of meditation could improve your life   and it's one of the cheapest ways to invest in your health . Meditation reduces anxiety and depression levels, according to a Johns Hopkins study. It also improves overall psychological well-being, according to a Harvard study. Eat More Slowly It takes about 20 minutes from the time you start eating for the brain to signal fullness. When you eat too fast, you often eat too much, according to research presented at a meeting of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity. Eat more slowly and you might lose weight, feel better and reduce expenses on food. That's a win-win-win. Eat Well: 20 Inexpensive Foods That Are Heart Healthy Wake Up Earlier Early risers feel healthier and happier than night owls, according to a study published by the American Psychological Association. Time to buy that alarm, and set it nice and early. Gossip More You read it right. A little gossip can be a healthy thing. According to research from the University of Pavia in Italy, gossip increases levels of oxytocin, the same hormone released during sex. So go ahead   you can gossip a little without being mean about it. Watch Less TV TV can be a time-waster or worse. Some studies have suggested that watching a lot of TV   for example, three hours or more a day   can lead to premature death. It's even been suggested that for people over age 25, each hour of watching TV equals 22 minutes less of life. Use Your Credit Card Less Credit cards have notoriously high interest rates and are difficult to pay down. Billionaires from Warren Buffett to Mark Cuban say to cut the plastic. If one of your goals is to build wealth, avoid going into debt with them. And if you have credit card debt, here's how to pay it off . Drive a Smaller Car Ask yourself if you really need that 6,000-pound SUV. A Toyota Prius with racks will get your surfboard, mountain bike or your kids to the fun just as well   and you can get up to triple the gas mileage doing it. That's money you can spend on living better   or a new bike. Don't Compare Yourself to Others Writing on how to live a better life, psychologist Thomas A. Richards pointed out that when you compare yourself to others, "you always tend to see yourself on the 'short end' and everyone else seems better." That's no way to live well. It might also lead to spending on things you don't need in an effort to overcompensate. Don't compare yourself to others, and you might just keep more money in your wallet. Subscribe If you want to try name-brand items without paying name-brand prices, consider signing up for subscription boxes, said Lal. And it could be a great way to live well and reduce expenses, too. "If you have room in your budget for a fixed cost each month, you can try tons of different wine, cosmetics, cheeses, coffee or clothing without paying the full price of each item," he said. If you want to try new wines, for example, Wine Club Reviews is the best place to find a club to join. Think Positive Positive thinking builds your skill set, enhances your health and improves your work, according to positive psychology researcher Barbara L. Fredrickson. That can lead to living better. Also: Positive thinking is free. Plant a Garden Gardens provide bigger benefits than just fresh veggies. Studies have found that gardening can reduce stress, improve mental health, including reducing the risk of dementia and provide low-impact exercise. Plus, those veggies are really cheap and fresh. Cheap Eats: 12 Foods You Can Easily Grow Instead of Buying at the Store Be a Good Samaritan If and when you get the chance, practice compassion. Practicing compassion helps you "enjoy better mental and physical health and speeds up recovery from disease," and might even lengthen your lifespan, according to a University of California, Berkeley publication. Cherish Your Friendships Friendship doesn't cost a penny, but it has many benefits that can enrich your life. Friendship boosts happiness while reducing stress and increases your sense of belonging, self-confidence and self-worth, according to the Mayo Clinic. Spend on Experiences You'll get more happiness from going on vacation than buying a new couch, reports The New York Times. Research has found that, in general, spending money on experiences can bring more happiness than spending on more stuff. So take a vacation … from that new couch of yours. Volunteer Giving your time to a cause can help more than the cause. Studies have shown that volunteering not only fends off loneliness and depression, but it can also offer better health, including lower blood pressure and a longer lifespan. So donate a little time, and you could get a lot back. Plus, there are ways to be an awesome human being without spending a dollar . Spend Less on Haircuts Just as with massages, barber and beauty schools often give great rates on haircuts and styling so their students can gain experience. For example, Tribeca Barber School in New York City offers men's and women's haircuts for just $6.99. This proves you can find great deals even in one of the most expensive places to live . Make It Yourself From toys and gifts to cosmetics and cleaning products, there are many costly items we could all make ourselves. It's often not only less expensive, but it can even provide a great family project. And it's all just a Google search away. Try These: Simple DIY Home Cleaners Make a Life Goals List One way to enrich your life is to have a list of life to-dos: Anything from climbing Mount Everest to writing a book to getting a dog is fair game. Experts suggest making your goals specific and attainable, or failing might do more harm than good. Bucket-list items don't have to be expensive, either. You can check off these lifetime goals for less than $10 . Read a Good Novel First of all, reading a book is one of the cheapest ways to entertain yourself. Second, research from Emory University has shown that reading a gripping novel actually creates new connections in the brain. That can only make your life richer. Don't Pay Full Price There is a way to avoid paying full price for just about anything . For serious discounts, check out services like Groupon and Living Social, as well as sites like RetailMeNot, Offers.com, Coupon Sherpa, Coupons.com, Slickdeals and others. Budget Your Happiness Make a prioritized list of things you buy with discretionary spending each month, then cut the bottom three. You'll have more to spend on the goodies and experiences you really love   or take that money and put it toward retirement. Quit the Gym Face it: You don't use your gym as much as you should. With the average monthly cost of a gym membership above $50, according to Statistic Brain Research Institute, switching the treadmill for the sidewalk and buying a few weights could be just as good for your wallet as it is for your heart rate. Instead, try out a cheap workout trend . Quit Smoking Since smoking cigarettes is so expensive   you can expect to pay at least $13 for a pack in New York City   going cold turkey could be beneficial to both your lifestyle and your life expectancy. Get serious about cutting this bad habit   and any other habits that are making you poor   and watch the savings roll in. Use a Discount Cell Service Major cellphone service providers have discount carriers that charge less for using the same towers. As long as you have a phone that works with them, you could seriously reduce expenses on your cell service. Some sub-brands are Cricket (using AT&T), Boost Mobile (Sprint) and Total Wireless (Verizon). Finding ways to cut your cost of living can help you live well. Entertain More Going out can cost you serious money. An entire bottle of wine from Trader Joe's is much cheaper than your first drink at a swanky club. Dinner and a movie, on the other hand, is much less expensive on your big screen at home. Entertaining just twice a month rather than going out could save you hundreds by the end of the year. Spend Time With Your Kids We've all heard it: Kids want your time more than the stuff you can buy them. Children who talk to their parents regularly are happier than those who don't, according to a study by the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics. Trade Your Books Most books are a one-time read. After that, they become bookcase dust collectors. So, trade them for other used books, either at a local bookstore or online at sites like PaperBack Swap. Use Your Library Libraries are a great resource not only for books but for digital books, audible books, magazines, DVDs and CDs, too. It's one of the few places where you can get some of these items for free, so take advantage. Buy Generic Most informed consumers buy generic , according to a study by economists from Tilburg University in the Netherlands and the University of Chicago. For example, nine out of 10 pharmacists and doctors buy the generic version of aspirin, which can be as much as 80 percent less expensive. And, professional chefs prefer store-brand sugar, salt and baking powder to name brands. "If it is food or a beauty product, take a look beforehand at the reviews and ingredients to make sure you're not compromising on quality," said Lal. Ask About Company Benefits You might think you're taking advantage of all your work benefits, but people are often surprised to find they aren't. Some examples of work benefits you might be missing out on are prepaid legal, long-term care or tuition-reimbursement benefits. Ask your human resources manager to find out what else your employer offers. Don't Have a Degree? These Companies Still Offer Amazing Employee Benefits Find Free Entertainment From parades and music festivals in the park to lectures at the library and fireworks shows after dark, chances are your city offers a lot of free entertainment. And, some of it is actually good. Many museums also have "free-to-the-public" days or discounted days. It can be a low-cost way to get some high culture.

Even animals do it! Discover some of the ways the spring cleaning tradition and its tools have changed, some ways they're the same as ever, and a sense of why we handle them the way we do, even biologically and scientifically.	If you're getting ready to spring clean, you're not alone   not today, or dating back generations. Even animals do it! Discover some of the ways the spring cleaning tradition and its tools have changed, some ways they're the same as ever, and a sense of why we handle them the way we do, even biologically and scientifically. Dish the Dirt Spring cleaning isn't some bygone American tradition. More than three-quarters of Americans do some spring cleaning every year, according to an industry survey, though only about a third of those respondents boast of doin the deepest cleanings . But how did this all start, and why do we still do all this cleaning today? We took a look back into the history books, and even into some biological science and psychology, to find the answer. Related: Do Diluted Detergents, Soaps, and Shampoos Still Work? Persian Tradition One of the potential roots of spring cleaning stems from Nowruz , the Persian new year that falls on the first day of spring. As Vox writer Caroline Framke shared, her family and others prepare for the new year "by doing a deep clean of their homes, celebrating a season of new life, and wishing for good luck in the year ahead." People prepare up to three weeks in advance by decluttering, cleaning out the grime, and beating the dust out of Persian rugs. The practice of khooneh takouni , literally "shaking the house," is meant "to cleanse away the past year so you can start the new one refreshed and renewed." Jewish Tradition During Passover (seven days starting April 8), Jewish tradition dictates that not only are you supposed to refrain from eating leavened or fermented food, but you're supposed to clear your home of any trace of it. In practical terms, The Kitchn's Leah Koenig explains, that means cleaning cupboards, the refrigerator, degreasing the oven, sweeping, and polishing silverware. The Orthodox Union also strongly suggests using separate food processors and mixers and cleaning out the microwave, your car, garage, clothing pockets, and even cleaning supplies. Catholic Tradition Even lifelong, multi-sacrament Catholics may not realize that Holy Thursday (April 9, the Thursday before Good Friday and Easter Sunday) is also Maundy Thursday, when churches will often wash or strip the altar in preparation for Holy Week events. While the Orthodox Church engages in "clean week" a few weeks earlier, before Lent, that is more about fasting and cleansing one's body and spirit than cleaning the house. British Tradition Mrs. Beeton's Guide to Household Management by Isabella Beeton was first published in 1861 as a guide to running a Victorian household. In it, Beeton describes the "periodical cleanings" that became associated with spring: "There are portions of every house that can only be cleaned occasionally ; at which time the whole house usually undergoes a far more thorough cleaning than is permitted in a general way. On these occasions, it is usual to begin at the top of the house and clean downwards ; moving everything out of the room; washing the wainscoting or paint with soft soap and water; pulling down the beds and thoroughly cleansing all the joints; 'scrubbing' the floor; beating feather beds, mattresses, and paillasse, and thoroughly purifying every article of furniture before it is put back in place … This general cleaning usually takes place in the spring or early summer, when the warm curtains of winter are replaced by the light and cheerful muslin curtains." What's a paillasse? A straw mattress. North American Tradition In the 1800s, annual house cleaning took place in the spring out of necessity : It was the first time it was warm enough to open windows and doors and sweep out dust, but still cool enough that you wouldn't let bugs in while doing so. When homes were heated by fireplaces and wood or coal stoves   and light came from oil or kerosene lamps   winter also left a thick layer of soot and grime to be wiped away. Consider this account from a housewife in 1864: "Swept and dusted sitting-room & kitchen 350 times. Filled lamps 362 times. Swept and dusted chamber & stairs 40 times." Frontier Tradition Texas artist and history buff Pablo Salomon, who lives in a ranch home that dates back to 1856, notes that log homes in Texas and the southern United States needed to have the spaces between the logs caked with mud to keep in the heat. When spring arrived, that mud would be removed to let air circulate . Homeowners in the region would use vinegar and herbs as disinfectants and leave windows open to let houses air out. Buddhist Tradition A New Year's celebration in Thailand with similar festivals throughout the region, Songkran (April 13-15) gives people the opportunity to not only clean house, but clean images or statues of Buddha in their homes or shrines. Water mixed with fragrant herbs and perfumes is thrown at images of Buddha to clean them, and gently poured on monks and elders, but it's also fired out of water pistols and hoses during huge, outdoor festivals. Given that it's typically very hot once Songkran comes around, some open-windowed spring cleaning and a bit of cool water isn't exactly unwelcome. Psychology "Temporal landmarks" such as the first day of spring can trigger a "fresh start effect" that makes people more motivated to accomplish goals, notes Katherine Milkman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. In fact, the simple reminder of spring kicked goal-setting habits into motion for many of Milkman's subjects in a study. "I think it's going to depend on the person and what resonates with them, but spring is a more natural fresh start for people than winter   spring is the season of rebirth and Easter, and everything is green," she says. "That's probably more psychologically resonant." Biology Humans are basically programmed to spring clean , says Anna O'Donovan at the Allergy Standards certification company. "Our pineal gland, a tiny endocrine gland buried deep in our brains, is responsible for the production of melatonin, and it is this melatonin that causes sleepiness in humans ," she says. "The pineal gland responds to darkness, increasing its production in winter and reducing its output in summer so we do actually experience an 'awakening' with the dawning of the longer days of spring." That provides a boost of energy that wakes us up earlier, gives us more motivation, and, during times when candles and lamps provided the only light, gave us a better idea of just how dirty our homes were. "Scientifically it really makes sense to clean our homes as the weather is getting warmer   the rising temperatures promote the growth of bacteria, so to prevent infection and disease, a good scouring is vital," she says. Health Dust and pet dander that accumulate during the winter don't do wonders for people with allergies . Spring is releasing all sorts of pollen outside, and a home isn't giving any relief if it's also just filled with allergens. Doctors' advice via Good Housekeeping: Don't skip spring cleaning . "Skipping is not a good idea for people with allergies or asthma," says Christine Franzese, director of allergy at University of Missouri Health Care. "Skipping it only leads to further buildup of dust and dander, which in the end will only make things worse." Animal Instinct Humans aren't the only ones driven to spring cleaning. According to National Geographic, rattlesnakes will periodically clean grass and shed skin out of their way during hunting seasons. Ants and mole rats will clean their tunnels of excrement and even of the dead, while bluebirds and crows will clean their chicks' excrement and their own homemade tools out of the nest periodically. The Trusty Broom Brooms have been around for centuries , but began to change into their modern form in 1797. That year, Levi Dickenson, a farmer in Hadley, Massachusetts, made a broom for his wife using bristles made from sorghum tassels, according to the Broom Shop. By 1810, he'd created a machine that lashed the sorghum   or broom corn   on the broom with two pegs. Shakers later replaced those pegs with wire and created the corn brooms that are still used today. Granted, there are now a lot of imports and plastic alternatives, but a solid corn broom is still key to any outdoor spring cleaning regimen. The Old Cleansers Many of the cleaners and solvents used in Britain for spring cleaning in the 19th century are worth keeping around today, says Lucy Lethbridge, author of "Spit and Polish: Old-Fashioned Ways to Banish Dirt, Dust and Decay." Borax, which is basically boric acid, works well for soaking pans, keeping towels soft, and killing household ants without toxic repercussions. Vinegar still works best for removing tea or coffee stains, rust, or to descale a coffee maker. Lemon juice, tea leaves, salt, baking soda, and even gin   it works to clean mirrors   are less harsh alternatives to modern products. Related: 14 Creative Alternatives to Household Products in Short Supply   and 4 to Skip The Old Ways Your grandmother cleaned as she went, but also did spring cleanings, Country Living says, with suggestions for applying a distinctly early 20th century cleaning sensibility to today's demands: using tea towels instead of paper; tea-staining linens instead of tossing them; and just doing something as simple as stocking a rag bin instead of throwing out clothes. It could make spring cleaning less costly . The First Vacuums Herbert Cecil Booth didn't come up with the technology to suck dirt and dust out of people's homes until the early 1900s, and even then it was a device the size of a horse-drawn carriage that would later be built into New York apartments as a central vacuum. It was a department store janitor named James Murray Spangler who used a broom, a pillowcase, and an electric motor to create the first handheld vacuum in 1907 , Popular Mechanics says. After selling one to cousin Susan Hoover and her husband, businessman William Hoover, the latter Hoover bought the patent and funded research that gave us the vacuum we know today. While still a vital spring cleaning implement, the vacuum meant that deep cleaning didn't have to be limited to spring. The First Laundry Machines Laundry was once a spring-cleaning staple, because spring was when it became warm enough to dry larger linens on a clothesline. Wooden washing machines became popular in the 1800s, but the Thor   the first electric washer   didn't debut until 1908. Maytag would follow, but wouldn't make its first washer until 1919. And J. Ross Moore didn't start selling the first electric dryer, the June Day (itself a nod to spring cleaning), until 1938; the earliest clothes dryers were drums with ventilation holes and wouldn't actually heat clothes until 1892. Related: Are You Making These Laundry Mistakes? The First Dishwashers Joel Houghton's hand-cranked wooden dishwasher was a minor marvel in 1850, but it wasn't until 1886 that wealthy Josephine Cochrane, fed up with her servants' failings, invented a mechanical dishwasher . She showed it at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and built a company to manufacture it that would later be known as KitchenAid, with dishwashers becoming a household fixture by the 1950s. The First Disinfectant Introduced in 1889 by Dr. Gustav Raupenstrauch to help end a cholera epidemic in Germany, Lysol would later be deployed around the world in 1918 to fight Spanish Influenza. But it was also used for suicides in Australia and marketed (dangerously) as both a feminine hygiene product and birth control from the 1920s through the 1940s. It became essential to spring cleaning in 1962, when it was first released as a disinfectant spray. The First Synthetic Soap Thank the World Wars for killing off natural soap. The first synthetic detergent went into use in Germany in 1916 when the fats used in soap were redirected toward the war effort. Procter & Gamble had made its Ivory soap from oils in the 1800s, but began working on synthetic soaps and detergents in the 1930s. After World War II had depleted fat supplies again, Procter & Gamble products such as Dreft began to find a market. After the war, the company released Tide detergent and, by the mid-1950s, synthetic soaps overtook oil- and fat-based products and forever changed the smell and feel of spring cleaning. The 1950s The crisp, clean, subservient domesticity that tints society's nostalgic view of the post-World War II decade has spring cleaning right at its center   there are still suggestions today about " cleaning like 1950s housewives ," complete with room-by-room checklists . Publications then such as the "Housewife's Handbook" suggested that chores that are considered deep cleaning today ("the removal of dirt from the paint, varnish, fabric, enamel, glass, metal, and other surfaces found in the home") should really be everyday activities . But this was also a time when housewives were told not to be too chatty and warned not to cook poorly or to take it personally if their spouse cheated. Hazards With chemicals in just about all household cleaning products , knowing what you're using, how high the concentration is, how to use bleach, what sprays and scents can trigger allergies and asthma, and what natural alternatives are out there is key. Also, open a window. The Marie Kondo Present Marie Kondo's book "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" seemed benign enough when it debuted in 2011, but it turned spring cleaning into a spiritual journey, building the KonMari brand around decluttering and inundating thrift stores with people's joyless items in the meantime. While storage ideas for adults and kids alike work year-round, spring's traditional spirit of renewal presents a natural opportunity to rid your life of the things that don't bring you joy … and will bring you even less when you wonder, six months from now, where you put them. Hired Help Demand for home cleaners had been surging heading into 2020, with a survey by Helping.com finding that about 40% of people ages 25 to 34 had either hired a cleaner or were looking for one, up from 33% two years earlier   and suddenly different under coronavirus rules. Older people may be shocked by the expense , but younger folks had been leaving spring cleaning to others so they could spend more time with family or accomplish other tasks. But what about the 73% of millennials who said they do their spring cleaning every year? Yes: They just didn't say they did it themselves.

Learn about home-based jobs for seniors Just because you've retired from your primary career doesn't mean you're finished working. In fact, some retirement advice is to keep working at least part time. Whether you need the money to make ends meet or are just figuring out what to do in retirement, there are options, especially work you can do from your own home . Click through to find out which jobs are perfect for retirees . Virtual Assistant You don't have to come into the office to help busy people with their smaller tasks anymore. Instead, add it to the list of jobs you can do from home and still manage to make good money . To work as a virtual assistant, you need good communication skills, a computer, a phone and internet access. Some companies prefer you have a bachelor's degree as well. Your hours depend on the role you take on. Some companies, like Belay, serve as third-party providers so you work as an independent contractor and take on tasks as you decide. Similarly, a company like Fancy Hands prices each task, and you are paid for the ones you complete. Alternatively, you might find a job working for a specific person or company as an employee   which means you could have a more structured schedule and maybe even receive benefits. In fact, many companies offer great benefits worth getting excited about. Customer Service Representative You can find a new career at 50 working from home as a customer representative. Instead of having a centralized call center, some companies opt to allow their representatives to work from home. The company saves on overhead, and you save on your commute time to and from work. To work, you need a high-speed internet connection and a landline phone. Some companies hire directly, while other companies like Sykes outsource customer support to companies in need. So you might have a full-time, part-time or seasonal job, depending on whom you work for. The median pay for customer service representatives is $15.53 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Transcriber You can get paid to transcribe audio files to Word documents thanks to this job done in the comfort of your home . To work as a transcriptionist, you need to be very detail-oriented and accurate with punctuation, grammar and spelling. In addition, you might need industry experience or manuals to make sure you know specific terminology. You might be able to land a full-time job, or you might prefer the flexibility of being a freelance transcriptionist. For example, at Rev you get to pick the jobs you want to work. And the average transcriptionist brings home an extra $245 per month. Car Rental Sales Representative If you can sell a customer on a rental car over the phone, you could land a job with Enterprise as a reservation sales representative. The car rental company does provide some work from home opportunities where you could expect to earn $12.85 per hour, plus a commission when you meet monthly sales goals, which Enterprise claims averages $250 per month. You must typically live in the general area of the store that you're serving and have at least six months of customer service experience and a year of performance or commission-based jobs. If you're hired, you'll be expected to handle 80 to 100 calls per day and work full time. Create and Sell Crafts Gone are the days when you needed to have a storefront and lots of capital to interact with potential customers.

You could launch your own website, or you could create an online store with Etsy or a similar platform. Etsy charges you a fee for each item you list, plus a commission and processing fees on the payments when your items sell. You can work as much or as little as you want. Business Consultant Just because you've retired from your main career doesn't mean you no longer have any valuable business knowledge. You can put that knowledge to work starting your own business consulting company from your den. Your experience and know-how, accumulated over decades during your working years, can prove invaluable for business owners who want to get ahead. If you create your own company , you'll have the flexibility to work when you want on the projects you enjoy, and to charge the rates you want. It also means you'll have to network with your family, friends and business connections to drum up business, however. Taking Care of Pets If you like animals, consider starting a pet sitting business from your own home. You can start from scratch or use an online platform like Rover, where you can post your profile. Of course, Rover checks all applications first. Once you're on board, you can advertise your services and set your own prices and availability. For example, you could put a size limit on pets you'll babysit in case you're no longer able to handle overly large or energetic pets on a leash. When setting your prices on a network, remember that you won't get to keep all of it. For example, on Rover, 80 percent is yours to keep, and 20 percent goes toward maintaining the site. Boost Your Income: How Your Hobbies Can Make You Money in Retirement Online Tutor If you enjoy working with students, consider online tutoring as a good job for senior citizens. You can connect with students across the country and teach the subjects you're passionate about. Plus, as an independent contractor, you can pick and choose which students you want to tutor. You can register to tutor through an online site, like Chegg, where the site claims tutors can earn $20 per hour, and the top 5 percent of tutors bring home $1,000 per month   which is almost as much as the average Social Security check . To tutor with Chegg, you need to have attended college and might need to take a proficiency exam for certain subjects. Virtual Juror Lawyers do lots of research before going to trial, including trying to figure out how potential jurors would feel if they were presented with the case. To get those opinions, they hire people to serve as pretend jurors for their cases so they can gauge whether they are likely to win, and how much a jury might award their clients in damages. Companies like Online Verdict and Jury Test let you know when there's a case that's ready for your review. After you've reviewed the case and submitted your response, you get paid   between $5 and $50 on Jury Test and between $20 and $60 on Online Verdict. Graphic Designer Working as a graphic designer makes the list of jobs for people over 50 because you can easily do it from home. If you have a computer and graphic design software, you can create logos and images for companies and organizations. It can be hard to find a full-time job in graphic design because most companies have only sporadic needs. You can use online platforms to get projects, however. For example, DesignCrowd offers contests where the winner gets paid the prize money and freelance jobs where the client selects a specific designer to work with. Internet Search Engine Rater If you thought surfing the web was a complete waste of time, you're in for a surprise. Some companies, including Lionbridge, will hire you to evaluate websites and search engine results. To qualify, you need access to a computer and internet connection. Positions are typically part time and pay hourly.

Translator If you are bilingual or fluent in multiple languages, add translator to the list of jobs for retirees. You'll need to demonstrate your fluency, such as by passing a proficiency test. If you prefer to work on your own schedule, sign up with a company like VerbalizeIt, where you can opt-in to translation jobs that suit your preferences and get paid per job. Sometimes, you'll need other skills for particular jobs. For example, Telelanguage posted an opening for a translator to work from home with medical professionals who have limited English proficiency. The job required some medical experience. If you really want to run with this job, it could provide great pay opportunities and other perks . Insurance Claims Adjuster If you have previous experience working in insurance adjusting, you could parlay that experience into a full-time job that you can do from your house. For example, a Cottingham and Butler Claims Services job posting sought senior workers comp claims adjusters with prior experience. Workers receive an allowance to pay for their home offices, equipment and tech support, plus covered business expenses. The median salary for a claims adjuster is $63,670 per year, according to the BLS. That's certainly a good way to give your income a boost.

Some nonprofits allow their fundraising directors to work remotely as long as they can accomplish all the job duties. These duties include organizing fundraising events, such as a telethon or gala, writing grant applications, maintaining donor relations and reaching out to new donors. Fundraisers are paid a median salary of $49,698 per year, according to PayScale. Click through to find out the best time to retire so you can maximize benefits .

AAyy9gw	music	music-gallery	All 20 of the Beatles No. 1 Singles, Ranked	The chart-topping songs that fueled Beatlemania	The chart-topping songs that fueled Beatlemania Where You Once Belonged On June 25, the planet comes together in celebration of World Beatles Day. (Nice to know all humans can agree on something.) Here in the U.S., John, Paul, George and Ringo landed an unprecedented total of 20 No. 1 songs in the charts. And that record has never been broken. To understand why, click though for a ranking of the Fab Four's biggest hits. 1. "Yesterday" (No. 1 for four weeks, 1965) Paul McCartney was three weeks shy of his 23rd birthday when he finished writing what is arguably the greatest, saddest ballad in the history of popular music. The somber reflection on lost love, like Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata," will resonate for generations to come. 2. "Help!" No. 1 for three weeks, 1965) This time, John Lennon really wants to hold your hand. The catchy sing-along masked the troubled Beatle's primal scream for help, with an exclamation point in the title to emphasize his sense of urgency. 3. "Something" (No. 1 for one week, 1969) George Harrison's ode to wife Pattie Boyd emerged as the undisputed A-side of the Beatles' only double-sided No. 1 single, with "Come Together." Paul McCartney described the ballad as "George's greatest song" and John Lennon hailed "Something" as the best track on the new "Abbey Road" album. But Frank Sinatra may have laid down the law when he proclaimed it "the greatest love song ever written." 4. "She Loves You" (No. 1 for two weeks, 1964) Beatlemania was built on those three little words that mean so much: "Yeah, yeah, yeah." 5. "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (No. 1 for seven weeks, 1963) Less than three months after JFK's assassination, America needed a hand to hold and from the moment the Beatles reached out on "The Ed Sullivan Show," there was no letting go. The Fab Four's first No. 1 hit in the U.S. remains their all-time best-selling single worldwide. 6. "All You Need Is Love" (No. 1 for one week, 1967) The unofficial theme song of the Summer of Love was a non-album single that would appear in late 1967 on the "Magical Mystery Tour" album as well as on 1969's "Yellow Submarine" soundtrack. The Beatles performed the anthem live at the end of the first-ever worldwide satellite broadcast, "Our World," a music special that attracted an estimated 700 million TV viewers in 14 countries. 7. "Let It Be" (No. 1 for two weeks, 1969) Paul McCartney's reassuring dream about his late mother, Mary, inspired the dirge that has been solemnly interpreted as a rock and roll hymn. "Let It Be" was the second consecutive modern-day spiritual to top the charts, following the six-week run of Simon & Garfunkel's magnum opus, "Bridge Over Troubled Water." 8. "A Hard Day's Night" (No. 1 for two weeks, 1964) Ringo Starr's impromptu assessment of a grueling studio session prompted the title track of the Beatles' first movie. John Lennon wrote the music and lyrics that night. The next morning, the band cranked out the rollicking recording in less than three hours. The ninth take proved to be the winner. 9. "I Feel Fine" (No. 1 for two weeks, 1964) Yet another example of the Beatles whipping up a hit that's both obviously derivative and completely original. Ringo Starr copped the drum lick from Ray Charles' "What'd I Say," John Lennon and George Harrison reworked a riff from "Watch Your Step," a 1961 single by R&B guitarist Bobby Parker, and Paul McCartney's initial bass note got hijacked by feedback from Lennon's guitar. Like a fuse, the electric hum served as the ditty's introduction, showcasing the first use of feedback on a record. "It was a found object," said McCartney, "an accident caused by leaning the guitar against the amp." 10. "Paperback Writer" (No. 1 for two nonconsecutive weeks, 1966) The song that John Lennon once described as "son of 'Day Tripper'" delivered a stream of chatty lyrics over a single thrumming chord and Paul McCartney's prominent, impressively busy bass line. Written as an aspiring author's cover letter to a prospective publisher, "Paperback Writer" was the first Beatles' hit that had nothing to do with their favorite subject: love. 11. "Ticket to Ride" (No. 1 for one week, 1965) Even better than George Harrison's indelible 12-string guitar riff is Ringo Starr's stagger-step drumbeat, a sophisticated give-and-go that laid waste to the idiotic notion that Ringo wasn't an especially skilled drummer. A similar pattern would be employed again a few months later on John Lennon's reflective ballad "In My Life." 12. "Eight Days a Week" (No. 1 for two weeks, 1965) Another Beatles' hit, another studio innovation. The slow fade-in of John Lennon and George Harrison's jangling acoustic and electric guitars marked the first time the technique was ever used to launch a pop song. "Eight Days a Week" went on to become the quartet's seventh No. 1 single in 12 months, a record that has yet to be broken. 13. "Can't Buy Me Love" (No. 1 for five weeks, 1964) The Beatles' third consecutive No. 1 single in 1964 extended their stay in the pop chart penthouse to a fourth month. Following in the tracks of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and "She Loves You," the band reigned over the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 consecutive weeks in the winter and spring of 1964. 14. "Penny Lane" (No. 1 for one week, 1967) Paul McCartney's trippy stroll down memory lane paid homage to the sights and sounds on the Liverpool street near his childhood home. Backed on the B-side by Lennon's even trippier "Strawberry Fields Forever," "Penny Lane" was the Beatles' first No. 1 single since their TV alter egos, the Monkees, exploded on the music scene with their first two chart-topping hits, "Last Train to Clarksville" in late 1966 and "I'm a Believer" in January 1967. 15. "Get Back" (No. 1 for five weeks, 1969) Billy Preston became the first artist to earn co-star status on a Beatles record when he played piano on the freewheeling tune that John Lennon characterized as a revamped "Lady Madonna." "Get Back" and its B-side, "Don't Let Me Down" officially credited to "The Beatles with Billy Preston" was the first Beatles single to be released in "true stereo" in the U.S., with Ringo Starr's drums mixed across the left and right channels. 16. "We Can Work It Out" (No. 1 for three nonconsecutive weeks, 1966) The dichotomy between Paul McCartney and John Lennon was more obvious than ever in this harmonium-infused collaboration inspired by McCartney's shaky relationship with British actress Jane Asher. "You've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out/We can work it out' real optimistic, y'know," Lennon observed, "and me, impatient: 'Life is very short, and there's no time/For fussing and fighting, my friend.'" Recorded during the "Rubber Soul" sessions, "We Can Work It Out" was paired with Lennon's "Day Tripper" on the Beatles' first-ever double-sided single. Not surprisingly, Lennon and McCartney disagreed over which song should be promoted as the A-side. Radio stations sided with McCartney. 17. "Hey Jude" (No. 1 for nine weeks, 1968) The Beatles' debut single on their Apple Records label was their lengthiest hit, clocking in at a lucky 7:11, the longest song to ever top the Billboard Hot 100. (Three years later, Don McLean's "American Pie" would extend the mark to 8:33.) "Hey Jude"  written by Paul McCartney to John Lennon's son Julian during his parents divorce was also the band's most dominant chart-topper, reigning at No. 1 for a then record-tying nine weeks. As the years roll on, however, it seems clear that the single's B-side is the song destined to remembered as an indisputable classic: "Revolution." 18. "The Long and Winding Road" (No. 1 for two weeks, 1970) The Beatles' final single and No. 1 hit was released a month after the band broke up. Paul McCartney wrote it as a melancholy piano number in the style of Ray Charles and was outraged when producer Phil Spector repaved "The Long and Winding Road" with a 22-piece orchestra and a choir of 14 women, supposedly to cover up John Lennon's "crude" bass playing. McCartney's stripped-down version would eventually surface on the 2003 alternative mix, "Let It Be…Naked." 19. "Hello Goodbye" (No. 1 for three weeks, 1967-1968) A solid year of Monkeemania may have sparked the silliness of Paul McCartney's exercise in word association and its slapstick coda. If so, the move paid off in more ways than one. "Hello Goodbye" dislodged the Monkees' "Daydream Believer" from No. 1 after a four-week run. Hello goodbye, Fab Faux. 20. "Love Me Do" (No. 1 for one week, 1964) The Beatles' debut single in England took two years to make its way across the pond, where it became the fourth of their six No. 1 hits in 1964. Lennon's campfire harmonica set up the two-part lead vocal he shared with Paul McCartney, an homage to the harmonies of the Everly Brothers. What was once "Bye Bye Love" was now "Love, love me do."

Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder and all, but when it comes to cities, pretty much everyone can agree that dazzling skylines, lush gardens, tree-lined boulevards, and any kind of water view are key factors in deeming a city one of the most beautiful in the world. Read on to see which cities topped our list, then do a quick place search on Instagram to see what we're talking about. 1) Buenos Aires   Argentina One of the most photographed spots in the Argentinian capital is Plaza de Mayo , a gorgeous public square, lined with historic buildings, including the presidential palace. The city is also known for its wide tree-lined avenues, street art, tango shows in the La Boca neighborhood, and Recoleta Cemetery , where Evita is buried. More: Here Are the Most Beautiful Places in the World   How Many Have You Been To? 2) Dubrovnik   Croatia This stunningly beautiful walled city on the Adriatic Sea has medieval roots, so it's no surprise that it doubled as King's Landing in Game of Thrones . Wander its cobbled streets, explore historic monasteries and Renaissance churches, dine in outdoor cafes, and kick back on beaches like Banje, just outside the town walls. 3) Vancouver   Canada Vancouver is a gorgeous coastal city surrounded by water and mountains. Down by the harbor, you'll marvel at the array of sailboats, ferries, cruise ships   even seaplanes   vying for space on the water. There's also Stanley Park , trendy Gastown, shop-lined Robson Street, and some of the best sushi this side of Tokyo. 4) Santa Fe   New Mexico Santa Fe is famous for its adobe architecture, art galleries, and museums (the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum is a must), not to mention its delicious Southwestern cuisine. The city also has a growing farm-to-table scene and countless spots for margaritas. Plus, its high desert landscape, especially scenic at sunset, is perfect for hiking. 5) Hong Kong   China There are few skylines in the world that can compete with Hong Kong's . The city's soaring skyscrapers   dazzlingly lit up at night   are framed by Victoria Harbour , which is teeming with Star Line ferries and traditional junk boats. For a bird's-eye view of this unforgettable scene, head to one of the city's many rooftop bars. 6) Rio de Janeiro   Brazil During the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Janeiro showed the world its singular beauty. Insta-worthy attractions include the Christ the Redeemer statue , perched high on a hilltop, and bullet-shaped Sugarloaf Mountain on Guanabara Bay. And, of course, you can't talk about Rio without mentioning iconic Copacabana Beach . 7) Copenhagen   Denmark It's easy to fall in love with Copenhagen, one of the world's most postcard-perfect cities. Its prettiest street is Nyhavn , lined with brightly colored historic buildings on one side and a canal on the other, and Amalienborg Palace, the royal family's residence, is nearby. The best way to get around is by bicycle, just like the locals. 8) New York   New York The Big Apple is famous for its skyline, with iconic buildings like the Empire State and Chrysler, but many may not know that NYC has lesser-known sights that are just as beautiful, including the waterfront promenade in Brooklyn Heights and the 19th-century brownstones in the Greenwich Village Historic District. Plus, it has some of the best restaurants on the planet. 9) Istanbul   Turkey Istanbul is one of the world's most intoxicating cities. It sits on two continents, Europe and Asia, and it was also the former capital of three great empires: Byzantine, Roman, and Ottoman. It's a mix of east and west, old and new, and it's where you'll find ancient mosques and bazaars alongside trendy hotels and cocktail bars on the Bosphorus. 10) San Miguel de Allende   Mexico The beauty of San Miguel de Allende , a Spanish colonial city in Mexico's hilly interior, has long attracted American and Canadian expats. They, like all visitors, fall for its cobbled streets, tree-lined El Jardin square, craft markets, and architecturally-rich buildings like the Parroquia, the massive 17th-century cathedral. 11) San Francisco   California As one of the prettiest cities on the planet, you're never far from jaw-dropping views while in San Francisco . Whether it's the Golden Gate Bridge shimmering in the bay, a cable car descending a steep hill, or seaside tableaus along its piers, plan on taking a lot of photos! Plus, it's the gateway to the wineries of Napa Valley . 12) Bangkok   Thailand You'll never tire of gazing at the exquisite Buddhist temples ( wats ) in Bangkok . One of the Thai capital's most famous ones is Wat Pho, featuring the gilded Reclining Buddha. Other must-sees while in this exotic city include the Grand Palace and the fragrant flower market . Plus, after exploring, a Thai massage awaits. 13) Bath   England While London could certainly make any list of the world's most beautiful cities, don't overlook Bath in southwest England. Jane Austen lived and wrote here, no doubt inspired by the grand Georgian architecture, the old Roman baths, and the proximity to rolling hills. 14) Zurich   Switzerland Zurich is a top finance center, but don't be fooled into thinking this Swiss city is just sleek buildings and buttoned-up bankers. Zurich's Old Town is filled with beautiful Baroque buildings, charming bridges spanning the Limmat River, and buzzy outdoor cafes. You can also shop along the elegant Bahnhofstrasse and take a scenic boat cruise around Lake Zurich. 15) Cartagena   Colombia Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coast, is very much an up-and-coming city. Visitors are attracted to the beauty of its walled Old City, filled with Spanish colonial architecture, cobbled streets, cevicherias , and salsa clubs, which stay open till the wee hours. Feeling a bit groggy? It's nothing a cup of strong Colombian coffee can't cure. 16) Singapore Not only is Singapore one of the cleanest and most orderly cities in the world, but its skyline (including the massive Marina Bay Sands complex), bay views, and lush gardens make it one of the most beautiful as well. Plus, thanks to its Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese, and Indian influences, it's also one of Asia's leading foodie centers. 17) Edinburgh   Scotland Edinburgh Castle, the 900-year-old hilltop fortress that dominates this Scottish city, is worth the trip alone. Another top attraction is the Royal Mile , which is lined with kilt-making shops and historic pubs, where a stop for a wee dram of single-malt whisky is a must. 18) Essaouria   Morocco While many travelers know Marrakech , Essaouira is a beautiful, laid-back city on Morocco's eastern coast. The medina, enclosed by 18th-century ramparts, is a network of whitewashed houses with aqua shutters, arched doorways, and tiny alleys. Unwind on the town beach and dine in no-frills seafood stands on the harbor. 19) St. Petersburg   Russia Founded by Peter the Great in 1703, St. Petersburg has a grandeur that few cities in Europe can match. Expect Baroque palaces, gold-domed churches, and top-tier museums like the Hermitage , where you can ogle the Imperial jewels and other treasures. In the restaurants along Nevsky Prospekt, try the local caviar and vodka. 20) Sedona   Arizona One glimpse of the otherworldly landscape in Sedona, and you'll know why it's consistently ranked as one of the world's most beautiful places . Spend your days hiking, biking, or taking a Pink Jeep adventure amid the spectacular Red Rock formations   then you've earned that margarita on a patio during sunset. 21) Budapest   Hungary Architecture buffs know that the Hungarian capital, bisected by the Danube River, has some of the most beautiful buildings in Europe, including the baroque-style castle and the gothic-style Parliament. The city is also famous for it thermal baths, such as the elegant Gellért Baths , with both indoor and outdoor pools. 22) Cusco   Peru Cusco is a launching off point for trips to Machu Picchu , but stick around a few extra days to discover the myriad of charms of this ancient city, once the capital of the Incan empire. Highlights include its Spanish colonial buildings, bustling Plaza de Armas square, and colorful Andean craft markets and foods stalls. 23) Kyoto   Japan Long considered Japan's most beautiful city, Kyoto is known for its Buddhist temples, including Kinkaku-ju , built in the 14th century and covered in gold leaf, which shimmers during sunset. It also boasts Shinto shrines, Zen gardens, and traditional ryokan inns. You can also discover the fascinating world of geishas in the Gion district. 24) Cape Town   South Africa Cape Town , with its glorious sea vistas and flat-topped Table Mountain, has long been known as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and now, with the new Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa , you can get your culture fix, too. This contemporary art museum, housed in a former grain silo, is devoted exclusively to African art and artists. 25) Bordeaux   France Bordeaux is not only France's wine capital with hundreds of scenic vineyards offering world-class sipping, but the city itself is also a destination in its own right. Sitting on the banks of the Garonne River, you'll find medieval architecture, museums, galleries, and plenty of cozy wine bars and Michelin-starred restaurants. 26) Charleston   South Carolina One of the first things people want to do after a visit to Charleston is to plan a return trip. They're seduced by its cobbled alleys and antebellum mansions in the historic district, but this Southern belle isn't stuck in the past, as it's one of the country's top foodie destinations , offering low-country cuisine with a modern twist. 27) Venice   Italy It seems like a cliché, but how can you have a story on the world's most beautiful cities and not include Venice? From its gondola-filled canals and iconic stone bridges to its frescoed churches and hand-blown glass shops (not to mention trattorias and gelaterias!), there's no denying the global appeal of the City on the Canals. 28) Sydney   Australia Has there ever been a more beautiful harbor? We don't think so. Stunningly framed by the white "sails" of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, the panorama never gets old. The city also has plenty of hip neighborhoods to explore like Surry Hills and Darlinghurst, plus world-famous beaches like Bondi to kick back on. 29) Chicago   Illinois Other U.S. cities may get more attention, but Chicago is second to none when it comes to architecture   the skyscraper was born here, after all. Plus, it has killer Lake Michigan views, parks galore (Millennium, Lincoln, and more), the Art Institute of Chicago, home of masterpieces like American Gothic and Nighthawks , and last but not least, deep-dish pizza. 30) Quebec City   Quebec Quebec City, founded in 1608 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain on the St. Lawrence River, is like a little slice of France north-of-the-border. The city's most beautiful section is the walled Old City (Vieux Quebec), known for its 19th-century buildings and cobbled lanes lined with bistros, boulangeries, and boutiques. 31) Pin It for Later!

BBN7eiN	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	How to Cook the Perfect Scrambled Eggs	What's better than heading into the kitchen and whipping up some fluffy eggs for breakfast? Here's how to make the best scrambled eggs.	There's nothing more uplifting than seeing a golden plate of light and fluffy scrambled eggs when you wake up in the morning. Granted, they are super versatile and can be cooked many ways from fried, poached, hard-boiled, to even an omelet. But going with scrambled is always a classic choice. Forking into a pile of custardy, golden goodness, though, comes with a little technique and cooking knowledge. To start, you'll need to make sure you have some high-quality eggs. We recommend choosing grade AA eggs because they have the best ratios of thick whites to rounded yolks. Then, you'll need a whisk. The whisk is one of the most underrated cooking tools out there, but it's the secret to whipping up fluffy goodness. And if you're looking for more, be sure to check out How to Cook the Perfect Eggs for Every Cooking Method to really master the art of making eggs the right way! And now for the big reveal… How to get the best scrambled eggs: Whip your eggs. By whisking your eggs, you incorporate air, which gives your sunny scramble a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Be sure to whip the egg yolk and whites together evenly so that there aren't any streaks in the mixture. Season your eggs with your choice of spices. We like ours with a little kick, so in addition to salt and ground black pepper, we like to add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Place a nonstick skillet on the stove, and melt some grass-fed butter (about half a tablespoon) in it under medium-low heat. We think medium-low is the best temperature for achieving a light, airy scramble. After allowing the butter to fully melt into the pan, pour your egg batter in and let it sit for a few seconds. Add your chopped veggies or shredded cheese before folding the eggs with a plastic spatula. Be sure to lightly push the eggs off the skillet and let it stir in the pan until bigger curds form. Pro tip: Kill the heat before your eggs are all cooked through. This helps you avoid overcooking them and turning them into a rubbery mess. Now, grab a plate and fork and lightly season the eggs again with pepper and salt before digging in! Check out these other mind-blowing ways to use your eggs if you're looking to get even more creative. RELATED VIDEO: This is the Best Way to Reheat Pizza, No It's not the Microwave! (via Buzz60)

AAyeTVF	travel	ads-cancun	Best of culture in Cancun	Think of Cancun and margaritas are more likely to come to mind than museums, but these days, visitors will never be far away from a culture fix, whether it's a relic-filled museum or some underwater art.	Think of Cancun and margaritas are more likely to come to mind than museums, but these days, visitors will never be far away from a culture fix, whether it's a relic-filled museum or some underwater art. Cobá Archaeologists at Cobá have their work cut out   it's believed they've only uncovered a handful of the 6,500 structures at this ancient Mayan site. In its heyday, the city, which is a two-hour drive south from Cancun, was home to around 100,000 people. Highlights include the Nohoch Mul pyramid (the tallest on the Yucatan Peninsula), and if you muster the energy to climb its 120 steps you'll enjoy spectacular views of the surrounding temple-filled forests. Head here in the morning to spot butterflies, tiger monkeys and brightly-colored birds perching on the knotty branches of the ceiba trees. Museo Maya de Cancun Had your fill of Mayan ruins? Consider a visit to Cancun's most popular museum, instead. You'll find a breathtaking collection of artefacts collected from all over the state of Quintana Roo, and there's even an archaeological site on the grounds   San Miguelito, where you'll find a cluster of restored Mayan structures. Of less archaeological significance but equally instagram-able are the enormous iguanas you'll spot scampering around the site. Museo Subacuático de Arte (MUSA) The best bit about this museum? There's not a stern-faced security guard or "do not touch sign" in sight. Artist Jason DeCaires Taylor created this attraction as a way to offset the damage caused to coral by divers and fishing boats. Comprising over 500 sculptures designed to promote coral growth, the underwater museum can be explored on glass-bottomed boat tours, although you can snorkel over it, too. The statues were inspired by people who lived in a local fishing village   look out for the angst-ridden gentleman (and his dog) slouched behind a desk, and the six businessmen with their heads buried in the sand. La Pitahaya La Pitahaya is a hidden gem of a gallery, tucked into a building on Cancun's Avenida Yaxchilán. It's a favourite hangout for locals, making it a great option for those keen to take time out from Cancun's busiest tourist drags. You'll find colorful artwork by some of the region's top artists, and there's a café filled with beautiful books about the local art scene. Feeling creative? Sign up for one of the regular sculpture or painting workshops, or attend one of the gallery's poetry or musical recitals. Xcaret Let's face it. Dragging kids around museums can quickly become a chore   for all involved. That's where Xcaret, just south of Cancun, comes in. The best way to describe it is as a Mexico-themed amusement park, complete with replicas of a traditional hacienda, Mayan village and flag-draped Mexican cemetery. It's also one of the region's most environmentally-friendly attractions, and was the world's first theme park to be awarded the International Earthcheck's Gold Certificate for sustainable tourism and environmental practices. Xoximilco Cancun Xoximilco is one of Cancun's liveliest (and most unusual) party spots. Although it's just a 15-minute drive from Cancun, making your way to this UNESCO World Heritage site is a feat in itself, due to its location, in the middle of the jungle. You'll then enjoy a traditional Mexican carnival, before boarding a flower-adorned Mexican gondola and drifting along pre-Hispanic waterways to a soundtrack of traditional Mexican music, courtesy of an onboard mariachi band. Bring mosquito repellent, long trousers and your sturdiest dancing shoes. Street art tour Cancun is quickly emerging as one of the world's top street art destinations. Some of the best murals can be found on Avenida Bonampak, where you'll find pieces by world-renowned street artists such as Nychos, Spok, Smithe, Curiot and Fintan Magee. Calle Margaritas is home to a spectacular collaboration between artists Areuz, Guri and Felipe Cespedes. For more information on the location of murals, check out the websites of the organisations helping develop the city's street art scene. This includes World Art Destinations, Proyecto Panorama and Varios Barrios. Museo de la Isla de Cozumel Perhaps unsurprisingly, given its name, this museum can be found on the island of Cozumel, which is a great option for a day trip. It covers a wide range of subjects, and exhibits are laid out in a clear, easy-to-follow order, making it ideal for younger visitors. The main focus is the island's geography, fauna and flora (Cozumel is famous for its diversity of all three). The exhibits which focus on the coral reefs surrounding the island are fascinating; if you're heading to the island to dive, a stop-off will give you a whole new perspective on Cozumel's coral reefs before you take the plunge. Enjoy culture and relaxation in Cancun in the new Grand Palladium Costa Mujeres Resort & Spa , a stylish 5-star beachfront hotel located on the Mexican Caribbean offering luxury living and adventure at the nearby ancient ruins of the Mayan civilisation.

AAAW0DF	news	newsworld	Do you say happy Ramadan? What you need to know about Ramadan 2019	Ramadan, the most important month of the year in the Muslim calendar, begins Sunday, May 5, and ends Tuesday, June 4.	Ramadan, the most important month of the year in the Muslim calendar, begins Sunday. For the next 30 days, Muslims around the world will abstain from eating or drinking during daylight hours . Here's everything you need to know about why Muslims celebrate, how to wish someone a happy Ramadan and what happens at the end of the month. What is Ramadan? For Muslims, the monthlong celebration commemorates Allah, the Arabic name for God, giving the first verses of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, to the prophet Muhammad in the year 610 A.D. For 30 days, Muslims around the world do not eat from dawn to dusk, pray intensely and gather for nightly feasts to break the fast. Observing Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, the five duties that are obligatory for every Muslim. When is Ramadan in 2019? The date of Ramadan varies each year and is determined by the cycles of the moon. Ramadan is the ninth month of the lunar Islamic calendar, and it officially begins the morning after the crescent moon is visible to the naked eye . But since the moon's visibility in different parts of the world varies based on weather and geography, in many areas, Ramadan does not officially start until religious leaders declare they've seen the crescent moon. April 18: What's it like dating as a young Muslim American? Hulu's 'Ramy' shows hard, funny truths March 12: From Lent to Ramadan, what religious fasts mean In 2019, Ramadan will begin at sunset on Sunday, May 5, and last through sundown on Tuesday, June 4. In 2020, it will begin April 23, and in 2021, April 12. Do you say 'Happy Ramadan?' Yes, a non-Muslim may wish someone a "Happy Ramadan." But Muslims typically don't say that to each other. The Arabic greeting is "Ramadan Mubarak," which means "Happy Ramadan, " or "Have a blessed Ramadan." Another is "Ramadan Kareem," which means "Have a generous Ramadan." Why do Muslims fast? Ramadan is a month of spiritual dedication and personal growth. It is intended to strengthen Muslims' relationship with God. Ramadan 2018: Why are Muslims fasting? What you need to know about Ramadan Muslims around the world give up earthly pleasures, focus on prayer and read the Quran . Many also donate to charities and hunger relief efforts. When do Muslims fast? Muslims fast from sunrise, known as suhoor, to sunset, known as iftar. Observers eat a pre-dawn meal before sunrise (common foods include energy-dense dates, mashed fava beans or potatoes ) and another after sunset (typically a feast with family and friends). What can Muslims eat or drink? Nothing during daylight hours. According to the Islamic Association of Raleigh , taking one sip of water invalidates the day's fast, which must then be made up at a later date. However, eating or drinking because of forgetfulness or coercion are exceptions, and the person's fast remains valid. Muslims can shower, apply eye drops, take injections or brush their teeth during daylight hours as long as nothing is swallowed. How do Muslims break the fast? Muslims typically sip water and eat dates before performing sunset prayers. They then share an "iftar" feast with friends and family . Many mosques host free iftar meals for the public during Ramadan. Does every Muslim have to fast? Yes, with some exceptions. Children under 13 who haven't yet reached puberty, women who are menstruating, sick people, elderly people, pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers and travelers are exempt. Can you smoke cigarettes or vape during Ramadan? Ramadan is not only about fasting from food and drink, but also abstaining from other types of pleasures, including sex, swearing and arguing . Many Muslims give up smoking and drinking alcohol as a means of spiritual purification during the month. Can you kiss during Ramadan? Yes. According to the Islamic Association of Raleigh , it is acceptable for spouses to kiss during Ramadan "as long as one is able to control oneself." What about working out during Ramadan? Many Muslims who choose to exercise during Ramadan do so right before sunset , just before breaking the day's fast. Mid-day workouts are uncommon due to not being able to eat or drink during daylight hours. Professional athletes who travel aren't required to fast, but some, such as professional soccer player Mohamed El-Munir of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club , choose to do so. What happens at the end of Ramadan? The month concludes with a three-day celebration known as Eid al-Fitr, or the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast. Gifts are exchanged, and children often receive cash and new clothing. One Muslim writer likens it to "the Muslim version of Christmas."

AAzW6h1	autos	autosmidsize	2018 Mazda 6	The latest, enhanced version of a mainstream sedan that thinks it's an entry-luxury car.	Overall Rating: The Mazda 6 is more than an ordinary mid-size family sedan. Its chiseled body and beautiful cabin could easily be confused with those of much pricier cars. Likewise, its fantastic chassis delivers a driving experience that is normally reserved for expensive sports sedans. Collectively, these traits create an extraordinary blend of upscale ambience and unsurpassed dynamics that is surprisingly affordable. Instead of offering individual options, Mazda requires buyers to look to higher trim levels in order to get the features they want. The Mazda 6 won't win many objective comparisons with its competitors; after all, it's not the quickest, thriftiest, or tech-savviest. But this marvelous sedan transcends the numbers and targets the senses better than its "mainstream mid-size family car" classification suggests. What's New for 2018? For the third time in five model years, the Mazda 6 receives a makeover for 2018 . Its most obvious updates include subtly evolved exterior styling, a refreshed interior, and an additional engine option. The 6's new turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder slots above the standard naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four, which adopts cylinder deactivation and adds slightly more horsepower and torque. While these changes are significant, Mazda took things a step further by retuning the chassis and drastically reducing interior noise levels. The lineup also welcomes a new Grand Touring Reserve trim and a top-of-the-line Signature model. The latter has rich leather, real wood trim, and a long list of desirable standard features. What Was New for 2017? Mazda's clever G-Vectoring Control -an electronic method for enhancing steering response by inducing subtle load transfer to the front axle in response to steering-wheel inputs-was introduced across the entire lineup. Sport and Touring trim levels received thicker front-door glass, while the Grand Touring got even quieter acoustic laminated glass; every 6's weather seals and sound attenuation were optimized for lower sound levels. The i-Activsense safety bundle can now detect and react to pedestrians, read traffic signs, and automatically brake from speeds of up to 99 mph. A new Premium package for the Grand Touring trim upped the 6's already impressive luxury game with special leathers, stitching, and more. Trims and Options We'd Choose Previously, we chose the Mazda 6 Touring with the six-speed manual transmission and a respectable set of standard features. However, for 2018, the manual gearbox is now only available on the base Sport model. While its $22,845 starting price is enticing, Mazda eliminates any options so that all upgrades are unlocked by higher trim levels. Still, the Sport has desirable standard features such as: • Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, low-speed forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking • Leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob • 8.0-inch Mazda Connect touchscreen • Dual-zone automatic climate control Those who want a little more luxury should consider the Touring model ($26,595). It adds 19-inch wheels, leatherette-trimmed seats, heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver's seat, passive entry, and even more active-safety features such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. We still prefer the manually shifted Sport version, but the automatic-only Touring model is also an impressive value for this class. If you'd like your 6 with an interior that could pass for that of an Audi A4 or BMW 3-series, order up the top-spec Signature edition. It comes with upholstery in leather and faux suede, Japanese Sen wood trim, and a full load of extras-it's gorgeous and still a reasonable $35,645.

BBOwH0B	foodanddrink	tipsandtricks	Can This Cast-Iron Skillet Be Saved?	Yup, and so can some of my faith in humanity	I needed a win this week. I imagine so many of us did, for reasons both public and political and intensely private. It's so hard being a person. I needed a problem I could actually fix, and one found me. I recently came into possession of a chicken shed filled with terrible things: damp cushions, a couple dozen open cans of paint, improperly sealed canisters of oil, rotten wooden furniture, and a couple of badly-rusted cast-iron skillets . I hauled what I could to a dumpster and am still mulling over paint disposal, but the pans or at least one of them felt like a mission. The larger of the two was cracked irreparably across the bottom, and I said farewell. But the smaller I had to at least try to salvage it. It was caked with rust and filled with damp and indefinable matter (some of which was wiggling). In other words, it was an ideal distraction from upsets both deep inside me and infiltrating the very air we're all breathing, culturally speaking. I brought it into my kitchen to rinse, wipe, and assess the state of things, and of course post pictures on Twitter and Instagram, asking people, Can this skillet be saved? The response was immediate and way more enthusiastic than I could have anticipated. Send it out for sandblasting. Throw it in a deep fryer. Throw it in a bonfire. Use the electrolysis method. Use a drill and a wire brush. Send it to me and I'll fix it. I knew only one thing: That I was going to bring this pan back from the dead, and I was going to revive it with my own muscle. As I replied to more than one person, I have rage, salt, baking soda, steel wool, biceps, ADHD medication , and very little fear of fire. (And also a masters degree in metalsmithing, which I rarely get to deploy these days.) So first, I scrubbed. Time flaked away as I threw in fistsful of salt and baking soda, relaxed my jaw, and clutched a plain steel wool pad in my right hand and the handle in the other. I bore down hard in spirals, loops, and stubborn lines. I probably grunted a little. A physically-driven fugue state is a rare luxury for me these days, and I'll take the break from my own head when I can get it. I could see the neglect of years sloughed away by the weight of will, but still it wasn't enough. Time for fire. My friend Drew Robinson is a pitmaster, and he knows from metal and flame. He said to throw it in my oven on the self-cleaning cycle, so I did just that. I opened the door to the backyard, pointed a stand fan toward it, and cleared out while the kitchen filled up with smoke. I came back to a still-filthy phoenix, surrounded by a radius of rust. Still so much further to go. But the world is sometimes unexpectedly kind if you let it be. I posted pictures of the progress, and to my great delight, people on Twitter and Instagram shared their advice and encouragement. It's sometimes easier to get emotionally invested in something outside yourself with a definitive physical goal than in something with an end still beyond the horizon (or actually consequential). I wasn't trying to hammer out a bipartisan solution for healthcare, appoint a Supreme Court justice, or end centuries of systemic gender inequality just trying to clean a pan, man. I kept scrubbing. More baking soda, more salt, the occasional douse of vinegar. Eventually, the paper towels I was using to wipe away the debris began to come away cleaner and cleaner until the soot turned to rust red, and then turned to nearly nothing. Time to season. Also on Drew's advice, I bought flaxseed oil, and while the oven crept up to 500°F, I rubbed it into the skillet's surface as evenly and thinly as I could. The metal was thirsty in places, fuller in others, and I took my time. Slid it onto the center rack, waited a while, more oil. Back in the heat five more times until the surface was hard and almost glassy, and the metal told me it could drink no more. When the skillet was cool, I picked it up. It was still heavy and hard, but somehow one with my hands. I transformed this iron object with the force of fire and my muscles and my will, and I made it mine. And also sort of everyone's. Here you go, strangers and friends. I hope you like her. Share our victory.
BBMVhJ9	foodanddrink	beverages	Here's the Difference Between Seltzer, Soda, and Tonic Water	Tonic water, seltzer, club soda, sparkling, and mineral: There are so many different fizzy waters out there, but are they all the same thing?	Tonic water, seltzer, club soda, sparkling, and mineral: There are so many different fizzy waters out there, but are they all the same thing? Carbonated water : water into which carbon dioxide has been dissolved - is a broad term that encompasses all fizzy waters. It's used interchangeably with sparkling water and soda water (a prewar term for the same thing). Within this category, there are several distinctions: seltzer, club soda, tonic, and mineral water. Seltzer water : artificially produced by passing pressurized carbon dioxide through water. Seltzer contains no added ingredients or flavorings. Club soda : like seltzer, is artificially produced by passing pressurized carbon dioxide through water, but contains additives such as table salt, sodium bicarbonate, or potassium bicarbonate to add a slightly salty flavor. Tonic water : again, artificially produced by passing pressurized carbon dioxide through water, but with the addition of quinine (originally used in the 19th century to prevent malaria) that produces a slightly bitter taste. Now, most tonic water also has citric acid and added sweeteners. Mineral water : like Perrier or San Pellegrino, contains naturally occurring carbonation and minerals. Since it's bottled directly from a natural source, it tends to be pricier and has a more delicate effervescence than other carbonated waters. For these reasons, it's typically enjoyed alone, rather than used as a drink mixer. What's your sparkling water of choice?

However, its tight rear seats and unwieldy navigation system keep it from ranking higher than the middle of the class.	The 2013 Audi A3 has engaging road manners, a smooth ride, and excellent safety scores. However, its tight rear seats and unwieldy navigation system keep it from ranking higher than the middle of the class. The 2013 Audi A3 is ranked: #6 in 2013 Luxury Small Cars #13 in 2013 Hatchbacks #15 in Used Hatchbacks $12K to $15K #36 in Used Luxury Small Cars under $20K Is the 2013 Audi A3 a Good Used Car? A used 2013 Audi A3 is a good choice among luxury small cars . It's fun to drive, and it has a comfortable ride and better crash test ratings than many of its rivals. However, Audi's entry-level car is not for everyone. It has limited rear-seat space and cumbersome tech features. Also, Audi A3 TDI models struggle to keep up on the highway. Used 2013 Audi A3 Performance and Interior The A3 comes standard with a 200-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine, a six-speed manual transmission, and front-wheel drive. A3 TDI models are equipped with a turbocharged diesel engine that produces 140 horsepower. TDI models were part of Audi's emissions scandal, and they require modification to meet EPA standards. Shoppers looking for these models should be cautious, since the updates may alter performance or fuel economy. A six-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission is available with either engine. Quattro all-wheel drive is available in non-TDI A3 models only. All models have taut handling, strong brakes, and a compliant ride. The optional sport suspension limits body roll and gives the A3 better composure around turns. While the base engine has plenty of power in all situations, the turbodiesel struggles on the highway. A front-wheel-drive A3 with the base turbo-four engine and an automatic transmission returns 21 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway, which is a bit low for the class. The four-door Audi A3 hatchback has an upscale cabin with leather upholstery and seating for five. Some used models feature heated seats up front and a power-adjustable driver's seat. The front seats have plenty of room, but the rear seats are too cramped for most riders. There are two complete sets of LATCH child-seat connectors in the A3's rear seats. The A3 has 19.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, expanding to 39 cubes with them folded down. That's more room than most luxury small cars offer. Standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control and a 10-speaker audio system with an auxiliary audio port and satellite radio. Available upgrades include a Bose stereo system, Bluetooth, and a six-disc CD player. There's also an available navigation system, but its dash-mounted dial controller can be awkward to use while driving. Used 2013 Audi A3 Prices The base price of a 2013 A3 is $13,800. Expect to pay about $17,200 for a model with an automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. The price you pay depends on the vehicle's demand, features, condition, and mileage. We Did the Research for You: 117 Reviews Analyzed We researched 117 Audi A3 reviews and included information on price, reliability, fuel economy, and more to give you a complete overview of the 2013 A3. Why You Can Trust Us U.S. News Best Cars has been ranking vehicles since 2007, and our team has more than 75 years of combined experience in the auto industry. To keep our reviews unbiased, we refuse pricey gifts and trips from automakers, and a third party handles the ads on our site. How Reliable Is the 2013 Audi A3? The 2013 A3 has a reliability rating of three out of five from J.D. Power. While this is an average rating compared to all cars on the road, many luxury small cars have scores of four or better. How Safe Is the A3? The 2013 A3 has top-notch safety scores. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the A3 the highest rating of Good in all four of its crash tests. Rear parking sensors are available, but a rearview camera is not. Is the 2013 A3 the Best Model Year to Buy? The 2013 A3 is part of a generation that spans the 2006 through 2013 model years. There were no major changes between the 2011 and 2013 models. Consider a model that's a few years older if you're looking to save some money. Which Used Audi A3 Is Right for Me? The A3 comes in two trim levels: Premium and Premium Plus. The Premium Plus trim adds only a few features   xenon headlights, a power-adjustable front seat, and ambient interior lighting   so it's not really worth the upgrade. Look for models with the Cold Weather package for heated front seats, heated side mirrors, and heated windshield washer nozzles. Premium Plus models offer a Convenience package that adds other desirable features, like a Bose stereo system, automatic headlights, and rear parking sensors. You may want to consider purchasing a certified pre-owned vehicle. Audi CPO vehicles receive the balance of the original four-year/50,000-mile new-car warranty, then enjoy an additional two-year/50,000-mile comprehensive warranty. The two warranties differ in important ways, and there may be additional services like roadside assistance, so read the Audi warranty page carefully. Audi CPO models must pass an inspection covering 300-plus points. The model's original sale date determines whether or not it is eligible for the CPO program. 2013 Audi A3 and Other Cars to Consider Which Is Better: 2013 Audi A3 or 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class? The A3 and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class both offer balanced road manners and rich interiors. They also share weaknesses, like tight rear seats and infotainment issues. The A3 has more cargo space, standard leather upholstery, and a lower average price. But unlike the A3, the C-Class comes standard with a sunroof and Bluetooth. The Mercedes' available engines are more powerful than anything in the A3 lineup. In the end, these luxury small cars are closely matched competitors. Which Is Better: 2013 Audi A3 or 2013 Audi A4? The Audi A4 doesn't offer as much cargo space as its smaller sibling, but it's a better choice overall. The A4 has engaging road manners like the A3 and an upscale cabin, though both are tight in the back. The Audi A4 boasts a standard sunroof, along with a higher reliability rating and more available safety tech than the A3, like a rearview camera and adaptive cruise control. We recommend the A4 over the A3 because it's a better car with a similar price. Which Is Better: 2013 Audi A3 or 2013 BMW 1 Series? The two-door BMW 1 Series is available as a coupe or a convertible. The A3 and the 1 Series have much in common, like sharp handling and great ride comfort. Unfortunately, both models also lack adequate rear-seat room.

Reviewers say they not only taste homemade, but they're comforting to the hilt, especially when you snag one warm out of the oven.

PENNSYLVANIA: Nancy B's Bakery in West Homestead This unassuming bakeshop is the epitome of a hidden gem in large part because of its jumbo chocolate chip cookies, which you can order individually, by the half dozen, or by the dozen.

Why? Well, it's thick, soft, and chewy, and not too sweet or salty. "It's everything a chocolate chip cookie should be," says one reviewer. And if you're seeking something a little different, Baked on 8th offers a fun twist on their chocolate chip cookie with pecans and toffee bits. TEXAS: Tinys Milk & Cookies in Houston While there are a variety of cookie flavors at this walk-up bakery and ice cream shop, Yelpers say the "insanely amazing" chocolate chip can't be beat.

WASHINGTON: Hello Robin in Seattle From the moment you stroll into this cheerful, cozy bakeshop, you're bound to be hit with the aroma of cookies baking in the oven because the team is constantly making new batches throughout the day. This means your odds of getting one while it's still warm are pretty good.

WEST VIRGINIA: Apple Annie's in Morgantown Is there anything better than a delicious homemade chocolate chip cookie?

Every single item at this mom and pop bakery is made the old fashioned way, including their fruit and cream pies, muffins, cheesecakes, cannolis, and of course, their cookies. It's no wonder this quaint eatery has built up such a loyal collection of regulars. WISCONSIN: Casetta Kitchen and Counter in Madison While all the savory bites are reportedly delicious at this modern Italian-American deli, Yelpers agree that it would be a mistake to miss out on the soft-baked chocolate chip cookie, which is supple on the inside and crunchy on the outside edges. What sets it apart, according to reviewers, is the flat chocolate disks that are evenly distributed throughout, so that every layer has some chocolatey goodness. FYI, the kitchen only bakes a few dozen of these cookies each day, so the earlier you go, the better your odds of snagging one of these heavenly treats. WYOMING: Persephone Bakery in Jackson More than one reviewer went so far as to say that the "mind-blowing" chocolate chip walnut cookies at this chic French café are the best they've ever had.

AAB5RFI	movies	movies-celebrity	Jennifer Lopez gives stink eye and snaps at fiance Alex Rodriguez in behind-the-scenes Met Gala video after he asks why she's wearing a 'wig'	Jennifer Lopez got a little frustrated at her fiance Alex Rodriguez on Monday in a new behind-the-scenes YouTube video as she got ready for the Met Gala.	She was one of the Met Gala stand outs on Monday's red carpet. But Jennifer Lopez's look didn't come without seven hours of work and an army of help. Taking to her YouTube channel, the 49-year-old star gave her 10 million fans a candid behind-the-scenes look into her fittings. And the World Of Dance star was also seen getting a little snappy at fiance Alex Rodriguez, 43, who appeared to be getting in the way. While Jennifer was in the final stages of her hair and makeup, Alex decided to stop by. Her called her headpiece a wig, which frustrated the star. 'Is there a reason why you're wearing a wig?' he innocently asked while eating a salad very close to her face. 'It's not a wig, it's a beaded headpiece and it's part of the dress,' she replied somewhat sternly. 'Would you show him [Alex] what's going on on the red carpet please? Show him what's going on right now,' Jennifer requested one of her staff. But it appeared as though Alex was more confused than ever, somehow still asking the wrong questions and all while in Jennifer's personal space. 'Come, help, be in it, be in it, help out,' she said, before changing her mind. 'Sit down, sit down, I moved so you could sit down. Go sit down. I moved,' she instructed before asking a staff member for help. 'Please take him over there,' she instructed. And perhaps Alex got a little too comfortable after being kept out of the way as the former athlete unable to be found when it was time to leave. 'Where's Alex?' Jennifer asked, after being in hair and makeup for seven hours. But all was forgiven, with Jennifer giving him an air kiss to ensure nothing happened to her glam. Jennifer's Versace dress was designed by the late Luigi Massi, 53, who passed away recently while making her gown. During fittings at the beginning of the video, the Dance Again singer, who had worked with the designer for over 20 years, revealed she and the whole team cried when she first tried her dress on. 'We're saddened this year and cried during our first fitting, putting on this gown,' she said. 'Knowing Luigi was making this gown when he passed away. It's difficult, but at the same time it's also a celebration of his work.' And while the team were going through their final fittings, it was Jennifer who took the lead and directed them on how to fix it. 'He'd [Luigi] make sure I look very skinny,' she told the seamstress. 'Somehow he'd squeeze the back. So open here and close here.' Another major last minute change Jennifer made was the length of the beads on her headpiece. Originally designed to reach her stomach, she posed the idea of a 'swim cap' style to ensure nothing was taken away from the dress. 'Just an idea, you don't have to do it, nobody panic. What if we made it more like a swim cap,' she put on the table. And it all turned out just the way she had envisioned, with designers tirelessly working on the new headpiece while she was getting her makeup done. The end of the video saw Jennifer and Alex happily posing as a loved up couple on the carpet before dancing the night away to Cher.
